<p>What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!</p>

<p>&mdash;Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the
farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/11.jpg"><img src="./images/11-tb.jpg" alt="Jemima takes a stand" title="Jemima takes a stand" /></a></p>


<p>Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to
leave the hatching to some one else&mdash;&quot;I have not the patience to sit on a
nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would let
them go cold; you know you would!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,&quot; quacked
Jemima Puddle-duck.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/12.jpg"><img src="./images/12-tb.jpg" alt="Carried Off" title="Carried Off" /></a></p>


<p>She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.</p>

<p>Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate. She determined to make a nest
right away from the farm.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/15.jpg"><img src="./images/15-tb.jpg" alt="Setting Off" title="Setting Off" /></a></p>

<p>She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over
the hill.</p>

<p>She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/16.jpg"><img src="./images/16-tb.jpg" alt="Top of A Hill" title="Top of a Hill" /></a></p>


<p>When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.</p>

<p>She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/19.jpg"><img src="./images/19-tb.jpg" alt="Starting to Fly" title="Starting to Fly" /></a></p>


<p>Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. She ran downhill a
few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/20.jpg"><img src="./images/20-tb.jpg" alt="Soaring" title="Soaring" /></a></p>


<p>She flew beautifully when she had got a good start.</p>

<p>She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the
middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/23.jpg"><img src="./images/23-tb.jpg" alt="Fox-gloves" title="Fox-gloves" /></a></p>


<p>Jemima alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a
convenient dry nesting-place. She rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some
tall fox-gloves.</p>

<p>But&mdash;seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed
gentleman reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>He had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.</p>

<p>&quot;Quack?&quot; said Jemima Puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one
side&mdash;&quot;Quack?&quot;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/24.jpg"><img src="./images/24-tb.jpg" alt="Gentleman Reading" title="Gentleman Reading" /></a></p>


<p>The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at
Jemima&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Madam, have you lost your way?&quot; said he. He had a long bushy tail which
he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.</p>

<p>Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. She explained that she had
not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry
nesting-place.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/27.jpg"><img src="./images/27-tb.jpg" alt="Jemima Tells Her Troubles" title="Jemima Tells Her Troubles" /></a></p>

<p>&quot;Ah! is that so? indeed!&quot; said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking
curiously at Jemima. He folded up the newspaper, and put it in his
coat-tail pocket.</p>

<p>Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed! how interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would
teach it to mind its own business!&quot;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/28.jpg"><img src="./images/28-tb.jpg" alt="The Shed" title="The Shed" /></a></p>

<p>&quot;But as to a nest&mdash;there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in
my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may sit
there as long as you like,&quot; said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.</p>

<p>He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the
fox-gloves.</p>

<p>It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on
top of another, by way of a chimney.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/31.jpg"><img src="./images/31-tb.jpg" alt="Closing the Door" title="Closing the Door" /></a></p>


<p>&quot;This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth&mdash;my winter
house&mdash;so convenient,&quot; said the hospitable gentleman.</p>

<p>There was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old
soap-boxes. The gentleman opened the door, and showed Jemima in.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/32.jpg"><img src="./images/32-tb.jpg" alt="A Cozy Nest" title="A Cozy Nest" /></a></p>


<p>The shed was almost quite full of feathers&mdash;it was almost suffocating; but
it was comfortable and very soft.</p>

<p>Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of
feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any
trouble at all.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/35.jpg"><img src="./images/35-tb.jpg" alt="So Polite" title="So Polite" /></a></p>


<p>When she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log
reading the newspaper&mdash;at least he had it spread out, but he was looking
over the top of it.</p>

<p>He was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for
the night. He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back
again next day.</p>

<p>He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine
nestful in his wood-shed.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/36.jpg"><img src="./images/36-tb.jpg" alt="So Attentive" title="So Attentive" /></a></p>

<p>Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest.
They were greeny white and very large. The foxy gentleman admired them
immensely. He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not
there.</p>

<p>At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day&mdash;&quot;and I
will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until
the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold,&quot; said the conscientious
Jemima.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/39.jpg"><img src="./images/39-tb.jpg" alt="A Request" title="A Request" /></a></p>


<p>&quot;Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats.
But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a
treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!</p>

<p>&quot;May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a
savoury omelette? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some
parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff&mdash;lard for the omelette,&quot; said
the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/40.jpg"><img src="./images/40-tb.jpg" alt="Herb-gathering" title="Herb-gathering" /></a></p>


<p>Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and
onions made her suspicious.</p>

<p>She went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different
sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/43.jpg"><img src="./images/43-tb.jpg" alt="Telling Kep All" title="Telling Kep All" /></a></p>

<p>And she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.</p>

<p>The collie-dog Kep met her coming out, &quot;What are you doing with those
onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?&quot;</p>

<p>Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.</p>

<p>The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she
described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/44.jpg"><img src="./images/44-tb.jpg" alt="Kep Goes Looking" title="Kep Goes Looking" /></a></p>


<p>He asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of
the house and shed.</p>

<p>Then he went out, and trotted down the village. He went to look for two
fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/47.jpg"><img src="./images/47-tb.jpg" alt="Jemima Brings Herbs" title="Jemima Brings Herbs" /></a></p>

<p>Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny
afternoon. She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in
a bag.</p>

<p>She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy
long-tailed gentleman.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/48.jpg"><img src="./images/48-tb.jpg" alt="Kep Watches" title="Kep Watches" /></a></p>


<p>He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily
round the wood. When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.</p>

<p>&quot;Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. Give me the
herbs for the omelette. Be sharp!&quot;</p>

<p>He was rather abrupt. Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like
that.</p>

<p>She felt surprised, and uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/51.jpg"><img src="./images/51-tb.jpg" alt="Kep and Friends" title="Kep and Friends" /></a></p>

<p>While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed.
Some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then
locked it.</p>

<p>Jemima became much alarmed.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/52.jpg"><img src="./images/52-tb.jpg" alt="Chasing" title="Chasing" /></a></p>

<p>A moment afterwards there were most awful noises&mdash;barking, baying, growls
and howls, squealing and groans.</p>

<p>And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.</p>

<p>Presently Kep opened the door of the shed, and let out Jemima Puddle-duck.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/55.jpg"><img src="./images/55-tb.jpg" alt="Unlocked" title="Unlocked" /></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he
could stop them.</p>

<p>He had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/57.jpg"><img src="./images/57-tb.jpg" alt="In Tears" title="In Tears" /></a></p>

<p>Jemima Puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/58.jpg"><img src="./images/58-tb.jpg" alt="Ducklings" title="Ducklings" /></a></p>

<p>She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself:
but only four of them hatched.</p>

<p>Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had
always been a bad sitter.</p>

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
