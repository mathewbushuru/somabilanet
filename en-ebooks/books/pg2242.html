<p id="id00014" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id00015" style="margin-top: 2em">We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.</p>

<p id="id00016">Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.</p>

<p id="id00017" style="margin-top: 2em">Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p id="id00018">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.</p>

<p id="id00019">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p id="id00020">At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.</p>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.</p>

<p id="id00037">*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.</p>

<p id="id00038">ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p id="id00039">To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

<p id="id00041">If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.</p>

<p id="id00054" style="margin-top: 5em">Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's The first Part of<br/>

Henry the Sixt<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00055" style="margin-top: 4em">Executive Director's Notes:</p>

<p id="id00056">In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
are presented herein:</p>

<p id="id00057">  Barnardo. Who's there?<br/>

  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand &amp; vnfold<br/>

your selfe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00058">   Bar. Long liue the King</p>

<p id="id00059">***</p>

<p id="id00060">As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .</p>

<p id="id00061">The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.</p>

<p id="id00062">You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.</p>

<p id="id00063">So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
that are "not" errors. . . .</p>

<p id="id00064">So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The first
Part of Henry the Sixt.</p>

<p id="id00067" style="margin-top: 2em">Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text.</p>

<p id="id00068">The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare.</p>

<p id="id00069">Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions' best pages.</p>

<p id="id00070">If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.</p>

<p id="id00094">   Lys. You haue her fathers loue, Demetrius:<br/>

Let me haue Hermiaes: do you marry him<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00095">   Egeus. Scornfull Lysander, true, he hath my Loue;<br/>

And what is mine, my loue shall render him.<br/>

And she is mine, and all my right of her,<br/>

I do estate vnto Demetrius<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00096">   Lys. I am my Lord, as well deriu'd as he,<br/>

As well possest: my loue is more then his:<br/>

My fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd<br/>

(If not with vantage) as Demetrius:<br/>

And (which is more then all these boasts can be)<br/>

I am belou'd of beauteous Hermia.<br/>

Why should not I then prosecute my right?<br/>

Demetrius, Ile auouch it to his head,<br/>

Made loue to Nedars daughter, Helena,<br/>

And won her soule: and she (sweet Ladie) dotes,<br/>

Deuoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry,<br/>

Vpon this spotted and inconstant man<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00097">   The. I must confesse, that I haue heard so much,<br/>

And with Demetrius thought to haue spoke thereof:<br/>

But being ouer-full of selfe-affaires,<br/>

My minde did lose it. But Demetrius come,<br/>

And come Egeus, you shall go with me,<br/>

I haue some priuate schooling for you both.<br/>

For you faire Hermia, looke you arme your selfe,<br/>

To fit your fancies to your Fathers will;<br/>

Or else the Law of Athens yeelds you vp<br/>

(Which by no meanes we may extenuate)<br/>

To death, or to a vow of single life.<br/>

Come my Hippolita, what cheare my loue?<br/>

Demetrius and Egeus go along:<br/>

I must imploy you in some businesse<br/>

Against our nuptiall, and conferre with you<br/>

Of something, neerely that concernes your selues<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00098">   Ege. With dutie and desire we follow you.</p>

<p id="id00099">Exeunt.</p>

<p id="id00100">Manet Lysander and Hermia.</p>

<p id="id00101">  Lys. How now my loue? Why is your cheek so pale?<br/>

How chance the Roses there do fade so fast?<br/>

  Her. Belike for want of raine, which I could well<br/>

Beteeme them, from the tempest of mine eyes<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00102">   Lys. For ought that euer I could reade,<br/>

Could euer heare by tale or historie,<br/>

The course of true loue neuer did run smooth,<br/>

But either it was different in blood<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00103">   Her. O crosse! too high to be enthral'd to loue</p>

<p id="id00104">   Lys. Or else misgraffed, in respect of yeares</p>

<p id="id00105">   Her. O spight! too old to be ingag'd to yong</p>

<p id="id00106">   Lys. Or else it stood vpon the choise of merit</p>

<p id="id00107">   Her. O hell! to choose loue by anothers eie</p>

<p id="id00108">   Lys. Or if there were a simpathie in choise,<br/>

Warre, death, or sicknesse, did lay siege to it;<br/>

Making it momentarie, as a sound:<br/>

Swift as a shadow, short as any dreame,<br/>

Briefe as the lightning in the collied night,<br/>

That (in a spleene) vnfolds both heauen and earth;<br/>

And ere a man hath power to say, behold,<br/>

The iawes of darkness do deuoure it vp:<br/>

So quicke bright things come to confusion<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00109">   Her. If then true Louers haue beene euer crost,<br/>

It stands as an edict in destinie:<br/>

Then let vs teach our triall patience,<br/>

Because it is a customarie crosse,<br/>

As due to loue, as thoughts, and dreames, and sighes,<br/>

Wishes and teares; poore Fancies followers<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00110">   Lys. A good perswasion; therefore heare me Hermia,<br/>

I haue a Widdow Aunt, a dowager,<br/>

Of great reuennew, and she hath no childe,<br/>

From Athens is her house remou'd seuen leagues,<br/>

And she respects me, as her onely sonne:<br/>

There gentle Hermia, may I marrie thee,<br/>

And to that place, the sharpe Athenian Law<br/>

Cannot pursue vs. If thou lou'st me, then<br/>

Steale forth thy Fathers house to morrow night:<br/>

And in the wood, a league without the towne,<br/>

(Where I did meete thee once with Helena.<br/>

To do obseruance for a morne of May)<br/>

There will I stay for thee<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00111">   Her. My good Lysander,<br/>

I sweare to thee, by Cupids strongest bow,<br/>

By his best arrow with the golden head,<br/>

By the simplicitie of Venus Doues,<br/>

By that which knitteth soules, and prospers loue,<br/>

And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queene,<br/>

When the false Troyan vnder saile was seene,<br/>

By all the vowes that euer men haue broke,<br/>

(In number more then euer women spoke)<br/>

In that same place thou hast appointed me,<br/>

To morrow truly will I meete with thee<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00112">   Lys. Keepe promise loue: looke here comes Helena.<br/>

Enter Helena.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00113">  Her. God speede faire Helena, whither away?<br/>

  Hel. Cal you me faire? that faire againe vnsay,<br/>

Demetrius loues you faire: O happie faire!<br/>

Your eyes are loadstarres, and your tongues sweete ayre<br/>

More tuneable then Larke to shepheards eare,<br/>

When wheate is greene, when hauthorne buds appeare,<br/>

Sicknesse is catching: O were fauor so,<br/>

Your words I catch, faire Hermia ere I go,<br/>

My eare should catch your voice, my eye, your eye,<br/>

My tongue should catch your tongues sweete melodie,<br/>

Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,<br/>

The rest Ile giue to be to you translated.<br/>

O teach me how you looke, and with what art<br/>

You sway the motion of Demetrius hart<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00114">   Her. I frowne vpon him, yet he loues me still</p>

<p id="id00115" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Hel. O that your frownes would teach my smiles
such skil</p>

<p id="id00116">   Her. I giue him curses, yet he giues me loue</p>

<p id="id00117">   Hel. O that my prayers could such affection mooue</p>

<p id="id00118">   Her. The more I hate, the more he followes me</p>

<p id="id00119">   Hel. The more I loue, the more he hateth me</p>

  Her. Take comfort: he no more shall see my face,<br/>

Lysander and my selfe will flie this place.<br/>

Before the time I did Lysander see,<br/>

Seem'd Athens like a Paradise to mee.<br/>

O then, what graces in my Loue do dwell,<br/>

That he hath turn'd a heauen into hell<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00122">   Lys. Helen, to you our mindes we will vnfold,<br/>

To morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold<br/>

Her siluer visage, in the watry glasse,<br/>

Decking with liquid pearle, the bladed grasse<br/>

(A time that Louers flights doth still conceale)<br/>

Through Athens gates, haue we deuis'd to steale<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00123">   Her. And in the wood, where often you and I,<br/>

Vpon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lye,<br/>

Emptying our bosomes, of their counsell sweld:<br/>

There my Lysander, and my selfe shall meete,<br/>

And thence from Athens turne away our eyes<br/>

To seeke new friends and strange companions,<br/>

Farwell sweet play-fellow, pray thou for vs,<br/>

And good lucke grant thee thy Demetrius.<br/>

Keepe word Lysander we must starue our sight,<br/>

From louers foode, till morrow deepe midnight.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00124">Exit Hermia.</p>

<p id="id00125">  Lys. I will my Hermia. Helena adieu,<br/>

As you on him, Demetrius dotes on you.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00126">Exit Lysander.</p>

<p id="id00127">  Hele. How happy some, ore othersome can be?<br/>

Through Athens I am thought as faire as she.<br/>

But what of that? Demetrius thinkes not so:<br/>

He will not know, what all, but he doth know,<br/>

And as hee erres, doting on Hermias eyes;<br/>

So I, admiring of his qualities:<br/>

Things base and vilde, holding no quantity,<br/>

Loue can transpose to forme and dignity,<br/>

Loue lookes not with the eyes, but with the minde,<br/>

And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blinde.<br/>

Nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste:<br/>

Wings and no eyes, figure, vnheedy haste.<br/>

And therefore is Loue said to be a childe,<br/>

Because in choise he is often beguil'd,<br/>

As waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare;<br/>

So the boy Loue is periur'd euery where.<br/>

For ere Demetrius lookt on Hermias eyne,<br/>

He hail'd downe oathes that he was onely mine.<br/>

And when this Haile some heat from Hermia felt,<br/>

So he dissolu'd, and showres of oathes did melt,<br/>

I will goe tell him of faire Hermias flight:<br/>

Then to the wood will he, to morrow night<br/>

Pursue her; and for his intelligence,<br/>

If I haue thankes, it is a deere expence:<br/>

But heerein meane I to enrich my paine,<br/>

To haue his sight thither, and backe againe.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00128">Enter Quince the Carpenter, Snug the Ioyner, Bottome the Weauer,
Flute
the bellowes-mender, Snout the Tinker, and Starueling the Taylor.</p>

<p id="id00129">  Quin. Is all our company heere?<br/>

  Bot. You were best to call them generally, man by<br/>

man according to the scrip<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00130">   Qui. Here is the scrowle of euery mans name, which
is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our Enterlude
before the Duke and the Dutches, on his wedding
day at night</p>

<p id="id00131">   Bot. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
on: then read the names of the Actors: and so grow on
to a point</p>

<p id="id00132" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Quin. Marry our play is the most lamentable comedy,
and most cruell death of Pyramus and Thisbie</p>

<p id="id00133">   Bot. A very good peece of worke I assure you, and a
merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your Actors
by the scrowle. Masters spread your selues</p>

<p id="id00134">   Quince. Answere as I call you. Nick Bottome the<br/>

Weauer<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00135">   Bottome. Ready; name what part I am for, and<br/>

proceed<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00136">   Quince. You Nicke Bottome are set downe for Pyramus</p>

<p id="id00137">   Bot. What is Pyramus, a louer, or a tyrant?<br/>

  Quin. A Louer that kills himselfe most gallantly for<br/>

loue<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00138">   Bot. That will aske some teares in the true performing
of it: if I do it, let the audience looke to their eies:
I will mooue stormes; I will condole in some measure.
To the rest yet, my chiefe humour is for a tyrant. I could
play Ercles rarely, or a part to teare a Cat in, to make all
split the raging Rocks; and shiuering shocks shall break
the locks of prison gates, and Phibbus carre shall shine
from farre, and make and marre the foolish Fates. This
was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This
is Ercles vaine, a tyrants vaine: a louer is more condoling</p>

<p id="id00139">   Quin. Francis Flute the Bellowes-mender</p>

<p id="id00140">   Flu. Heere Peter Quince</p>

<p id="id00141">   Quin. You must take Thisbie on you</p>

<p id="id00142">   Flut. What is Thisbie, a wandring Knight?<br/>

  Quin. It is the Lady that Pyramus must loue<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00143">   Flut. Nay faith, let not mee play a woman, I haue a<br/>

beard comming<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00144">   Qui. That's all one, you shall play it in a Maske, and<br/>

you may speake as small as you will<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00145">   Bot. And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbie too:<br/>

Ile speake in a monstrous little voyce; Thisne, Thisne, ah<br/>

Pyramus my louer deare, thy Thisbie deare, and Lady<br/>

deare<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00146">   Quin. No no, you must play Pyramus, and Flute, you<br/>

Thisby<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00147">   Bot. Well, proceed</p>

<p id="id00148">   Qu. Robin Starueling the Taylor</p>

<p id="id00149">   Star. Heere Peter Quince</p>

<p id="id00150">   Quince. Robin Starueling, you must play Thisbies<br/>

mother?<br/>

Tom Snowt, the Tinker<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00151">   Snowt. Heere Peter Quince</p>

<p id="id00152">   Quin. you, Pyramus father; my self, Thisbies father;
Snugge the Ioyner, you the Lyons part: and I hope there
is a play fitted</p>

<p id="id00153">   Snug. Haue you the Lions part written? pray you if<br/>

be, giue it me, for I am slow of studie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00154">   Quin. You may doe it extemporie, for it is nothing<br/>

but roaring<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00155">   Bot. Let mee play the Lyon too, I will roare that I
will doe any mans heart good to heare me. I will roare,
that I will make the Duke say, Let him roare againe, let
him roare againe</p>

<p id="id00156">   Quin. If you should do it too terribly, you would
fright the Dutchesse and the Ladies, that they would
shrike, and that were enough to hang us all</p>

<p id="id00157">   All. That would hang vs euery mothers sonne</p>

<p id="id00158">   Bottome. I graunt you friends, if that you should
fright the Ladies out of their Wittes, they would
haue no more discretion but to hang vs: but I will aggrauate
my voyce so, that I will roare you as gently as
any sucking Doue; I will roare and 'twere any Nightingale</p>

<p id="id00159">   Quin. You can play no part but Piramus, for Piramus
is a sweet-fac'd man, a proper man as one shall see in
a summers day; a most louely Gentleman-like man, therfore
you must needs play Piramus</p>

<p id="id00160">   Bot. Well, I will vndertake it. What beard were I<br/>

best to play it in?<br/>

  Quin. Why, what you will<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00161">   Bot. I will discharge it, in either your straw-colour
beard, your orange tawnie beard, your purple in graine
beard, or your French-crowne colour'd beard, your perfect
yellow</p>

<p id="id00162">   Quin. Some of your French Crownes haue no haire
at all, and then you will play bare-fac'd. But masters here
are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and
desire you, to con them by too morrow night: and meet
me in the palace wood, a mile without the Towne, by
Moone-light, there we will rehearse: for if we meete in
the Citie, we shalbe dog'd with company, and our deuises
knowne. In the meane time, I wil draw a bil of properties,
such as our play wants. I pray you faile me not</p>

<p id="id00163">   Bottom. We will meete, and there we may rehearse
more obscenely and couragiously. Take paines, be perfect,
adieu</p>

<p id="id00164">   Quin. At the Dukes oake we meete</p>

<p id="id00165">   Bot. Enough, hold or cut bow-strings.</p>

<p id="id00166">Exeunt.</p>

<p id="id00167">Actus Secundus.</p>

<p id="id00168">Enter a Fairie at one dore, and Robin goodfellow at another.</p>

<p id="id00169">  Rob. How now spirit, whether wander you?<br/>

  Fai. Ouer hil, ouer dale, through bush, through briar,<br/>

Ouer parke, ouer pale, through flood, through fire,<br/>

I do wander euerie where, swifter then y Moons sphere;<br/>

And I serue the Fairy Queene, to dew her orbs vpon the green.<br/>

The Cowslips tall, her pensioners bee,<br/>

In their gold coats, spots you see,<br/>

Those be Rubies, Fairie fauors,<br/>

In those freckles, liue their sauors,<br/>

I must go seeke some dew drops heere,<br/>

And hang a pearle in euery cowslips eare.<br/>

Farewell thou Lob of spirits, Ile be gon,<br/>

Our Queene and all her Elues come heere anon<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00170">   Rob. The King doth keepe his Reuels here to night,<br/>

Take heed the Queene come not within his sight,<br/>

For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br/>

Because that she, as her attendant, hath<br/>

A louely boy stolne from an Indian King,<br/>

She neuer had so sweet a changeling,<br/>

And iealous Oberon would haue the childe<br/>

Knight of his traine, to trace the Forrests wilde.<br/>

But she (perforce) with-holds the loued boy,<br/>

Crownes him with flowers, and makes him all her ioy.<br/>

And now they neuer meete in groue, or greene,<br/>

By fountaine cleere, or spangled star-light sheene,<br/>

But they do square, that all their Elues for feare<br/>

Creepe into Acorne cups and hide them there<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00171">   Fai. Either I mistake your shape and making quite,<br/>

Or else you are that shrew'd and knauish spirit<br/>

Cal'd Robin Good-fellow. Are you not hee,<br/>

That frights the maidens of the Villagree,<br/>

Skim milke, and sometimes labour in the querne,<br/>

And bootlesse make the breathlesse huswife cherne,<br/>

And sometime make the drinke to beare no barme,<br/>

Misleade night-wanderers, laughing at their harme,<br/>

Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Pucke,<br/>

You do their worke, and they shall haue good lucke.<br/>

Are not you he?<br/>

  Rob. Thou speak'st aright;<br/>

I am that merrie wanderer of the night:<br/>

I iest to Oberon, and make him smile,<br/>

When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br/>

Neighing in likenesse of a silly foale,<br/>

And sometime lurke I in a Gossips bole,<br/>

In very likenesse of a roasted crab:<br/>

And when she drinkes, against her lips I bob,<br/>

And on her withered dewlop poure the Ale.<br/>

The wisest Aunt telling the saddest tale,<br/>

Sometime for three-foot stoole, mistaketh me,<br/>

Then slip I from her bum, downe topples she,<br/>

And tailour cries, and fals into a coffe.<br/>

And then the whole quire hold their hips, and loffe,<br/>

And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and sweare,<br/>

A merrier houre was neuer wasted there.<br/>

But roome Fairy, heere comes Oberon<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00172">   Fair. And heere my Mistris:<br/>

Would that he were gone.<br/>

Enter the King of Fairies at one doore with his traine, and the<br/>

Queene at<br/>

another with hers.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00173">  Ob. Ill met by Moone-light.<br/>

Proud Tytania<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00174">   Qu. What, iealous Oberon? Fairy skip hence.<br/>

I haue forsworne his bed and companie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00175">   Ob. Tarrie rash Wanton; am not I thy Lord?<br/>

  Qu. Then I must be thy Lady: but I know<br/>

When thou wast stolne away from Fairy Land,<br/>

And in the shape of Corin, sate all day,<br/>

Playing on pipes of Corne, and versing loue<br/>

To amorous Phillida. Why art thou heere<br/>

Come from the farthest steepe of India?<br/>

But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon<br/>

Your buskin'd Mistresse, and your Warrior loue,<br/>

To Theseus must be Wedded; and you come,<br/>

To giue their bed ioy and prosperitie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00176">   Ob. How canst thou thus for shame Tytania.<br/>

Glance at my credite, with Hippolita?<br/>

Knowing I know thy loue to Theseus?<br/>

Didst thou not leade him through the glimmering night<br/>

From Peregenia, whom he rauished?<br/>

And make him with faire Eagles breake his faith<br/>

With Ariadne, and Antiopa?<br/>

  Que. These are the forgeries of iealousie,<br/>

And neuer since the middle Summers spring<br/>

Met we on hil, in dale, forrest, or mead,<br/>

By paued fountaine, or by rushie brooke,<br/>

Or in the beached margent of the sea,<br/>

To dance our ringlets to the whistling Winde,<br/>

But with thy braules thou hast disturb'd our sport.<br/>

Therefore the Windes, piping to vs in vaine,<br/>

As in reuenge, haue suck'd vp from the sea<br/>

Contagious fogges: Which falling in the Land,<br/>

Hath euerie petty Riuer made so proud,<br/>

That they haue ouer-borne their Continents.<br/>

The Oxe hath therefore stretch'd his yoake in vaine,<br/>

The Ploughman lost his sweat, and the greene Corne<br/>

Hath rotted, ere his youth attain'd a beard:<br/>

The fold stands empty in the drowned field,<br/>

And Crowes are fatted with the murrion flocke,<br/>

The nine mens Morris is fild vp with mud,<br/>

And the queint Mazes in the wanton greene,<br/>

For lacke of tread are vndistinguishable.<br/>

The humane mortals want their winter heere,<br/>

No night is now with hymne or caroll blest;<br/>

Therefore the Moone (the gouernesse of floods)<br/>

Pale in her anger, washes all the aire;<br/>

That Rheumaticke diseases doe abound.<br/>

And through this distemperature, we see<br/>

The seasons alter; hoared headed Frosts<br/>

Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose,<br/>

And on old Hyems chinne and Icie crowne,<br/>

An odorous Chaplet of sweet Sommer buds<br/>

Is as in mockry set. The Spring, the Sommer,<br/>

The childing Autumne, angry Winter change<br/>

Their wonted Liueries, and the mazed world,<br/>

By their increase, now knowes not which is which;<br/>

And this same progeny of euills,<br/>

Comes from our debate, from our dissention,<br/>

We are their parents and originall<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00177">   Ober. Do you amend it then, it lies in you,<br/>

Why should Titania crosse her Oberon?<br/>

I do but beg a little changeling boy,<br/>

To be my Henchman<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00178">   Qu. Set your heart at rest,<br/>

The Fairy land buyes not the childe of me,<br/>

His mother was a Votresse of my Order,<br/>

And in the spiced Indian aire, by night<br/>

Full often hath she gossipt by my side,<br/>

And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands,<br/>

Marking th' embarked traders on the flood,<br/>

When we haue laught to see the sailes conceiue,<br/>

And grow big bellied with the wanton winde:<br/>

Which she with pretty and with swimming gate,<br/>

Following (her wombe then rich with my yong squire)<br/>

Would imitate, and saile vpon the Land,<br/>

To fetch me trifles, and returne againe,<br/>

As from a voyage, rich with merchandize.<br/>

But she being mortall, of that boy did die,<br/>

And for her sake I doe reare vp her boy,<br/>

And for her sake I will not part with him<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00179">   Ob. How long within this wood intend you stay?<br/>

  Qu. Perchance till after Theseus wedding day.<br/>

If you will patiently dance in our Round,<br/>

And see our Moone-light reuels, goe with vs;<br/>

If not, shun me and I will spare your haunts<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00180">   Ob. Giue me that boy, and I will goe with thee</p>

<p id="id00181">   Qu. Not for thy Fairy Kingdome. Fairies away:<br/>

We shall chide downe right, if I longer stay.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00182">Exeunt</p>

<p id="id00183">   Ob. Wel, go thy way: thou shalt not from this groue,<br/>

Till I torment thee for this iniury.<br/>

My gentle Pucke come hither; thou remembrest<br/>

Since once I sat vpon a promontory,<br/>

And heard a Meare-maide on a Dolphins backe,<br/>

Vttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,<br/>

That the rude sea grew ciuill at her song,<br/>

And certaine starres shot madly from their Spheares,<br/>

To heare the Sea-maids musicke<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00184">   Puc. I remember</p>

<p id="id00185">   Ob. That very time I say (but thou couldst not)<br/>

Flying betweene the cold Moone and the earth,<br/>

Cupid all arm'd; a certaine aime he tooke<br/>

At a faire Vestall, throned by the West,<br/>

And loos'd his loue-shaft smartly from his bow,<br/>

As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts,<br/>

But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft<br/>

Quencht in the chaste beames of the watry Moone;<br/>

And the imperiall Votresse passed on,<br/>

In maiden meditation, fancy free.<br/>

Yet markt I where the bolt of Cupid fell.<br/>

It fell vpon a little westerne flower;<br/>

Before, milke-white: now purple with loues wound,<br/>

And maidens call it, Loue in idlenesse.<br/>

Fetch me that flower; the hearb I shew'd thee once,<br/>

The iuyce of it, on sleeping eye-lids laid,<br/>

Will make or man or woman madly dote<br/>

Vpon the next liue creature that it sees.<br/>

Fetch me this hearbe, and be thou heere againe,<br/>

Ere the Leuiathan can swim a league<br/>

<p id="id00186">   Pucke. Ile put a girdle about the earth, in forty minutes</p>

And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:<br/>

The next thing when she waking lookes vpon,<br/>

On medling Monkey, or on busie Ape)<br/>

Shee shall pursue it, with the soule of loue.<br/>

And ere I take this charme off from her sight,<br/>

(As I can take it with another hearbe)<br/>

Ile make her render vp her Page to me.<br/>

I am your spaniell, and Demetrius,<br/>

The more you beat me, I will fawne on you.<br/>

Vse me but as your spaniell; spurne me, strike me,<br/>

Neglect me, lose me; onely giue me leaue<br/>

(Vnworthy as I am) to follow you.<br/>

With the rich worth of your virginity<br/>

For you in my respect are all the world.<br/>

Then how can it be said I am alone,<br/>

When all the world is heere to looke on me?<br/>

Makes speed to catch the Tyger. Bootlesse speede,<br/>

There sleepes Tytania, sometime of the night,<br/>

Lul'd in these flowers, with dances and delight:<br/>

And there the snake throwes her enammel'd skinne,<br/>

Weed wide enough to rap a Fairy in.<br/>

And with the iuyce of this Ile streake her eyes,<br/>

With a disdainefull youth: annoint his eyes,<br/>

Such separation, as may well be said,<br/>

Becomes a vertuous batchelour, and a maide,<br/>

If so, my eyes are oftner washt then hers.<br/>

No, no, I am as vgly as a Beare;<br/>

But you must flout my insufficiency?<br/>

Good troth you do me wrong (good-sooth you do)<br/>

In such disdainfull manner, me to wooe.<br/>

<p id="id00232">Enter the Clownes.</p>

<p id="id00233">  Bot. Are we all met?
  Quin. Pat, pat, and here's a maruailous conuenient
place for our rehearsall. This greene plot shall be our
stage, this hauthorne brake our tyring house, and we will
do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke</p>

<p id="id00234">   Bot. Peter Quince?<br/>

  Peter. What saist thou, bully Bottome?<br/>

  Bot. There are things in this Comedy of Piramus and<br/>

Thisby, that will neuer please. First, Piramus must draw a<br/>

sword to kill himselfe; which the Ladies cannot abide.<br/>

How answere you that?<br/>

  Snout. Berlaken, a parlous feare<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00235">   Star. I beleeue we must leaue the killing out, when<br/>

all is done<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00236">   Bot. Not a whit, I haue a deuice to make all well.
Write me a Prologue, and let the Prologue seeme to say,
we will do no harme with our swords, and that Pyramus
is not kill'd indeede: and for the more better assurance,
tell them, that I Piramus am not Piramus, but Bottome the
Weauer; this will put them out of feare</p>

<p id="id00237">   Quin. Well, we will haue such a Prologue, and it shall<br/>

be written in eight and sixe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00238">   Bot. No, make it two more, let it be written in eight<br/>

and eight<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00239">   Snout. Will not the Ladies be afear'd of the Lyon?<br/>

  Star. I feare it, I promise you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00240">   Bot. Masters, you ought to consider with your selues, to
bring in (God shield vs) a Lyon among Ladies, is a most
dreadfull thing. For there is not a more fearefull wilde
foule then your Lyon liuing: and wee ought to looke
to it</p>

<p id="id00241" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Snout. Therefore another Prologue must tell he is not
a Lyon</p>

<p id="id00242">   Bot. Nay, you must name his name, and halfe his face
must be seene through the Lyons necke, and he himselfe
must speake through, saying thus, or to the same defect;
Ladies, or faire Ladies, I would wish you, or I would
request you, or I would entreat you, not to feare, not to
tremble: my life for yours. If you thinke I come hither
as a Lyon, it were pitty of my life. No, I am no such
thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let
him name his name, and tell him plainly hee is Snug the
ioyner</p>

<p id="id00243">   Quin. Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard
things, that is, to bring the Moone-light into a chamber:
for you know Piramus and Thisby meete by Moonelight</p>

<p id="id00244">   Sn. Doth the Moone shine that night wee play our<br/>

play?<br/>

  Bot. A Calender, a Calender, looke in the Almanack,<br/>

finde out Moone-shine, finde out Moone-shine.<br/>

Enter Pucke.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00245">  Quin. Yes, it doth shine that night</p>

<p id="id00246">   Bot. Why then may you leaue a casement of the great
chamber window (where we play) open, and the Moone
may shine in at the casement</p>

<p id="id00247">   Quin. I, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
and a lanthorne, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present
the person of Moone-shine. Then there is another
thing, we must haue a wall in the great Chamber; for Piramus
and Thisby (saies the story) did talke through the
chinke of a wall</p>

<p id="id00248">   Sn. You can neuer bring in a wall. What say you
Bottome?
  Bot. Some man or other must present wall, and let
him haue some Plaster, or some Lome, or some rough
cast about him, to signifie wall; or let him hold his fingers
thus; and through that cranny shall Piramus and
Thisby whisper</p>

<p id="id00249">   Quin. If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit
downe euery mothers sonne, and rehearse your parts.
Piramus, you begin; when you haue spoken your speech,
enter into that Brake, and so euery one according to his
cue.
Enter Robin.</p>

Feede him with Apricocks, and Dewberries,<br/>

With purple Grapes, greene Figs, and Mulberries,<br/>

The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees,<br/>

And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighes,<br/>

And light them at the fierie-Glow-wormes eyes,<br/>

To haue my loue to bed, and to arise:<br/>

And plucke the wings from painted Butterflies,<br/>

To fan the Moone-beames from his sleeping eies.<br/>

Nod to him Elues, and doe him curtesies<br/>

Enter Pucke.<br/>

<p id="id00287">Here comes my messenger: how now mad spirit,<br/>

What night-rule now about this haunted groue?<br/>

  Puck. My Mistris with a monster is in loue,<br/>

Neere to her close and consecrated bower,<br/>

While she was in her dull and sleeping hower,<br/>

A crew of patches, rude Mechanicals,<br/>

That worke for bread vpon Athenian stals,<br/>

Were met together to rehearse a Play,<br/>

Intended for great Theseus nuptiall day:<br/>

The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,<br/>

Who Piramus presented, in their sport,<br/>

Forsooke his Scene, and entred in a brake,<br/>

When I did him at this aduantage take,<br/>

An Asses nole I fixed on his head.<br/>

Anon his Thisbie must be answered,<br/>

And forth my Mimmick comes: when they him spie,<br/>

As Wilde-geese, that the creeping Fowler eye,<br/>

Or russed-pated choughes, many in sort<br/>

(Rising and cawing at the guns report)<br/>

Seuer themselues, and madly sweepe the skye:<br/>

So at his sight, away his fellowes flye,<br/>

And at our stampe, here ore and ore one fals;<br/>

He murther cries, and helpe from Athens cals.<br/>

Their sense thus weake, lost with their feares thus strong,<br/>

Made senslesse things begin to do them wrong.<br/>

For briars and thornes at their apparell snatch,<br/>

Some sleeues, some hats, from yeelders all things catch,<br/>

I led them on in this distracted feare,<br/>

And left sweete Piramus translated there:<br/>

When in that moment (so it came to passe)<br/>

Tytania waked, and straightway lou'd an Asse<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00288">   Ob. This fals out better then I could deuise:<br/>

But hast thou yet lacht the Athenians eyes,<br/>

With the loue iuyce, as I bid thee doe?<br/>

And the Athenian woman by his side,<br/>

That when he wak't, of force she must be eyde.<br/>

Enter Demetrius and Hermia.<br/>

<p id="id00289">  Ob. Stand close, this is the same Athenian</p>

<p id="id00290">   Rob. This is the woman, but not this the man</p>

<p id="id00291">   Dem. O why rebuke you him that loues you so?<br/>

Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00292">   Her. Now I but chide, but I should vse thee worse.<br/>

For thou (I feare) hast giuen me cause to curse,<br/>

If thou hast slaine Lysander in his sleepe,<br/>

Being oreshooes in bloud, plunge in the deepe, and kill<br/>

me too:<br/>

The Sunne was not so true vnto the day,<br/>

As he to me. Would he haue stollen away,<br/>

From sleeping Hermia? Ile beleeue as soone<br/>

This whole earth may be bord, and that the Moone<br/>

May through the Center creepe, and so displease<br/>

Her brothers noonetide, with th'Antipodes.<br/>

It cannot be but thou hast murdred him,<br/>

So should a murtherer looke, so dead, so grim<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00293">   Dem. So should the murderer looke, and so should I,<br/>

Pierst through the heart with your stearne cruelty:<br/>

Yet you the murderer lookes as bright as cleare,<br/>

As yonder Venus in her glimmering spheare<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00294">   Her. What's this to my Lysander? where is he?<br/>

Ah good Demetrius, wilt thou giue him me?<br/>

  Dem. I'de rather giue his carkasse to my hounds<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00295">   Her. Out dog, out cur, thou driu'st me past the bounds<br/>

Of maidens patience. Hast thou slaine him then?<br/>

Henceforth be neuer numbred among men.<br/>

Oh, once tell true, euen for my sake,<br/>

Durst thou a lookt vpon him, being awake?<br/>

And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O braue tutch:<br/>

Could not a worme, an Adder do so much?<br/>

An Adder did it: for with doubler tongue<br/>

Then thine (thou serpent) neuer Adder stung<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00296">   Dem. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood,<br/>

I am not guiltie of Lysanders blood:<br/>

Nor is he dead for ought that I can tell<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00297">   Her. I pray thee tell me then that he is well</p>

<p id="id00298">   Dem. And if I could, what should I get therefore?<br/>

  Her. A priuiledge, neuer to see me more;<br/>

And from thy hated presence part I: see me no more<br/>

Whether he be dead or no.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00299">  Dem. There is no following her in this fierce vaine,<br/>

Here therefore for a while I will remaine.<br/>

So sorrowes heauinesse doth heauier grow:<br/>

For debt that bankrout slip doth sorrow owe,<br/>

Which now in some slight measure it will pay,<br/>

If for his tender here I make some stay.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00300">Lie downe.</p>

<p id="id00301">  Ob. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite<br/>

And laid the loue iuyce on some true loues sight:<br/>

Of thy misprision, must perforce ensue<br/>

Some true loue turn'd, and not a false turn'd true<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00302">   Rob. Then fate ore-rules, that one man holding troth,<br/>

A million faile, confounding oath on oath<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00303">   Ob. About the wood, goe swifter then the winde,<br/>

And Helena of Athens looke thou finde.<br/>

All fancy sicke she is, and pale of cheere,<br/>

With sighes of loue, that costs the fresh bloud deare.<br/>

By some illusion see thou bring her heere,<br/>

Ile charme his eyes against she doth appeare<br/>

<p id="id00304">   Robin. I go, I go, looke how I goe,<br/>

Swifter then arrow from the Tartars bowe.<br/>

Hit with Cupids archery,<br/>

Sinke in apple of his eye,<br/>

When thou wak'st if she be by,<br/>

Beg of her for remedy.<br/>

Helena is heere at hand,<br/>

And the youth, mistooke by me,<br/>

Pleading for a Louers fee.<br/>

Shall we their fond Pageant see?<br/>

Lord, what fooles these mortals be!<br/>

  Ob. Stand aside: the noyse they make,<br/>

Will cause Demetrius to awake<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00307">   Puck. Then will two at once wooe one,<br/>

That must needs be sport alone:<br/>

And those things doe best please me,<br/>

That befall preposterously.<br/>

Enter Lysander and Helena.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00308">  Lys. Why should you think y I should wooe in scorn?<br/>

Scorne and derision neuer comes in teares:<br/>

Looke when I vow I weepe; and vowes so borne,<br/>

In their natiuity all truth appeares.<br/>

How can these things in me, seeme scorne to you?<br/>

Bearing the badge of faith to proue them true<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00309">   Hel. You doe aduance your cunning more &amp; more,<br/>

When truth kils truth, O diuelish holy fray!<br/>

These vowes are Hermias. Will you giue her ore?<br/>

Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.<br/>

Your vowes to her, and me, (put in two scales)<br/>

Will euen weigh, and both as light as tales<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00310">   Lys. I had no iudgement, when to her I swore</p>

<p id="id00311">   Hel. Nor none in my minde, now you giue her ore</p>

<p id="id00312">   Lys. Demetrius loues her, and he loues not you.</p>

<p id="id00313">Awa.</p>

<p id="id00314">  Dem. O Helen, goddesse, nimph, perfect, diuine,<br/>

To what, my loue, shall I compare thine eyne!<br/>

Christall is muddy, O how ripe in show,<br/>

Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!<br/>

That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,<br/>

Fan'd with the Easterne winde, turnes to a crow,<br/>

When thou holdst vp thy hand. O let me kisse<br/>

This Princesse of pure white, this seale of blisse<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00315">   Hell. O spight! O hell! I see you are all bent<br/>

To set against me, for your merriment:<br/>

If you were ciuill, and knew curtesie,<br/>

You would not doe me thus much iniury.<br/>

Can you not hate me, as I know you doe,<br/>

But you must ioyne in soules to mocke me to?<br/>

If you are men, as men you are in show,<br/>

You would not vse a gentle Lady so;<br/>

To vow, and sweare, and superpraise my parts,<br/>

When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.<br/>

You both are Riuals, and loue Hermia;<br/>

And now both Riuals to mocke Helena.<br/>

A trim exploit, a manly enterprize,<br/>

To coniure teares vp in a poore maids eyes,<br/>

With your derision; none of noble sort,<br/>

Would so offend a Virgin, and extort<br/>

A poore soules patience, all to make you sport,<br/>

  Lysa. You are vnkind Demetrius; be not so,<br/>

For you loue Hermia; this you know I know;<br/>

And here with all good will, with all my heart,<br/>

In Hermias loue I yeeld you vp my part;<br/>

And yours of Helena, To me bequeath,<br/>

Whom I do loue, and will do to my death<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00316">   Hel. Neuer did mockers wast more idle breth</p>

<p id="id00317">   Dem. Lysander, keep thy Hermia, I will none:<br/>

If ere I lou'd her, all that loue is gone.<br/>

My heart to her, but as guest-wise soiourn'd,<br/>

And now to Helen it is home return'd,<br/>

There to remaine<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00318">   Lys. It is not so</p>

<p id="id00319">   De. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,<br/>

Lest to thy perill thou abide it deare.<br/>

Looke where thy Loue comes, yonder is thy deare.<br/>

Enter Hermia.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00320">  Her. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,<br/>

The eare more quicke of apprehension makes,<br/>

Wherein it doth impaire the seeing sense,<br/>

It paies the hearing double recompence.<br/>

Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander found,<br/>

Mine eare (I thanke it) brought me to that sound.<br/>

But why vnkindly didst thou leaue me so?<br/>

  Lysan. Why should hee stay whom Loue doth presse to go?<br/>

  Her. What loue could presse Lysander from my side?<br/>

  Lys. Lysanders loue (that would not let him bide)<br/>

Faire Helena; who more engilds the night,<br/>

Then all yon fierie oes, and eies of light.<br/>

Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know,<br/>

The hate I bare thee, made me leaue thee so?<br/>

  Her. You speake not as you thinke; it cannot be<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00321">   Hel. Loe, she is one of this confederacy,<br/>

Now I perceiue they haue conioyn'd all three,<br/>

To fashion this false sport in spight of me.<br/>

Iniurous Hermia, most vngratefull maid,<br/>

Haue you conspir'd, haue you with these contriu'd<br/>

To baite me, with this foule derision?<br/>

Is all the counsell that we two haue shar'd,<br/>

The sisters vowes, the houres that we haue spent,<br/>

When wee haue chid the hasty footed time,<br/>

For parting vs; O, is all forgot?<br/>

All schooledaies friendship, child-hood innocence?<br/>

We Hermia, like two Artificiall gods,<br/>

Haue with our needles, created both one flower,<br/>

Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,<br/>

Both warbling of one song, both in one key:<br/>

As if our hands, our sides, voices, and mindes<br/>

Had beene incorporate. So we grew together,<br/>

Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,<br/>

But yet a vnion in partition,<br/>

Two louely berries molded on one stem,<br/>

So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,<br/>

Two of the first life coats in Heraldry,<br/>

Due but to one and crowned with one crest.<br/>

And will you rent our ancient loue asunder,<br/>

To ioyne with men in scorning your poore friend?<br/>

It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly.<br/>

Our sexe as well as I, may chide you for it,<br/>

Though I alone doe feele the iniurie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00322">   Her. I am amazed at your passionate words,<br/>

I scorne you not; It seemes that you scorne me<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00323">   Hel. Haue you not set Lysander, as in scorne<br/>

To follow me, and praise my eies and face?<br/>

And made your other loue, Demetrius<br/>

(Who euen but now did spurne me with his foote)<br/>

To call me goddesse, nimph, diuine, and rare,<br/>

Precious, celestiall? Wherefore speakes he this<br/>

To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander<br/>

Denie your loue (so rich within his soule)<br/>

And tender me (forsooth) affection,<br/>

But by your setting on, by your consent?<br/>

What though I be not so in grace as you,<br/>

So hung vpon with loue, so fortunate?<br/>

(But miserable most, to loue vnlou'd)<br/>

This you should pittie, rather then despise<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00324">   Her. I vnderstand not what you meane by this</p>

<p id="id00325">   Hel. I, doe, perseuer, counterfeit sad lookes,<br/>

Make mouthes vpon me when I turne my backe,<br/>

Winke each at other, hold the sweete iest vp:<br/>

This sport well carried, shall be chronicled.<br/>

If you haue any pittie, grace, or manners,<br/>

You would not make me such an argument:<br/>

But fare ye well, 'tis partly mine owne fault,<br/>

Which death or absence soone shall remedie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00326">   Lys. Stay gentle Helena, heare my excuse,<br/>

My loue, my life, my soule, faire Helena<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00327">   Hel. O excellent!<br/>

  Her. Sweete, do not scorne her so<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00328">   Dem. If she cannot entreate, I can compell</p>

<p id="id00329">   Lys. Thou canst compell, no more then she entreate.<br/>

Thy threats haue no more strength then her weak praise.<br/>

Helen, I loue thee, by my life I doe;<br/>

I sweare by that which I will lose for thee,<br/>

To proue him false, that saies I loue thee not<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00330">   Dem. I say, I loue thee more then he can do</p>

<p id="id00331">   Lys. If thou say so, withdraw and proue it too</p>

<p id="id00332">   Dem. Quick, come</p>

<p id="id00333">   Her. Lysander, whereto tends all this?<br/>

  Lys. Away, you Ethiope<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00334">   Dem. No, no, Sir, seeme to breake loose;<br/>

Take on as you would follow,<br/>

But yet come not: you are a tame man, go<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00335">   Lys. Hang off thou cat, thou bur; vile thing let loose,<br/>

Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00336">   Her. Why are you growne so rude?<br/>

What change is this sweete Loue?<br/>

  Lys. Thy loue? out tawny Tartar, out;<br/>

Out loathed medicine; O hated poison hence<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00337">   Her. Do you not iest?<br/>

  Hel. Yes sooth, and so do you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00338">   Lys. Demetrius: I will keepe my word with thee</p>

<p id="id00339">   Dem. I would I had your bond: for I perceiue<br/>

A weake bond holds you; Ile not trust your word<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00340">   Lys. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?<br/>

Although I hate her, Ile not harme her so<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00341">   Her. What, can you do me greater harme then hate?<br/>

Hate me, wherefore? O me, what newes my Loue?<br/>

Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?<br/>

I am as faire now, as I was ere while.<br/>

Since night you lou'd me: yet since night you left me.<br/>

Why then you left me (O the gods forbid)<br/>

In earnest, shall I say?<br/>

  Lys. I, by my life;<br/>

And neuer did desire to see thee more.<br/>

Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;<br/>

Be certaine, nothing truer: 'tis no iest,<br/>

That I do hate thee, and loue Helena<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00342">   Her. O me, you iugler, you canker blossome,<br/>

You theefe of loue; What, haue you come by night,<br/>

And stolne my loues heart from him?<br/>

  Hel. Fine yfaith:<br/>

Haue you no modesty, no maiden shame,<br/>

No touch of bashfulnesse? What, will you teare<br/>

Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?<br/>

Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00343">   Her. Puppet? why so? I, that way goes the game.<br/>

Now I perceiue that she hath made compare<br/>

Betweene our statures, she hath vrg'd her height,<br/>

And with her personage, her tall personage,<br/>

Her height (forsooth) she hath preuail'd with him.<br/>

And are you growne so high in his esteeme,<br/>

Because I am so dwarfish, and so low?<br/>

How low am I, thou painted May-pole? Speake,<br/>

How low am I? I am not yet so low,<br/>

But that my nailes can reach vnto thine eyes<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00344">   Hel. I pray you though you mocke me, gentlemen,<br/>

Let her not hurt me; I was neuer curst:<br/>

I haue no gift at all in shrewishnesse;<br/>

I am a right maide for my cowardize;<br/>

Let her not strike me: you perhaps may thinke,<br/>

Because she is something lower then my selfe,<br/>

That I can match her<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00345">   Her. Lower? harke againe</p>

<p id="id00346">   Hel. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me,<br/>

I euermore did loue you Hermia,<br/>

Did euer keepe your counsels, neuer wronged you,<br/>

Saue that in loue vnto Demetrius,<br/>

I told him of your stealth vnto this wood.<br/>

He followed you, for loue I followed him,<br/>

But he hath chid me hence, and threatned me<br/>

To strike me, spurne me, nay to kill me too;<br/>

And now, so you will let me quiet go,<br/>

To Athens will I beare my folly backe,<br/>

And follow you no further. Let me go.<br/>

You see how simple, and how fond I am<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00347">   Her. Why get you gone: who ist that hinders you?<br/>

  Hel. A foolish heart, that I leaue here behinde<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00348">   Her. What, with Lysander?<br/>

  Her. With Demetrius<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00349">   Lys. Be not afraid, she shall not harme thee Helena</p>

<p id="id00350">   Dem. No sir, she shall not, though you take her part</p>

<p id="id00351">   Hel. O when she's angry, she is keene and shrewd,<br/>

She was a vixen when she went to schoole,<br/>

And though she be but little, she is fierce<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00352">   Her. Little againe? Nothing but low and little?<br/>

Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?<br/>

Let me come to her<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00353">   Lys. Get you gone you dwarfe,<br/>

You minimus, of hindring knot-grasse made,<br/>

You bead, you acorne<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00354">   Dem. You are too officious,<br/>

In her behalfe that scornes your seruices.<br/>

Let her alone, speake not of Helena,<br/>

Take not her part. For if thou dost intend<br/>

Neuer so little shew of loue to her,<br/>

Thou shalt abide it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00355">   Lys. Now she holds me not,<br/>

Now follow if thou dar'st, to try whose right,<br/>

Of thine or mine is most in Helena<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00356">   Dem. Follow? Nay, Ile goe with thee cheeke by<br/>

iowle.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00357">Exit Lysander and Demetrius.</p>

<p id="id00358">  Her. You Mistris, all this coyle is long of you.<br/>

Nay, goe not backe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00359">   Hel. I will not trust you I,<br/>

Nor longer stay in your curst companie.<br/>

Your hands then mine, are quicker for a fray,<br/>

My legs are longer though to runne away.<br/>

Enter Oberon and Pucke.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00360">  Ob. This is thy negligence, still thou mistak'st,<br/>

Or else committ'st thy knaueries willingly<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00361">   Puck. Beleeue me, King of shadowes, I mistooke,<br/>

Did not you tell me, I should know the man,<br/>

By the Athenian garments he hath on?<br/>

And so farre blamelesse proues my enterprize,<br/>

That I haue nointed an Athenians eies,<br/>

And so farre am I glad, it so did sort,<br/>

<p id="id00362">   Ob. Thou seest these Louers seeke a place to fight,<br/>

Hie therefore Robin, ouercast the night,<br/>

The starrie Welkin couer thou anon,<br/>

With drooping fogge as blacke as Acheron,<br/>

And lead these testie Riuals so astray,<br/>

As one come not within anothers way.<br/>

Like to Lysander, sometime frame thy tongue,<br/>

Then stirre Demetrius vp with bitter wrong;<br/>

And sometime raile thou like Demetrius;<br/>

And from each other looke thou leade them thus,<br/>

Till ore their browes, death-counterfeiting, sleepe<br/>

With leaden legs, and Battie-wings doth creepe:<br/>

Then crush this hearbe into Lysanders eie,<br/>

Whose liquor hath this vertuous propertie,<br/>

To take from thence all error, with his might,<br/>

and make his eie-bals role with wonted sight.<br/>

When they next wake, all this derision<br/>

Shall seeme a dreame, and fruitless vision,<br/>

And backe to Athens shall the Louers wend<br/>

With league, whose date till death shall neuer end.<br/>

For she his hairy temples then had rounded,<br/>

With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers.<br/>

And that same dew which somtime on the buds,<br/>

Was wont to swell like round and orient pearles;<br/>

Stood now within the pretty flouriets eyes,<br/>

Like teares that did their owne disgrace bewaile.<br/>

When I had at my pleasure taunted her,<br/>

Which straight she gaue me, and her fairy sent<br/>

When in a wood of Creete they bayed the Beare<br/>

With hounds of Sparta; neuer did I heare<br/>

Such gallant chiding. For besides the groues,<br/>

The skies, the fountaines, euery region neere,<br/>

Seeme all one mutuall cry. I neuer heard<br/>

So musicall a discord, such sweet thunder<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00419">   Thes. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kinde,<br/>

So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung<br/>

With eares that sweepe away the morning dew,<br/>

Crooke kneed, and dew-lapt, like Thessalian Buls,<br/>

Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bels,<br/>

Each vnder each. A cry more tuneable<br/>

Was neuer hallowed to, nor cheer'd with horne,<br/>

In Creete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly;<br/>

Iudge when you heare. But soft, what nimphs are these?<br/>

  Egeus. My Lord, this is my daughter heere asleepe,<br/>

How comes this gentle concord in the world,<br/>

That hatred is so farre from iealousie,<br/>

To sleepe by hate, and feare no enmity<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00426">   Lys. My Lord, I shall reply amazedly,<br/>

Halfe sleepe, halfe waking. but as yet, I sweare,<br/>

I cannot truly say how I came heere.<br/>

But as I thinke (for truly would I speake)<br/>

And now I doe bethinke me, so it is;<br/>

I came with Hermia hither. Our intent<br/>

Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be<br/>

Without the perill of the Athenian Law<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00427">   Ege. Enough, enough, my Lord: you haue enough;<br/>

I beg the Law, the Law, vpon his head:<br/>

They would have stolne away, they would Demetrius,<br/>

Thereby to haue defeated you and me:<br/>

You of your wife, and me of my consent;<br/>

Of my consent, that she should be your wife<br/>

<p id="id00428">   Dem. My Lord, faire Helen told me of their stealth,<br/>

Of this their purpose hither, to this wood,<br/>

And I in furie hither followed them;<br/>

Faire Helena, in fancy followed me.<br/>

But my good Lord, I wot not by what not by what power,<br/>

(But by some power it is) my loue<br/>

To Hermia (melted as the snow)<br/>

Seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude,<br/>

Which in my childehood I did doat vpon:<br/>

And all the faith, the vertue of my heart,<br/>

The obiect and the pleasure of mine eye,<br/>

Is onely Helena. To her, my Lord,<br/>

Was I betroth'd, ere I see Hermia,<br/>

But like a sickenesse did I loath this food,<br/>

But as in health, come to my naturall taste,<br/>

Now doe I wish it, loue it, long for it,<br/>

And will for euermore be true to it<br/>

Of this discourse we shall heare more anon.<br/>

These couples shall eternally be knit.<br/>

And for the morning now is something worne,<br/>

Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.<br/>

Away, with vs to Athens; three and three,<br/>

Wee'll hold a feast in great solemnitie.<br/>

Gods my life! Stolne hence, and left me asleepe: I
haue had a most rare vision. I had a dreame, past the wit
of man, to say, what dreame it was. Man is but an Asse,
if he goe about to expound this dreame. Me-thought I
was, there is no man can tell what. Me-thought I was,
and me-thought I had. But man is but a patch'd foole,
if he will offer to say, what me-thought I had. The eye of
man hath not heard, the eare of man hath not seen, mans
hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceiue, nor his
heart to report, what my dreame was. I will get Peter
Quince to write a ballet of this dreame, it shall be called
Bottomes Dreame, because it hath no bottome; and I will
sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peraduenture,
to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it
at her death.

In any case let Thisby haue cleane linnen: and let not him

</p>

<p id="id00466">   The. That is some Satire keene and criticall,<br/>

Not sorting with a nuptiall ceremonie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00467">   Lis. A tedious breefe Scene of yong Piramus,<br/>

And his loue Thisby; very tragicall mirth<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00468">   The. Merry and tragicall? Tedious, and briefe? That<br/>

is, hot ice, and wondrous strange snow. How shall wee<br/>

finde the concord of this discord?<br/>

  Ege. A play there is, my Lord, some ten words long,<br/>

Which is as breefe, as I haue knowne a play;<br/>

But by ten words, my Lord, it is too long;<br/>

Which makes it tedious. For in all the play,<br/>

There is not one word apt, one Player fitted.<br/>

And tragicall my noble Lord it is: for Piramus<br/>

Therein doth kill himselfe. Which when I saw<br/>

Rehearst, I must confesse, made mine eyes water:<br/>

But more merrie teares, the passion of loud laughter<br/>

Neuer shed<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00469">   Thes. What are they that do play it?<br/>

  Ege. Hard handed men, that worke in Athens heere,<br/>

Which neuer labour'd in their mindes till now;<br/>

And now haue toyled their vnbreathed memories<br/>

With this same play, against your nuptiall<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00470">   The. And we will heare it</p>

<p id="id00471">   Hip. No my noble Lord, it is not for you. I haue heard<br/>

It ouer, and it is nothing, nothing in the world;<br/>

Vnless you can finde sport in their intents,<br/>

Extreamely stretched, and cond with cruell paine,<br/>

To doe you seruice<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00472">   Thes. I will heare that play. For neuer any thing<br/>

Can be amisse, when simplenesse and duty tender it.<br/>

Goe bring them in, and take your places, Ladies<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00473">   Hip. I loue not to see wretchednesse orecharged;<br/>

And duty in his seruice perishing<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00474">   Thes. Why gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing</p>

<p id="id00475">   Hip. He saies, they can doe nothing in this kinde</p>

<p id="id00476">   Thes. The kinder we, to giue them thanks for nothing<br/>

Our sport shall be, to take what they mistake;<br/>

And what poore duty cannot doe, noble respect<br/>

Takes it in might, not merit.<br/>

Where I haue come, great Clearkes haue purposed<br/>

To greete me with premeditated welcomes;<br/>

Where I haue seene them shiuer and looke pale,<br/>

Make periods in the midst of sentences,<br/>

Throttle their practiz'd accent in their feares,<br/>

And in conclusion, dumbly haue broke off,<br/>

Not paying me a welcome. Trust me sweete,<br/>

Out of this silence yet, I pickt a welcome:<br/>

And in the modesty of fearefull duty,<br/>

I read as much, as from the ratling tongue<br/>

Of saucy and audacious eloquence.<br/>

Loue therefore, and tongue-tide simplicity,<br/>

In least, speake most, to my capacity<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00477">   Egeus. So please your Grace, the Prologue is addrest</p>

<p id="id00478">   Duke. Let him approach.</p>

<p id="id00479">Flor. Trum.</p>

<p id="id00480">Enter the Prologue. Quince.</p>

<p id="id00481">  Pro. If we offend, it is with our good will.<br/>

That you should thinke, we come not to offend,<br/>

But with good will. To shew our simple skill,<br/>

That is the true beginning of our end.<br/>

Consider then, we come but in despight.<br/>

We do not come, as minding to content you,<br/>

Our true intent is. All for your delight,<br/>

We are not heere. That you should here repent you,<br/>

The Actors are at hand; and by their show,<br/>

You shall know all, that you are like to know<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00482">   Thes. This fellow doth not stand vpon points</p>

<p id="id00483">   Lys. He hath rid his Prologue, like a rough Colt: he
knowes not the stop. A good morall my lord. it is not
enough to speake, but to speake true</p>

<p id="id00484">   Hip. Indeed hee hath plaid on his Prologue, like a<br/>

childe on a Recorder, a sound, but not in gouernment<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00485">   Thes. His speech was like a tangled chaine: nothing<br/>

impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00486">Tawyer with a Trumpet before them.</p>

<p id="id00487">Enter Pyramus and Thisby, Wall, Moone-shine, and Lyon.</p>

<p id="id00488">  Prol. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show,<br/>

But wonder on, till truth make all things plaine.<br/>

This man is Piramus, if you would know;<br/>

This beauteous Lady, Thisby is certaine.<br/>

This man, with lyme and rough-cast, doth present<br/>

Wall, that vile wall, which did these louers sunder:<br/>

And through walls chink (poor soules) they are content<br/>

To whisper. At the which, let no man wonder.<br/>

This man, with Lanthorne, dog, and bush of thorne,<br/>

Presenteth moone-shine. For if you will know,<br/>

By moone-shine did these Louers thinke no scorne<br/>

To meet at Ninus toombe, there, there to wooe:<br/>

This grizly beast (which Lyon hight by name)<br/>

The trusty Thisby, comming first by night,<br/>

Did scarre away, or rather did affright:<br/>

And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;<br/>

Which Lyon vile with bloody mouth did staine.<br/>

Anon comes Piramus, sweet youth and tall,<br/>

And findes his Thisbies Mantle slaine;<br/>

Whereat, with blade, with bloody blamefull blade,<br/>

He brauely broacht his boiling bloudy breast,<br/>

And Thisby, tarrying in Mulberry shade,<br/>

His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,<br/>

Let Lyon, Moone-shine, Wall, and Louers twaine,<br/>

At large discourse, while here they doe remaine.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00489">Exit all but Wall.</p>

<p id="id00490">  Thes. I wonder if the Lion be to speake</p>

<p id="id00491" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Deme. No wonder, my Lord: one Lion may, when
many Asses doe.</p>

<p id="id00492">Exit Lyon, Thisbie, and Mooneshine.</p>

<p id="id00493">  Wall. In this same Interlude, it doth befall,<br/>

That I, one Snowt (by name) present a wall:<br/>

And such a wall, as I would haue you thinke,<br/>

That had in it a crannied hole or chinke:<br/>

Through which the Louers, Piramus and Thisbie<br/>

Did whisper often, very secretly.<br/>

This loame, this rough-cast, and this stone doth shew,<br/>

That I am that same Wall; the truth is so.<br/>

And this the cranny is, right and sinister,<br/>

Through which the fearfull Louers are to whisper<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00494">   Thes. Would you desire Lime and Haire to speake<br/>

better?<br/>

  Deme. It is the wittiest partition, that euer I heard<br/>

discourse, my Lord<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00495">   Thes. Pyramus drawes neere the Wall, silence.<br/>

Enter Pyramus.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00496">  Pir. O grim lookt night, o night with hue so blacke,<br/>

O night, which euer art, when day is not:<br/>

O night, o night, alacke, alacke, alacke,<br/>

I feare my Thisbies promise is forgot.<br/>

And thou o wall, thou sweet and louely wall,<br/>

That stands between her fathers ground and mine,<br/>

Thou wall, o Wall, o sweet and louely wall,<br/>

Shew me thy chinke, to blinke through with mine eine.<br/>

Thankes courteous wall. Ioue shield thee well for this.<br/>

But what see I? No Thisbie doe I see.<br/>

O wicked wall, through whom I see no blisse,<br/>

Curst be thy stones for thus deceiuing mee<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00497">   Thes. The wall me-thinkes being sensible, should<br/>

curse againe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00498">   Pir. No in truth sir, he should not. Deceiuing me,<br/>

Is Thisbies cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy<br/>

Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall.<br/>

Enter Thisbie.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00499">Pat as I told you; yonder she comes</p>

<p id="id00500">   This. O wall, full often hast thou heard my mones,<br/>

For parting my faire Piramus, and me<br/>

My cherry lips haue often kist thy stones;<br/>

Thy stones with Lime and Haire knit vp in thee<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00501">   Pyra. I see a voyce; now will I to the chinke,<br/>

To spy and I can heare my Thisbies face. Thisbie?<br/>

  This. My Loue thou art, my Loue I thinke<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00502">   Pir. Thinke what thou wilt, I am thy Louers grace,<br/>

And like Limander am I trusty still<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00503">   This. And like Helen till the Fates me kill</p>

<p id="id00504">   Pir. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true</p>

<p id="id00505">   This. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you</p>

<p id="id00506">   Pir. O kisse me through the hole of this vile wall</p>

<p id="id00507">   This. I kisse the wals hole, not your lips at all</p>

<p id="id00508">   Pir. Wilt thou at Ninnies tombe meete me straight<br/>

way?<br/>

  This. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00509">   Wall. Thus haue I Wall, my part discharged so;<br/>

And being done, thus Wall away doth go.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00510">Exit Clow.</p>

<p id="id00511">  Du. Now is the morall downe between the two<br/>

Neighbours<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00512">   Dem. No remedie my Lord, when Wals are so wilfull,<br/>

to heare without warning<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00513">   Dut. This is the silliest stuffe that ere I heard</p>

<p id="id00514" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Du. The best in this kind are but shadowes, and the
worst are no worse, if imagination amend them</p>

<p id="id00515">   Dut. It must be your imagination then, &amp; not theirs</p>

<p id="id00516">   Duk. If wee imagine no worse of them then they of
themselues, they may passe for excellent men. Here com
two noble beasts, in a man and a Lion.
Enter Lyon and Moone-shine</p>

<p id="id00517">   Lyon. You Ladies, you (whose gentle harts do feare<br/>

The smallest monstrous mouse that creepes on floore)<br/>

May now perchance, both quake and tremble heere,<br/>

When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roare.<br/>

Then know that I, one Snug the Ioyner am<br/>

A Lion fell, nor else no Lions dam:<br/>

For if I should as Lion come in strife<br/>

Into this place, 'twere pittie of my life<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00518">   Du. A verie gentle beast, and of good conscience</p>

<p id="id00519">   Dem. The verie best at a beast, my Lord, y ere I saw</p>

<p id="id00520">   Lis. This Lion is a verie Fox for his valor</p>

<p id="id00521">   Du. True, and a Goose for his discretion</p>

<p id="id00522" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Dem. Not so my Lord: for his valor cannot carrie
his discretion, and the fox carries the Goose</p>

<p id="id00523">   Du. His discretion I am sure cannot carrie his valor:
for the Goose carries not the Fox. It is well; leaue it to
his discretion, and let vs hearken to the Moone</p>

<p id="id00524">   Moone. This Lanthorne doth the horned Moone present</p>

<p id="id00525">   De. He should haue worne the hornes on his head</p>

<p id="id00526">   Du. Hee is no crescent, and his hornes are inuisible,<br/>

within the circumference<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00527">   Moon. This lanthorne doth the horned Moone present:<br/>

My selfe, the man i'th Moone doth seeme to be<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00528">   Du. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man<br/>

Should be put into the Lanthorne. How is it els the man<br/>

i'th Moone?<br/>

  Dem. He dares not come there for the candle.<br/>

For you see, it is already in snuffe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00529">   Dut. I am wearie of this Moone; would he would<br/>

change<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00530">   Du. It appeares by his smal light of discretion, that
he is in the wane: but yet in courtesie, in all reason, we
must stay the time</p>

<p id="id00531">   Lys. Proceed Moone</p>

<p id="id00532">   Moon. All that I haue to say, is to tell you, that the
Lanthorne is the Moone; I, the man in the Moone; this
thorne bush; my thorne bush; and this dog, my dog</p>

<p id="id00533">   Dem. Why all these should be in the Lanthorne: for
they are in the Moone. But silence, heere comes Thisby.
Enter Thisby.</p>

<p id="id00534">  This. This is old Ninnies tombe: where is my loue?<br/>

  Lyon. Oh.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00535">The Lion roares, Thisby runs off.</p>

<p id="id00536">  Dem. Well roar'd Lion</p>

<p id="id00537">   Du. Well run Thisby</p>

<p id="id00538">   Dut. Well shone Moone.<br/>

Truly the Moone shines with a good grace<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00539">   Du. Wel mouz'd Lion</p>

<p id="id00540">   Dem. And then came Piramus</p>

<p id="id00541">   Lys. And so the Lion vanisht.<br/>

Enter Piramus.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00542">  Pyr. Sweet Moone, I thank thee for thy sunny beames,<br/>

I thanke thee Moone, for shining now so bright:<br/>

For by thy gracious, golden, glittering beames,<br/>

I trust to taste of truest Thisbies sight.<br/>

But stay: O spight! but marke, poore Knight,<br/>

What dreadful dole is heere?<br/>

Eyes do you see! How can it be!<br/>

O dainty Ducke: O Deere!<br/>

Thy mantle good; what staind with blood!<br/>

Approch you furies fell:<br/>

O Fates! come, come: Cut thred and thrum,<br/>

Quaile, crush, conclude, and quell<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00543">   Du. This passion, and the death of a deare friend,<br/>

Would go neere to make a man looke sad<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00544">   Dut. Beshrew my heart, but I pittie the man</p>

<p id="id00545">   Pir. O wherefore Nature, did'st thou Lions frame?<br/>

Since lion vilde hath heere deflour'd my deere:<br/>

Which is: no, no, which was the fairest Dame<br/>

That liu'd, that lou'd, that like'd, that look'd with cheere.<br/>

Come teares, confound: Out sword, and wound<br/>

The pap of Piramus:<br/>

I, that left pap, where heart doth hop;<br/>

Thus dye I, thus, thus, thus.<br/>

Now am I dead, now am I fled, my soule is in the sky,<br/>

Tongue lose thy light, Moone take thy flight,<br/>

Now dye, dye, dye, dye, dye<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00546">   Dem. No Die, but an ace for him; for he is but one</p>

<p id="id00547">   Lis. Lesse then an ace man. For he is dead, he is nothing</p>

<p id="id00548">   Du. With the helpe of a Surgeon, he might yet recouer,<br/>

and proue an Asse<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00549">   Dut. How chance Moone-shine is gone before?<br/>

Thisby comes backe, and findes her Louer.<br/>

Enter Thisby.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00550">  Duke. She wil finde him by starre-light.<br/>

Heere she comes, and her passion ends the play<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00551">   Dut. Me thinkes shee should not vse a long one for<br/>

such a Piramus: I hope she will be breefe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00552">   Dem. A Moth wil turne the ballance, which Piramus<br/>

which Thisby is the better<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00553">   Lys. She hath spyed him already, with those sweete eyes</p>

<p id="id00554">   Dem. And thus she meanes, videlicit</p>

<p id="id00555">   This. Asleepe my Loue? What, dead my Doue?<br/>

O Piramus arise:<br/>

Speake, speake. Quite dumbe? Dead, dead? A tombe<br/>

Must couer thy sweet eyes.<br/>

These Lilly Lips, this cherry nose,<br/>

These yellow Cowslip cheekes<br/>

Are gone, are gone: Louers make mone:<br/>

His eyes were greene as Leekes.<br/>

O Sisters three, come, come to mee,<br/>

With hands as pale as Milke,<br/>

Lay them in gore, since you haue shore<br/>

with sheeres, his thred of silke.<br/>

Tongue not a word: Come trusty sword:<br/>

Come blade, my brest imbrue:<br/>

And farwell friends, thus Thisbie ends;<br/>

Adieu, adieu, adieu<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00556">   Duk. Moone-shine &amp; Lion are left to burie the dead</p>

<p id="id00557">   Deme. I, and Wall too</p>

<p id="id00558">   Bot. No, I assure you, the wall is downe, that parted
their Fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or
to heare a Bergomask dance, betweene two of our company?
  Duk. No Epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs
no excuse. Neuer excuse; for when the plaiers are all
dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if hee that
writ it had plaid Piramus, and hung himselfe in Thisbies
garter, it would haue beene a fine Tragedy: and so it is
truely, and very notably discharg'd. but come, your
Burgomaske; let your Epilogue alone.
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelue.
Louers to bed, 'tis almost Fairy time.
I feare we shall out-sleepe the comming morne,
As much as we this night haue ouer-watcht.
This palpable grosse play hath well beguil'd
The heauy gate of night. Sweet friends to bed.
A fortnight hold we this solemnity.
In nightly Reuels; and new iollitie.</p>
