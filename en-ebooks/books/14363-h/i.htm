<p><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a>This volume is a narrative of Scott's Last Expedition from
its departure from England in 1910 to its return to New
Zealand in 1913.</p>

<p>It does not, however, include the story of subsidiary
parties except where their adventures touch the history of
the Main Party.</p>

<p>It is hoped later to publish an appendix volume with
an account of the two Geological Journeys, and such
other information concerning the equipment of, and lessons
learned by, this Expedition as may be of use to the future
explorer.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This post-war business is inartistic, for it is seldom that
any one does anything well for the sake of doing it well;
and it is un-Christian, if you value Christianity, for men
are out to hurt and not to help&mdash;can you wonder, when the
Ten Commandments were hurled straight from the pulpit
through good stained glass. It is all very interesting and
uncomfortable, and it has been a great relief to wander
back in one's thoughts and correspondence and personal
dealings to an age in geological time, so many hundred
years ago, when we were artistic Christians, doing our jobs
as well as we were able just because we wished to do them
well, helping one another with all our strength, and (I
speak with personal humility) living a life of co-operation,
in the face of hardships and dangers, which has seldom
been surpassed.</p>

<p>The mutual conquest of difficulties is the cement of
friendship, as it is the only lasting cement of matrimony.
We had plenty of difficulties; we sometimes failed, we
sometimes won; we always faced them&mdash;we had to. Consequently
we have some friends who are better than all the
wives in Mahomet's paradise, and when I have asked for
help in the making of this book I have never never asked
in vain. Talk of ex-soldiers: give me ex-antarcticists, unsoured
and with their ideals intact: they could sweep the
world.</p>

<p>The trouble is that they are inclined to lose their ideals
<a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a>in this complicated atmosphere of civilization. They run
one another down like the deuce, and it is quite time that
stopped. What is the use of A running down Scott because
he served with Shackleton, or B going for Amundsen
because he served with Scott? They have all done good
work; within their limits, the best work to date. There
are jobs for which, if I had to do them, I would like to
serve under Scott, Amundsen, Shackleton and Wilson&mdash;each
to his part. For a joint scientific and geographical
piece of organization, give me Scott; for a Winter Journey,
Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen:
and if I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out
of it, give me Shackleton every time. They will all go
down in polar history as leaders, these men. I believe
Bowers would also have made a great name for himself if
he had lived, and few polar ships have been commanded as
capably as was the Terra Nova, by Pennell.</p>

<p>In a way this book is a sequel to the friendship which
there was between Wilson, Bowers and myself, which,
having stood the strain of the Winter Journey, could never
have been broken. Between the three of us we had a share
in all the big journeys and bad times which came to Scott's
main landing party, and what follows is, particularly, our
unpublished diaries, letters and illustrations. I, we, have
tried to show how good the whole thing was&mdash;and how
bad. I have had a freer hand than many in this, because
much of the dull routine has been recorded already and
can be found if wanted: also because, not being the leader
of the expedition, I had no duty to fulfil in cataloguing my
followers' achievements. But there was plenty of work left
for me. It has been no mere gleaning of the polar field.
Not half the story had been told, nor even all the most
interesting documents. Among these, I have had from
Mrs. Bowers her son's letters home, and from Lashly his
<a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a>diary of the Last Return Party on the Polar Journey. Mrs.
Wilson has given her husband's diary of the Polar Journey:
this is especially valuable because it is the only detailed
account in existence from 87&deg; 32&acute; to the Pole
and after, with the exception of Scott's Diary already published.
Lady Scott has given with both hands any records
I wanted and could find. No one of my companions in the
South has failed to help. They include Atkinson, Wright,
Priestley, Simpson, Lillie and Debenham.</p>

<p>To all these good friends I can do no more than express
my very sincere thanks.</p>

<p>I determined that the first object of the illustrations
should be descriptive of the text: Wright and Debenham
have photographs, sledging and otherwise, which do this
admirably. Mrs. Wilson has allowed me to have any of
her husband's sketches and drawings reproduced that I
wished, and there are many hundreds from which to make
a selection. In addition to the six water-colours, which I
have chosen for their beauty, I have taken a number of
sketches because they illustrate typical incidents in our
lives. They are just unfinished sketches, no more: and
had Bill been alive he would have finished them before he
allowed them to be published. Then I have had reproduced
nearly all the sketches and panoramas drawn by him on
the Polar Journey and found with him where he died. The
half-tone process does not do them justice: I wish I could
have had them reproduced in photogravure, but the cost is
prohibitive.</p>

<p>As to production, after a good deal of experience, I was
convinced that I could trust a commercial firm to do its
worst save when it gave them less trouble to do better. I
acknowledge my mistake. In a wilderness of firms in whom
nothing was first class except their names and their prices, I
have dealt with R. &amp; R. Clark, who have printed this book,
<a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a>and Emery Walker, who has illustrated it. The fact that
Emery Walker is not only alive, but full of vitality, indicates
why most of the other firms are millionaires.</p>

<p>When I went South I never meant to write a book: I
rather despised those who did so as being of an inferior
brand to those who did things and said nothing about
them. But that they say nothing is too often due to the
fact that they have nothing to say, or are too idle or too
busy to learn how to say it. Every one who has been
through such an extraordinary experience has much to say,
and ought to say it if he has any faculty that way. There
is after the event a good deal of criticism, of stock-taking,
of checking of supplies and distances and so forth that
cannot really be done without first-hand experience. Out
there we knew what was happening to us too well; but
we did not and could not measure its full significance.
When I was asked to write a book by the Antarctic Committee
I discovered that, without knowing it, I had intended
to write one ever since I had realized my own experiences.
Once started, I enjoyed the process. My own
writing is my own despair, but it is better than it was, and
this is directly due to Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Shaw. At the
age of thirty-five I am delighted to acknowledge that my
education has at last begun.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated
way of having a bad time which has been devised. It
is the only form of adventure in which you put on your
clothes at Michaelmas and keep them on until Christmas,
and, save for a layer of the natural grease of the body,
find them as clean as though they were new. It is more
lonely than London, more secluded than any monastery,
and the post comes but once a year. As men will compare
the hardships of France, Palestine, or Mesopotamia, so it
would be interesting to contrast the rival claims of the
Antarctic as a medium of discomfort. A member of Campbell's
party tells me that the trenches at Ypres were a comparative
picnic. But until somebody can evolve a standard
of endurance I am unable to see how it can be done. Take
it all in all, I do not believe anybody on earth has a worse
time than an Emperor penguin.</p>

<p>Even now the Antarctic is to the rest of the earth as the
Abode of the Gods was to the ancient Chaldees, a precipitous
and mammoth land lying far beyond the seas which
encircled man's habitation, and nothing is more striking
about the exploration of the Southern Polar regions than
its absence, for when King Alfred reigned in England the
Vikings were navigating the ice-fields of the North; yet
when Wellington fought the battle of Waterloo there was
still an undiscovered continent in the South.</p>

<p>For those who wish to read an account of the history
of Antarctic exploration there is an excellent chapter in
Scott's Voyage of the Discovery and elsewhere. I do not
propose to give any general survey of this kind here, but
<a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii"></a>complaints have been made to me that Scott's Last Expedition
plunges the general reader into a neighbourhood
which he is supposed to know all about, while actually he
is lost, having no idea what the Discovery was, or where
Castle Rock or Hut Point stand. For the better understanding
of the references to particular expeditions, to the
lands discovered by them and the traces left by them,
which must occur in this book I give the following brief
introduction.</p>

<p>From the earliest days of the making of maps of the
Southern Hemisphere it was supposed that there was a
great continent called Terra Australis. As explorers penetrated
round the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn, and
found nothing but stormy oceans beyond, and as, later,
they discovered Australia and New Zealand, the belief in
this continent weakened, but was not abandoned. During
the latter half of the eighteenth century eagerness for
scientific knowledge was added to the former striving after
individual or State aggrandizement.</p>

<p>Cook, Ross and Scott: these are the aristocrats of the
South.</p>

<p>It was the great English navigator James Cook who
laid the foundations of our knowledge. In 1772 he sailed
from Deptford in the Resolution, 462 tons, and the Adventure,
336 tons, ships which had been built at Whitby
for the coal trade. He was, like Nansen, a believer in a
varied diet as one of the preventives of scurvy, and mentions
that he had among his provisions &quot;besides Saur
Krout, Portable Broth, Marmalade of Carrots and Suspissated
juice of Wort and Beer.&quot; Medals were struck &quot;to
be given to the natives of new discovered countries, and left
there as testimonies of our being the first discoverers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It would be interesting to know whether any exist now.</p>

<p>After calling at the Cape of Good Hope Cook started
to make his Easting down to New Zealand, purposing to
sail as far south as possible in search of a southern continent.
He sighted his first 'ice island' or iceberg in
lat. 50&deg; 40&acute; S., long. 2&deg; 0&acute; E., on December 10, 1772.<a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix"></a>
The next day he &quot;saw some white birds about the size of
pigeons, with blackish bills and feet. I never saw any such
before.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> These must have been Snowy Petrel. Passing
through many bergs, where he notices how the albatross
left them and penguins appeared, he was brought up by
thick pack ice along which he coasted. Under the supposition
that this ice was formed in bays and rivers Cook
was led to believe that land was not far distant. Incidentally
he remarks that in order to enable his men to support
the colder weather he &quot;caused the sleeves of their
jackets (which were so short as to expose their arms) to be
lengthened with baize; and had a cap made for each man
of the same stuff, together with canvas; which proved of
great service to them.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>For more than a month Cook sailed the Southern Ocean,
always among bergs and often among pack. The weather
was consistently bad and generally thick; he mentions
that he had only seen the moon once since leaving the
Cape.</p>

<p>It was on Sunday, January 17, 1773, that the Antarctic
Circle was crossed for the first time, in longitude 39&deg; 35&acute;
E. After proceeding to latitude 67&deg; 15&acute; S. he was stopped
by an immense field of pack. From this point he turned
back and made his way to New Zealand.</p>

<p>Leaving New Zealand at the end of 1773 without his
second ship, the Adventure, from which he had been
parted, he judged from the great swell that &quot;there can be
no land to the southward, under the meridian of New Zealand,
but what must lie very far to the south.&quot; In latitude
62&deg; 10&acute; S. he sighted the first ice island on December 12,
and was stopped by thick pack ice three days later. On the
20th he again crossed the Antarctic Circle in longitude
147&deg; 46&acute; W. and penetrated in this neighbourhood to a latitude
of 67&deg; 31&acute; S. Here he found a drift towards the
north-east.</p>

<p>On January 26, 1774, in longitude 109&deg; 31&acute; W., he
crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time, after meeting
no pack and only a few icebergs. In latitude 71&deg; 10&acute; S. he
<a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx"></a>was finally turned back by an immense field of pack, and
wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;I will not say it was impossible anywhere to get farther
to the south; but the attempting it would have been
a dangerous and rash enterprise, and what, I believe, no
man in my situation would have thought of. It was, indeed,
my opinion, as well as the opinion of most on board, that
this ice extended quite to the Pole, or perhaps joined to
some land, to which it had been fixed from the earliest
time; and that it is here, that is to the south of this parallel,
where all the ice we find scattered up and down to the
north is first formed, and afterwards broken off by gales of
wind, or other causes, and brought to the north by the currents,
which are always found to set in that direction in the
high latitudes. As we drew near this ice some penguins
were heard, but none seen; and but few other birds, or
any other thing that could induce us to think any land was
near. And yet I think there must be some to the south beyond
this ice; but if there is it can afford no better retreat
for birds, or any other animals, than the ice itself, with
which it must be wholly covered. I, who had ambition not
only to go farther than any one had been before, but as far
as it was possible for man to go, was not sorry at meeting
with this interruption; as it, in some measure, relieved us;
at least, shortened the dangers and hardships inseparable
from the navigation of the Southern Polar regions.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>And so he turned northwards, when, being &quot;taken ill of
the bilious colic,&quot; a favourite dog belonging to one of the
officers (Mr. Forster, after whom Aptenodytes forsteri, the
Emperor penguin, is named) &quot;fell a sacrifice to my tender
stomach.... Thus I received nourishment and strength,
from food which would have made most people in Europe
sick: so true it is that necessity is governed by no law.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>&quot;Once and for all the idea of a populous fertile southern
continent was proved to be a myth, and it was clearly shown
that whatever land might exist to the South must be a
region of desolation hidden beneath a mantle of ice and
snow. The vast extent of the tempestuous southern seas
<a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi"></a>was revealed, and the limits of the habitable globe were
made known. Incidentally it may be remarked that Cook
was the first to describe the peculiarities of the Antarctic
icebergs and floe-ice.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>A Russian expedition under Bellingshausen discovered
the first certain land in the Antarctic in 1819, and called it
Alexander Land, which lies nearly due south of Cape Horn.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the rule in other parts of the
world, the flag followed trade in the southern seas during
the first part of the nineteenth century. The discovery of
large numbers of seals and whales attracted many hundreds
of ships, and it is to the enlightened instructions of such
firms as Messrs. Enderby, and to the pluck and enterprise
of such commanders as Weddell, Biscoe and Balleny, that
we owe much of our small knowledge of the outline of the
Antarctic continent.</p>

<p>&quot;In the smallest and craziest ships they plunged boldly
into stormy ice-strewn seas; again and again they narrowly
missed disaster; their vessels were racked and
strained and leaked badly, their crews were worn out with
unceasing toil and decimated with scurvy. Yet in spite of
inconceivable discomforts they struggled on, and it does
not appear that any one of them ever turned his course
until he was driven to do so by hard necessity. One cannot
read the simple, unaffected narratives of these voyages
without being assured of their veracity, and without being
struck by the wonderful pertinacity and courage which
they display.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The position in 1840 was that the Antarctic land had
been sighted at a few points all round its coasts. On the
whole the boundaries which had been seen lay on or close
to the Antarctic Circle, and it appeared probable that the
continent, if continent it was, consisted of a great circular
mass of land with the South Pole at its centre, and its coasts
more or less equidistant from this point.</p>

<p>Two exceptions only to this had been found. Cook and
Bellingshausen had indicated a dip towards the Pole south
of the Pacific; Weddell a still more pronounced dip to the
<a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii"></a>south of the Atlantic, having sailed to a latitude of 74&deg; 15&acute; S.
in longitude 34&deg; 16&acute; W.</p>

<p>Had there been a Tetrahedronal Theory in those days,
some one might have suggested the probability of a third
indentation beneath the Indian Ocean, probably to be
laughed at for his pains. When James Clark Ross started
from England in 1839 there was no particular reason for
him to suppose that the Antarctic coast-line in the region
of the magnetic Pole, which he was to try to reach, did not
continue to follow the Antarctic Circle.</p>

<p>Ross left England in September 1839 under instructions
from the Admiralty. He had under his command
two of Her Majesty's sailing ships, the Erebus, 370 tons,
and the Terror, 340 tons. Arriving in Hobart, Tasmania,
in August 1840, he was met by news of discoveries made
during the previous summer by the French Expedition
under Dumont D'Urville and the United States Expedition
under Charles Wilkes. The former had coasted along
Ad&eacute;lie Land, and for sixty miles of ice cliff to the west
of it. He brought back an egg now at Drayton which
Scott's Discovery Expedition definitely proved to be that
of an Emperor penguin.</p>

<p>All these discoveries were somewhere about the latitude
of the Antarctic Circle (66&deg; 32&acute; S.) and roughly in
that part of the world which lies to the south of Australia.
Ross, &quot;impressed with the feeling that England had ever
<i>led</i> the way of discovery in the southern as well as in the
northern region, ... resolved at once to avoid all interference
with their discoveries, and selected a much more
easterly meridian (170&deg; E.), on which to penetrate to the
southward, and if possible reach the magnetic Pole.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The outlines of the expedition in which an unknown
and unexpected sea was found, stretching 500 miles southwards
towards the Pole, are well known to students of Antarctic
history. After passing through the pack he stood
towards the supposed position of the magnetic Pole, &quot;steering
as nearly south by the compass as the wind admitted,&quot;
and on January 11, 1841, in latitude 71&deg; 15&acute; S., he sighted,
<a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii"></a>the white peaks of Mount Sabine and shortly afterwards
Cape Adare. Foiled by the presence of land from gaining
the magnetic Pole, he turned southwards (true) into what
is now called the Ross Sea, and, after spending many days
in travelling down this coast-line with the mountains on
his right hand, the Ross Sea on his left, he discovered and
named the great line of mountains which here for some five
hundred miles divides the sea from the Antarctic plateau.
On January 27, &quot;with a favourable breeze and very clear
weather, we stood to the southward, close to some land
which had been in sight since the preceding noon, and
which we then called the High Island; it proved to be a
mountain twelve thousand four hundred feet of elevation
above the level of the sea, emitting flame and smoke in
great profusion; at first the smoke appeared like snowdrift,
but as we drew nearer its true character became manifest.... I
named it Mount Erebus, and an extinct volcano
to the eastward, little inferior in height, being by measurement
ten thousand nine hundred feet high, was called
Mount Terror.&quot; That is the first we hear of our two old
friends, and Ross Island is the land upon which they stand.</p>

<p>&quot;As we approached the land under all studding-sails
we perceived a low white line extending from its eastern
extreme point as far as the eye could discern to the eastward.
It presented an extraordinary appearance, gradually
increasing in height as we got nearer to it, and proving at
length to be a perpendicular cliff of ice, between one hundred
and fifty and two hundred feet above the level of the
sea, perfectly flat and level at the top, and without any fissures
or promontories on its even seaward face.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Ross coasted along the Barrier for some 250 miles from
Cape Crozier, as he called the eastern extremity of Ross
Island, after the commander of the Terror. This point
where land, sea and moving Barrier meet will be constantly
mentioned in this narrative. Returning, he looked into
the Sound which divides Ross Island from the western
mountains. On February 16 &quot;Mount Erebus was seen at
2.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and, the weather becoming very clear, we had a
<a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv"></a>splendid view of the whole line of coast, to all appearance
connecting it with the main land, which we had not before
suspected to be the case.&quot; The reader will understand
that Ross makes a mistake here, since Mounts Erebus and
Terror are upon an island connected to the mainland only
by a sheet of ice. He continues: &quot;A very deep bight was
observed to extend far to the south-west from Cape Bird
[Bird was the senior lieutenant of the Erebus], in which a
line of low land might be seen; but its determination was
too uncertain to be left unexplored; and as the wind blowing
feebly from the west prevented our making any way in
that direction through the young ice that now covered the
surface of the ocean in every part, as far as we could see
from the mast-head, I determined to steer towards the
bight to give it a closer examination, and to learn with more
certainty its continuity or otherwise. At noon we were in
latitude 76&deg; 32&acute; S., longitude 166&deg; 12&acute; E., dip 88&deg; 24&acute; and
variation 107&deg; 18&acute; E.</p>

<p>&quot;During the afternoon we were nearly becalmed, and
witnessed some magnificent eruptions of Mount Erebus,
the flame and smoke being projected to a great height;
but we could not, as on a former occasion, discover any
lava issuing from the crater; although the exhibitions of
to-day were upon a much grander scale....</p>

<p>&quot;Soon after midnight (February 16-17) a breeze
sprang up from the eastward and we made all sail to the
southward until 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, although we had an hour before
distinctly traced the land entirely round the bay connecting
Mount Erebus with the mainland. I named it McMurdo
Bay, after the senior lieutenant of the Terror, a compliment
that his zeal and skill well merited.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is now called
McMurdo Sound.</p>

<p>In making the mistake of connecting Erebus with the
mainland Ross was looking at a distance upon the Hut
Point Peninsula running out from the S.W. corner of
Erebus towards the west. He probably saw Minna Bluff,
which juts out from the mainland towards the east. Between
them, and in front of the Bluff, lie White Island,<a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv"></a>
Black Island and Brown Island. To suppose them to be part
of a line of continuous land was a very natural mistake.</p>

<p>Ross broke through the pack ice into an unknown
sea: he laid down many hundreds of miles of mountainous
coast-line, and (with further work completed in 1842)
some 400 miles of the Great Ice Barrier: he penetrated in
his ships to the extraordinarily high latitude of 78&deg; 11&acute; S.,
four degrees farther than Weddell. The scientific work of
his expedition was no less worthy of praise. The South Magnetic
Pole was fixed with comparative accuracy, though
Ross was disappointed in his natural but &quot;perhaps too ambitious
hope I had so long cherished of being permitted
to plant the flag of my country on both the magnetic Poles
of our globe.&quot;</p>

<p>Before all things he was at great pains to be accurate,
both in his geographical and scientific observations, and
his records of meteorology, water temperatures, soundings,
as also those concerning the life in the oceans through
which he passed, were not only frequent but trustworthy.</p>

<p>When Ross returned to England in 1843 it was impossible
not to believe that the case of those who advocated the
existence of a South Polar continent was considerably
strengthened. At the same time there was no proof that
the various blocks of land which had been discovered were
connected with one another. Even now in 1921, after
twenty years of determined exploration aided by the most
modern appliances, the interior of this supposed continent
is entirely unknown and uncharted except in the Ross Sea
area, while the fringes of the land are only discovered in
perhaps a dozen places on a circumference of about eleven
thousand miles.</p>

<p>In his Life of Sir Joseph Hooker, Dr. Leonard Huxley
has given us some interesting sidelights on this expedition
under Ross. Hooker was the botanist of the expedition
and assistant surgeon to the Erebus, being 22 years old
when he left England in 1839. Natural history came off
very badly in the matter of equipment from the Government,
who provided twenty-five reams of paper, two botanizing
vascula and two cases for bringing home live plants:<a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi"></a>
that was all, not an instrument, nor a book, nor a bottle,
and rum from the ship's stores was the only preservative.
And when they returned, the rich collections which they
brought back were never fully worked out. Ross's special
branch of science was terrestrial magnetism, but he was
greatly interested in Natural History, and gave up part of
his cabin for Hooker to work in. &quot;Almost every day I
draw, sometimes all day long and till two and three in the
morning, the Captain directing me; he sits on one side of
the table, writing and figuring at night, and I on the other,
drawing. Every now and then he breaks off and comes to
my side, to see what I am after ...&quot; and, &quot;as you may
suppose, we have had one or two little tiffs, neither of us
perhaps being helped by the best of tempers; but nothing
can exceed the liberality with which he has thrown open
his cabin to me and made it my workroom at no little inconvenience
to himself.&quot;</p>

<p>Another extract from Hooker's letters after the first
voyage runs as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;The success of the Expedition in Geographical discovery
is really wonderful, and only shows what a little
perseverance will do, for we have been in no dangerous
predicaments, and have suffered no hardships whatever:
there has been a sort of freemasonry among Polar voyagers
to keep up the credit they have acquired as having done
wonders, and accordingly, such of us as were new to the
ice made up our minds for frost-bites, and attached a most
undue importance to the simple operation of boring packs,
etc., which have now vanished, though I am not going to
tell everybody so; I do not here refer to travellers, who do
indeed undergo unheard-of hardships, but to voyagers who
have a snug ship, a little knowledge of the Ice, and due
caution is all that is required.&quot;</p>

<p>In the light of Scott's leading of the expedition of which
I am about to tell, and the extraordinary scientific activity
of Pennell in command of the Terra Nova after Scott was
landed, Hooker would have to qualify a later extract, &quot;nor
is it probable that any future collector will have a Captain
so devoted to the cause of Marine Zoology, and so con<a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii"></a>stantly
on the alert to snatch the most trifling opportunities
of adding to the collection....&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, we have a picture of the secrecy which was imposed
upon all with regard to the news they should write
home and the precautions against any leakage of scientific
results. And we see Hooker jumping down the main hatch
with a penguin skin in his hand which he was preparing for
himself, when Ross came up the after hatch unexpectedly.
That <i>has</i> happened on the Terra Nova!</p>

<p>Ross had a cold reception on his return, and Scott wrote
to Hooker in 1905:</p>

<p>&quot;At first it seems inexplicable when one considers how
highly his work is now appreciated. From the point of
view of the general public, however, I have always thought
that Ross was neglected, and as you once said he is very
far from doing himself justice in his book. I did not know
that Barrow was the b&ecirc;te noire who did so much to discount
Ross's results. It is an interesting sidelight on such
a venture.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In discussing and urging the importance of the Antarctic
Expedition which was finally sent under Scott in the
Discovery, Hooker urged the importance of work in the
South Polar Ocean, which swarms with animal and vegetable
life. Commenting upon the fact that the large collections
made chiefly by himself had never been worked out,
except the diatoms, he writes:</p>

<p>&quot;A better fate, I trust, awaits the treasures that the
hoped-for Expedition will bring back, for so prolific is the
ocean that the naturalist need never be idle, no, not even
for one of the twenty-four hours of daylight during a whole
Antarctic summer, and I look to the results of a comparison
of the oceanic life of the Arctic and Antarctic regions as
the heralding of an epoch in the history of biology.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>When Ross went to the Antarctic it was generally
thought that there was neither food nor oxygen nor light
in the depths of the ocean, and that therefore there was no
life. Among other things the investigations of Ross gave
<a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii"></a>ground for thinking this was not the case. Later still, in
1873, the possibility of laying submarine cables made it
necessary to investigate the nature of the abyssal depths,
and the Challenger proved that not only does life, and in
quite high forms, exist there, but that there are fish which
can see. It is now almost certain that there is a great oxidized
northward-creeping current which flows out of the
Antarctic Ocean and under the waters of the other great
oceans of the world.</p>

<p>It was the good fortune of Ross, at a time when the
fringes of the great Antarctic continent were being discovered
in comparatively low latitudes of 66&deg; and thereabouts,
sometimes not even within the Antarctic Circle, to
find to the south of New Zealand a deep inlet in which he
could sail to the high latitude of 78&deg;. This inlet, which
is now known as the Ross Sea, has formed the starting-place
of all sledging parties which have approached the
South Pole. I have dwelt upon this description of the
lands he discovered because they will come very intimately
into this history. I have also emphasized his importance
in the history of Antarctic exploration because Ross having
done what it was possible to do by sea, penetrating so far
south and making such memorable discoveries, the next
necessary step in Antarctic exploration was that another
traveller should follow up his work on land. It is an amazing
thing that sixty years were allowed to elapse before
that traveller appeared. When he appeared he was Scott.
In the sixty years which elapsed between Ross and Scott
the map of the Antarctic remained practically unaltered.
Scott tackled the land, and Scott is the Father of Antarctic
sledge travelling.</p>

<p>This period of time saw a great increase in the interest
taken in science both pure and applied, and it had
been pointed out in 1893 that &quot;we knew more about the
planet Mars than about a large area of our own globe.&quot;
The Challenger Expedition of 1874 had spent three weeks
within the Antarctic Circle, and the specimens brought
home by her from the depths of these cold seas had aroused
curiosity. Meanwhile Borchgrevink (1897) landed at Cape<a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix"></a>
Adare, and built a hut which still stands and which afforded
our Cape Adare party valuable assistance. Here he lived
during the first winter which men spent in the Antarctic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the Arctic, brave work was being done.
The names of Parry, M'Clintock, Franklin, Markham,
Nares, Greely and De Long are but a few of the many
which suggest themselves of those who have fought their
way mile by mile over rough ice and open leads with appliances
which now seem to be primitive and with an addition
to knowledge which often seemed hardly commensurate
with the hardships suffered and the disasters which
sometimes overtook them. To those whose fortune it has
been to serve under Scott the Franklin Expedition has
more than ordinary interest, for it was the same ships, the
Erebus and Terror, which discovered Ross Island, that
were crushed in the northern ice after Franklin himself
had died, and it was Captain Crozier (the same Crozier
who was Ross's captain in the South and after whom Cape
Crozier is named) who then took command and led that
most ghastly journey in all the history of exploration:
more we shall never know, for none survived to tell the tale.
Now, with the noise and racket of London all round them,
a statue of Scott looks across to one of Franklin and his
men of the Erebus and Terror, and surely they have some
thoughts in common.</p>

<p>Englishmen had led the way in the North, but it must
be admitted that the finest journey of all was made by
the Norwegian Nansen in 1893-1896. Believing in a drift
from the neighbourhood of the New Siberian Islands westwards
over the Pole, a theory which obtained confirmation
by the discovery off the coast of Greenland of certain remains
of a ship called the Jeannette which had been crushed
in the ice off these islands, his bold project was to be frozen
in with his ship and allow the current to take him over, or
as near as possible to, the Pole. For this purpose the most
famous of Arctic ships was built, called the Fram. She was
designed by Colin Archer, and was saucer-shaped, with a
breadth one-third of her total length. With most of the expert
Arctic opinion against him, Nansen believed that this
<a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx"></a>ship would rise and sit on the top of the ice when pressed,
instead of being crushed. Of her wonderful voyage with
her thirteen men, of how she was frozen into the ice in
September 1893 in the north of Siberia (79&deg; N.) and of the
heaving and trembling of the ship amidst the roar of the ice
pressure, of how the Fram rose to the occasion as she was
built to do, the story has still, after twenty-eight years,
the thrill of novelty. She drifted over the eightieth degree
on February 2, 1894. During the first winter Nansen
was already getting restive: the drift was so slow, and
sometimes it was backwards: it was not until the second
autumn that the eighty-second degree arrived. So he decided
that he would make an attempt to penetrate northwards
by sledging during the following spring. As Nansen
has told me, he felt that the ship would do her job in
any case. Could not something more be done also?</p>

<p>This was one of the bravest decisions a polar explorer
has ever taken. It meant leaving a drifting ship which
could not be regained: it meant a return journey over
drifting ice to land; the nearest known land was nearly five
hundred miles south of the point from which he started
northwards; and the journey would include travelling both
by sea and by ice.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there was more risk in leaving the Fram
than in remaining in her. It is a laughable absurdity to say,
as Greely did after Nansen's almost miraculous return, that
he had deserted his men in an ice-beset ship, and deserved
to be censured for doing so.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The ship was left in the command
of Sverdrup. Johansen was chosen to be Nansen's
one companion, and we shall hear of him again in the Fram,
this time with Amundsen in his voyage to the South.</p>

<p>The polar traveller is so interested in the adventure and
hardships of Nansen's sledge journey that his equipment,
which is the most important side of his expedition to us
who have gone South, is liable to be overlooked. The
modern side of polar travel begins with Nansen. It was
Nansen who first used a light sledge based upon the ski
sledge of Norway, in place of the old English heavy sledge
<a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi"></a>which was based upon the Eskimo type. Cooking apparatus,
food, tents, clothing and the thousand and one details
of equipment without which no journey nowadays stands
much chance of success, all date back to Nansen in the immediate
past, though beyond him of course is the experience
of centuries of travellers. As Nansen himself wrote
of the English polar men: &quot;How well was their equipment
thought out and arranged with the means they had at their
disposal! Truly, there is nothing new under the sun.
Most of what I prided myself upon, and what I thought to
be new, I find they had anticipated. M'Clintock used the
same things forty years ago. It was not their fault that they
were born in a country where the use of snowshoes is unknown....&quot;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>All the more honour to the men who dared so much and
travelled so far with the limited equipment of the past.
The real point for us is that, just as Scott is the Father of
Antarctic sledge travelling, so Nansen may be considered
the modern Father of it all.</p>

<p>Nansen and Johansen started on March 14 when the
Fram was in latitude 84&deg; 4&acute; N., and the sun had only returned
a few days before, with three sledges (two of which
carried kayaks) and 28 dogs. They reached their northern-most
camp on April 8, which Nansen has given in his
book as being in latitude 86&deg; 13.6&acute; N. But Nansen tells
me that Professor Geelmuyden, who had his astronomical
results and his diary, reckoned that owing to refraction
the horizon was lifted, and if so the observation had to be
reduced accordingly. Nansen therefore gave the reduced
latitude in his book, but he considers that his horizon was
very clear when he took that observation, and believes that
his latitude was higher than that given. He used a sextant
and the natural horizon.</p>

<p>They turned, and travelling back round pressed-up ice
and open leads they failed to find the land they had been
led to expect in latitude 83&deg;, which indeed was proved to
be non-existent. At the end of June they started using
the kayaks, which needed many repairs after their rough
<a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii"></a>passage, to cross the open leads. They waited long in
camp, that the travelling conditions might improve, and
all the time Nansen saw a white spot he thought was cloud.
At last, on July 24, land was in sight, which proved to be
that white spot. Fourteen days later they reached it to
find that it consisted of a series of islands. These they
left behind them and, unable to say what land they had
reached, for their watches had run down, they coasted on
westwards and southwards until winter approached. They
built a hut of moss and stones and snow, and roofed it with
walrus skins cut from the animals while they lay in the sea,
for they were too heavy for two men to drag on to the ice.
When I met Nansen he had forgotten all about this, and
would not believe that it had happened until he saw it in
his own book. They lay in their old clothes that winter,
so soaked with blubber that the only way to clean their
shirts was to scrape them. They made themselves new
clothes from blankets, and sleeping-bags from the skins
of the bears which they ate, and started again in May of
the following year to make Spitzbergen. They had been
travelling a long month, during which time they had at
least two very narrow escapes&mdash;the first due to their kayaks
floating away, when Nansen swam out into the icy sea and
reached them just before he sank, and Johansen passed
the worst moments of his life watching from the shore;
the second caused by the attack of a walrus which went
for Nansen's kayak with tusks and flippers. And then one
morning, as he looked round at the cold glaciers and naked
cliffs, not knowing where he was, he heard a dog bark.
Intensely excited, he started towards the sound, to be met
by the leader of the English Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition
whose party was wintering there, and who first gave
him the definite news that he was on Franz Josef Land.
Nansen and Johansen were finally landed at Vardo in the
north of Norway, to learn that no tidings had yet been
heard of the Fram. That very day she cleared the ice which
had imprisoned her for nearly three years.</p>

<p>I cannot go into the Fram's journey save to say that
she had drifted as far north as 85&deg; 55&acute; N., only eighteen
<a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii"></a>geographical miles south of Nansen's farthest north. But
the sledge journey and the winter spent by the two men
has many points in common with the experience of our
own Northern Party, and often and often during the
long winter of 1912 our thoughts turned with hope to
Nansen's winter, for we said if it had been done once why
should it not be done again, and Campbell and his men
survive.</p>

<p>Before Nansen started, the spirit of adventure, which
has always led men into the unknown, combined with
the increased interest in knowledge for its own sake to
turn the thoughts of the civilized world southwards. It
was becoming plain that a continent of the extent and
climate which this polar land probably possessed might
have an overwhelming influence upon the weather conditions
of the whole Southern Hemisphere. The importance
of magnetism was only rivalled by the mystery in which the
whole subject was shrouded: and the region which surrounded
the Southern Magnetic Pole of the earth offered
a promising field of experiment and observation. The past
history, through the ages, of this land was of obvious importance
to the geological story of the earth, whilst the
survey of land formations and ice action in the Antarctic
was more useful perhaps to the physiographer than that of
any other country in the world, seeing that he found here
in daily and even hourly operation the conditions which
he knew had existed in the ice ages of the past over the
whole world, but which he could only infer from vestigial
remains. The biological importance of the Antarctic
might be of the first magnitude in view of the significance
which attaches to the life of the sea in the evolutionary
problem.</p>

<p>And it was with these objects and ideals that Scott's
first expedition, known officially as the British Antarctic
Expedition of 1901-1904, but more familiarly as 'The
Discovery Expedition,' from the name of the ship which
carried it, was organized by the Royal Society and the
Royal Geographical Society, backed by the active support
of the British Government. The executive officers and
<a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv"></a>crew were Royal Navy almost without exception, whilst
the scientific purposes of the expedition were served in
addition by five scientists. These latter were not naval
officers.</p>

<p>The Discovery left New Zealand on Christmas Eve
1901, and entered the belt of pack ice which always has to
be penetrated in order to reach the comparatively open sea
beyond, when just past the Antarctic Circle. But a little
more than four days saw her through, in which she was
lucky, as we now know. Scott landed at Cape Adare and
then coasted down the western coast of Victoria Land just
as Ross had done sixty years before. As he voyaged south
he began to look for safe winter quarters for the ship, and
when he pushed into McMurdo Sound on January 21,
1902, it seemed that here he might find both a sheltered
bay into which the ship could be frozen, and a road to the
southland beyond.</p>

<p>The open season which still remained before the freezing
of the sea made progress impossible was spent in surveying
the 500 miles of cliff which marks the northern
limit of the Great Ice Barrier. Passing the extreme eastward
position reached by Ross in 1842, they sailed on into
an unknown world, and discovered a deep bay, called
Balloon Bight, where the rounded snow-covered slopes
undoubtedly were land and not, as heretofore, floating ice.
Farther east, as they sailed, shallow soundings and gentle
snow slopes gave place to steeper and more broken ridges,
until at last small black patches in the snow gave undoubted
evidence of rock; and an undiscovered land, now known
as King Edward VII.'s Land, rose to a height of several
thousand feet. The presence of thick pack ahead, and the
advance of the season, led Scott to return to McMurdo
Sound, where he anchored the Discovery in a little bay at
the end of the tongue of land now known as the Hut Point
Peninsula, and built the hut which, though little used in
the Discovery days, was to figure so largely in the story of
this his last expedition.</p>

<p>The first autumn was spent in various short journeys of
discovery&mdash;discovery not only of the surrounding land but
<a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv"></a>of many mistakes in sledging equipment and routine. It is
amazing to one who looks back upon these first efforts of
the Discovery Expedition that the results were not more
disastrous than was actually the case. When one reads of
dog-teams which refused to start, of pemmican which was
considered to be too rich to eat, of two officers discussing
the ascent of Erebus and back in one day, and of sledging
parties which knew neither how to use their cookers or
lamp, nor how to put up their tents, nor even how to put
on their clothes, then one begins to wonder that the process
of education was gained at so small a price. &quot;Not a
single article of the outfit had been tested; and amid the
general ignorance that prevailed the lack of system was
painfully apparent in everything.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>This led to a tragedy. A returning sledge party of
men was overtaken by a blizzard on the top of the Peninsula
near Castle Rock. They quite properly camped, and
should have been perfectly comfortable lying in their sleeping-bags
after a hot meal. But the primus lamps could not
be lighted, and as they sat in leather boots and inadequate
clothing being continually frost-bitten they decided to leave
the tent and make their way to the ship&mdash;sheer madness as
we now know. As they groped their way in the howling
snow-drift the majority of the party either slipped or rolled
down a steep slippery snow slope some thousand feet high
ending in a precipitous ice-cliff, below which lay the open
sea. It is a nasty place on a calm summer day: in a blizzard
it must be ghastly. Yet only one man, named Vince,
shot down the slope and over the precipice into the sea
below. How the others got back heaven knows. One seaman
called Hare, who separated from the others and lay
down under a rock, awoke after thirty-six hours, covered
with snow but in full possession of his faculties and free
from frost-bites. The little cross at Hut Point commemorates
the death of Vince. One of this party was a seaman
called Wild, who came to the front and took the lead of
five of the survivors after the death of Vince. He was to
take the lead often in future expeditions under Shackleton
<a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi"></a>and Mawson, and there are few men living who have so
proved themselves as polar travellers.</p>

<p>I have dwelt upon this side of the early sledging deficiencies
of the Discovery to show the importance of experience
in Antarctic land travelling, whether it be at first or
second hand. Scott and his men in 1902 were pioneers.
They bought their experience at a price which might easily
have been higher; and each expedition which has followed
has added to the fund. The really important thing
is that nothing of what is gained should be lost. It is
one of the main objects of this book to hand on as complete
a record as possible of the methods, equipment, food
and weights used by Scott's Last Expedition for the use of
future explorers. &quot;The first object of writing an account
of a Polar voyage is the guidance of future voyagers: the
first duty of the writer is to his successors.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The adaptability, invention and resource of the men of
the Discovery when they set to work after the failures of
the autumn to prepare for the successes of the two following
summers showed that they could rise to their difficulties.
Scott admitted that &quot;food, clothing, everything
was wrong, the whole system was bad.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In determining
to profit by his mistakes, and working out a complete
system of Antarctic travel, he was at his best; and it was
after a winter of drastic reorganization that he started on
November 2, 1902, on his first southern journey with two
companions, Wilson and Shackleton.</p>

<p>It is no part of my job to give an account of this journey.
The dogs failed badly: probably the Norwegian stock-fish
which had been brought through the tropics to feed
them was tainted: at any rate they sickened; and before
the journey was done all the dogs had to be killed or had
died. A fortnight after starting, the party was relaying&mdash;that
is, taking on part of their load and returning for the
rest; and this had to be continued for thirty-one days.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-2.jpg"><img src="./images/1-2_th.jpg" alt="The Last Of The Dogs&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." title="The Last Of The Dogs&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The Last Of The Dogs</span>&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del.</p>
<hr />


<p>The ration of food was inadequate and they became
very hungry as time went on; but it was not until Decem<a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii"></a>ber
21 that Wilson disclosed to Scott that Shackleton
had signs of scurvy which had been present for some time.
On December 30, in latitude 82&deg; 16&acute; S., they decided to
return. By the middle of January the scurvy signs were
largely increased and Shackleton was seriously ill and spitting
blood. His condition became more and more alarming,
and he collapsed on January 18, but revived afterwards.
Sometimes walking by the sledge, sometimes being
carried upon it, Shackleton survived: Scott and Wilson
saved his life. The three men reached the ship on
February 3, after covering 960 statute miles in 93 days.
Scott and Wilson were both extremely exhausted and
seriously affected by scurvy. It was a fine journey, the
geographical results of which comprised the survey of some
three hundred miles of new coast-line, and a further knowledge
of the Barrier upon which they travelled.</p>

<p>While Scott was away southwards an organized attempt
was made to discover the nature of the mountains and
glaciers which lay across the Sound to the west. This party
actually reached the plateau which lay beyond, and attained
a height of 8900 feet, when &quot;as far as they could see in
every direction to the westward of them there extended a
level plateau, to the south and north could be seen isolated
nunataks, and behind them showed the high mountains
which they had passed&quot;: a practicable road to the west
had been found.</p>

<p>I need note no more than these two most important of
the many journeys carried out this season: nor is it necessary
for me to give any account of the continuous and
fertile scientific work which was accomplished in this
virgin land. In the meantime a relief ship, the Morning,
had arrived. It was intended that the Discovery should
return this year as soon as the sea-ice in which she was
imprisoned should break up and set her free. As February
passed, however, it became increasingly plain that the ice
conditions were altogether different from those of the previous
year. On the 8th the Morning was still separated
from the Discovery by eight miles of fast ice. March 2
was fully late for a low-powered ship to remain in the<a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii"></a>
Sound, and on this date the Morning left. By March 13
all hope of the Discovery being freed that year was abandoned.</p>

<p>The second winter passed much as the first, and as soon
as spring arrived sledging was continued. These spring
journeys on the Barrier, with sunlight only by day and low
temperatures at all times, entailed great discomfort and,
perhaps worse, want of sleep, frost-bites, and a fast accumulation
of moisture in all one's clothing and in the sleeping-bags,
which resulted in masses of ice which had to be
thawed out by the heat of one's body before any degree
of comfort could be gained. A fortnight was considered
about the extreme limit of time for such a journey, and
generally parties were not absent so long; for at this time
a spring journey was considered a dreadful experience.
&quot;Wait till you've had a spring journey&quot; was the threat
of the old stagers to us. A winter journey lasting nearly
three times as long as a spring journey was not imagined.
I advise explorers to be content with imagining it in the
future.</p>

<p>The hardest journey of this year was carried out by
Scott with two seamen of whom much will be written in
this history. Their names are Edgar Evans and Lashly.
The object of the journey was to explore westwards into the
interior of the plateau. By way of the Ferrar Glacier they
reached the ice-cap after considerable troubles, not the
least of which was the loss of the data necessary for navigation
contained in an excellent publication called Hints
to Travellers, which was blown away. Then for the first
time it was seen what additional difficulties are created by
the climate and position of this lofty plateau, which we
now know extends over the Pole and probably reaches over
the greater part of the Antarctic continent. It was the beginning
of November: that is, the beginning of summer;
but the conditions of work were much the same as those
found during the spring journeys on the Barrier. The temperature
dropped into the minus forties; but the worst
feature of all was a continuous head-wind blowing from
west to east which combined with the low temperature and
<a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix"></a>rarefied air to make the conditions of sledging extremely
laborious. The supporting party returned, and the three
men continued alone, pulling out westwards into an unknown
waste of snow with no landmarks to vary the rough
monotony. They turned homewards on December 1, but
found the pulling very heavy; and their difficulties were
increased by their ignorance of their exact position. The
few glimpses of the land which they obtained as they
approached it in the thick weather which prevailed only
left them in horrible uncertainty as to their whereabouts.
Owing to want of food it was impossible to wait for the
weather to clear: there was nothing to be done but to continue
their eastward march. Threading their way amidst
the ice disturbances which mark the head of the glaciers,
the party pushed blindly forward in air which was becoming
thick with snow-drift. Suddenly Lashly slipped: in a
moment the whole party was flying downwards with increasing
speed. They ceased to slide smoothly; they were
hurled into the air and descended with great force on to a
gradual snow incline. Rising they looked round them to
find above them an ice-fall 300 feet high down which they
had fallen: above it the snow was still drifting, but where
they stood there was peace and blue sky. They recognized
now for the first time their own glacier and the well-remembered
landmark, and far away in the distance was the smoking
summit of Mount Erebus. It was a miracle.</p>

<p>Excellent subsidiary journeys were also made of which
space allows no mention here: nor do they bear directly
upon this last expedition. But in view of the Winter Journey
undertaken by us, if not for the interest of the subject
itself, some account must be given of those most aristocratic
inhabitants of the Antarctic, the Emperor penguins, with
whom Wilson and his companions in the Discovery now
became familiar.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of Antarctic penguins&mdash;the little
Ad&eacute;lie with his blue-black coat and his white shirt-front,
weighing 16 lbs., an object of endless pleasure and amusement,
and the great dignified Emperor with long curved
beak, bright orange head-wear and powerful flippers, a
<a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl"></a>personality of 6&frac12; stones. Science singles out the Emperor
as being the more interesting bird because he is more
primitive, possibly the most primitive of all birds. Previous
to the Discovery Expedition nothing was known of him
save that he existed in the pack and on the fringes of the
continent.</p>

<p>We have heard of Cape Crozier as being the eastern
extremity of Ross Island, discovered by Ross and named
after the captain of the Terror. It is here that with immense
pressures and rendings the moving sheet of the
Barrier piles itself up against the mountain. It is here also
that the great ice-cliff which runs for hundreds of miles to
the east, with the Barrier behind it and the Ross Sea beating
into its crevasses and caves, joins the basalt precipice
which bounds the Knoll, as the two-knobbed saddle which
forms Cape Crozier is called. Altogether it is the kind
of place where giants have had a good time in their childhood,
playing with ice instead of mud&mdash;so much cleaner
too!</p>

<p>But the slopes of Mount Terror do not all end in precipices.
Farther to the west they slope quietly into the sea,
and the Ad&eacute;lie penguins have taken advantage of this to
found here one of their largest and most smelly rookeries.
When the Discovery arrived off this rookery she sent a boat
ashore and set up a post with a record upon it to guide the
relief ship in the following year. The post still stands.
Later it became desirable to bring the record left here more
up to date, and so one of the first sledging parties went to
try and find a way by the Barrier to this spot.</p>

<p>They were prevented from reaching the record by a
series of most violent blizzards, and indeed Cape Crozier
is one of the windiest places on earth, but they proved
beyond doubt that a back-door to the Ad&eacute;lie penguins'
rookery existed by way of the slopes of Mount Terror behind
the Knoll. Early the next year another party reached
the record all right, and while exploring the neighbourhood
looked down over the 800-feet precipice which forms
the snout of Cape Crozier. The sea was frozen over, and
in a small bay of ice formed by the cliffs of the Barrier
<a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli"></a>below were numerous little dots which resolved themselves
into Emperor penguins. Could this be the breeding-place
of these wonderful birds? If so, they must nurse their eggs
in mid-winter, in unimagined cold and darkness.</p>

<p>Five days more elapsed before further investigation
could be made, for a violent blizzard kept the party in
their tents. On October 18 they set out to climb the high
pressure ridges which lie between the level barrier and
the sea. They found that their conjectures were right:
there was the colony of Emperors. Several were nursing
chicks, but all the ice in the Ross Sea was gone; only the
small bay of ice remained. The number of adult birds was
estimated at four hundred, the number of living chicks was
thirty, and there were some eighty dead ones. No eggs
were found.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Several more journeys were made to this spot while the
Discovery was in the south, generally in the spring; and
the sum total of the information gained came to something
like this. The Emperor is a bird which cannot fly, lives on
fish which it catches in the sea, and never steps on land
even to breed. For a reason which was not then understood
it lays its eggs upon the bare ice some time during
the winter and carries out the whole process of incubation
on the sea ice, resting the egg upon its feet pressed closely
to a patch of bare skin in the lower abdomen, and protected
from the intense cold by a loose falling lappet of skin and
feathers. By September 12, the earliest date upon which a
party arrived, all the eggs which were not broken or addled
were hatched, and there were then about a thousand adult
Emperors in the rookery. Arriving again on October 19,
a party experienced a ten days' blizzard which confined
them during seven days to their tents, but during their
windy visit they saw one of the most interesting scenes in
natural history. The story must be told by Wilson, who
was there:</p>

<p>&quot;The day before the storm broke we were on an old
outlying cone of Mount Terror, about 1300 feet above the
sea. Below us lay the Emperor penguin rookery on the
<a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii"></a>bay ice, and Ross Sea, completely frozen over, was a plain
of firm white ice to the horizon. There was not even the
lane of open water which usually runs along the Barrier
cliff stretching away as it does like a winding thread to the
east and out of sight. No space or crack could be seen
with open water. Nevertheless the Emperors were unsettled
owing, there can be no doubt, to the knowledge
that bad weather was impending. The mere fact that the
usual canal of open water was not to be seen along the
face of the Barrier meant that the ice in Ross Sea had a
southerly drift. This in itself was unusual, and was caused
by a northerly wind with snow, the precursor here of a
storm from the south-west. The sky looked black and
threatening, the barometer began to fall, and before long
down came snowflakes on the upper heights of Mount
Terror.</p>

<p>&quot;All these warnings were an open book to the Emperor
penguins, and if one knew the truth there probably
were many others too. They were in consequence unsettled,
and although the ice had not yet started moving
the Emperor penguins had; a long file was moving out
from the bay to the open ice, where a pack of some one or
two hundred had already collected about two miles out at
the edge of a refrozen crack. For an hour or more that
afternoon we watched this exodus proceeding, and returned
to camp, more than ever convinced that bad weather
might be expected. Nor were we disappointed, for on the
next day we woke to a southerly gale and smother of snow
and drift, which effectually prevented any one of us from
leaving our camp at all. This continued without intermission
all day and night till the following morning, when the
weather cleared sufficiently to allow us to reach the edge
of the cliff which overlooked the rookery.</p>

<hr />

<p>&quot;The change here was immense. Ross Sea was open
water for nearly thirty miles; a long line of white pack ice
was just visible on the horizon from where we stood, some
800 to 900 feet above the sea. Large sheets of ice were
still going out and drifting to the north, and the migration
of the Emperors was in full swing. There were again two
<a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii"></a>companies waiting on the ice at the actual water's edge,
with some hundred more tailing out in single file to join
them. The birds were waiting far out at the edge of the
open water, as far as it was possible for them to walk, on
a projecting piece of ice, the very next piece that would
break away and drift to the north. The line of tracks in the
snow along which the birds had gone the day before was
now cut off short at the edge of the open water, showing
that they had gone, and under the ice-cliffs there was an
appreciable diminution in the number of Emperors left,
hardly more than half remaining of all that we had seen
there six days before.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Two days later the emigration was still in full swing,
but only the unemployed seemed to have gone as yet.
Those who were nursing chicks were still huddled under
the ice-cliffs, sheltered as much as possible from the storm.
Three days later (October 28) no ice was to be seen in the
Ross Sea: the little bay of ice was gradually being eaten
away: the same exodus was in progress and only a remnant
of penguins was still left.</p>

<p>Of the conditions under which the Emperor lays her
eggs, the darkness and cold and blighting winds, of the excessive
mothering instinct implanted in the heart of every
bird, male and female, of the mortality and gallant struggles
against almost inconceivable odds, and the final survival of
some 26 per cent of the eggs, I hope to tell in the account
of our Winter Journey, the object of which was to throw
light upon the development of the embryo of this remarkable
bird, and through it upon the history of their ancestors.
As Wilson wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;The possibility that we have in the Emperor penguin
the nearest approach to a primitive form not only of a penguin
but of a bird makes the future working out of its
embryology a matter of the greatest possible importance.
It was a great disappointment to us that although we discovered
their breeding-ground, and although we were able
to bring home a number of deserted eggs and chicks, we
were not able to procure a series of early embryos by which
<a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv"></a>alone the points of particular interest can be worked out.
To have done this in a proper manner from the spot at
which the Discovery wintered in McMurdo Sound would
have involved us in endless difficulties, for it would have
entailed the risks of sledge travelling in mid-winter with
an almost total absence of light. It would at any time
require that a party of three at least, with full camp equipment,
should traverse about a hundred miles of the Barrier
surface in the dark and should, by moonlight, cross over
with rope and axe the immense pressure ridges which form
a chaos of crevasses at Cape Crozier. These ridges, moreover,
which have taken a party as much as two hours of
careful work to cross by daylight, must be crossed and
re-crossed at every visit to the breeding site in the bay.
There is no possibility even by daylight of conveying over
them the sledge or camping kit, and in the darkness of
mid-winter the impracticability is still more obvious. Cape
Crozier is a focus for wind and storm, where every breath
is converted, by the configuration of Mounts Erebus and
Terror, into a regular drifting blizzard full of snow. It
is here, as I have already stated, that on one journey or
another we have had to lie patiently in sodden sleeping-bags
for as many as five and seven days on end, waiting for
the weather to change and make it possible for us to leave
our tents at all. If, however, these dangers were overcome
there would still be the difficulty of making the needful
preparations from the eggs. The party would have to be
on the scene at any rate early in July. Supposing that no
eggs were found upon arrival, it would be well to spend
the time in labelling the most likely birds, those for example
that have taken up their stations close underneath the ice-cliffs.
And if this were done it would be easier then to
examine them daily by moonlight, if it and the weather
generally were suitable: conditions, I must confess, not
always easily obtained at Cape Crozier. But if by good
luck things happened to go well, it would by this time be
useful to have a shelter built of snow blocks on the sea-ice
in which to work with the cooking lamp to prevent the
freezing of the egg before the embryo was cut out, and in
<a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv"></a>order that fluid solutions might be handy for the various
stages of its preparation; for it must be borne in mind that
the temperature all the while may be anything between
zero and -50&deg; F. The whole work no doubt would be
full of difficulty, but it would not be quite impossible, and
it is with a view to helping those to whom the opportunity
may occur in future that this outline has been added of
the difficulties that would surely beset their path.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>We shall meet the Emperor penguins again, but now
we must go back to the Discovery, lying off Hut Point,
with the season advancing and twenty miles of ice between
her and the open sea. The prospects of getting out this
year seeming almost less promising than those of the last
year, an abortive attempt was made to saw a channel from
a half-way point. Still, life to Scott and Wilson in a tent
at Cape Royds was very pleasant after sledging, and the
view of the blue sea framed in the tent door was very
beautiful on a morning in January when two ships sailed
into the frame. Why two? One was of course the Morning;
the second proved to be the Terra Nova.</p>

<p>It seemed that the authorities at home had been alarmed
at the reports brought back the previous year by the relief
ship of the detention of the Discovery and certain outbreaks
of scurvy which had occurred both on the ship and
on sledge journeys. To make sure of relief two ships had
been sent. That was nothing to worry about, but the orders
they brought were staggering to sailors who had come to
love their ship &quot;with a depth of sentiment which cannot
be surprising when it is remembered what we had been
through in her and what a comfortable home she had
proved.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Scott was ordered to abandon the Discovery if
she could not be freed in time to accompany the relief
ships to the north. For weeks there was little or no daily
change. They started to transport the specimens and make
the other necessary preparations. They almost despaired
of freedom. Explosions in the ice were started in the beginning
of February with little effect. But suddenly there
<a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi"></a>came a change, and on the 11th, amidst intense excitement,
the ice was breaking up fast. The next day the relief ships
were but four miles away. On the 14th a shout of &quot;The
ships are coming, sir!&quot; brought out all the men racing to
the slopes above Arrival Bay. Scott wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;The ice was breaking up right across the Strait, and
with a rapidity which we had not thought possible. No
sooner was one great floe borne away than a dark streak
cut its way into the solid sheet that remained, and carved
out another, to feed the broad stream of pack which was
hurrying away to the north-west.</p>

<p>&quot;I have never witnessed a more impressive sight; the
sun was low behind us, the surface of the ice-sheet in front
was intensely white, and in contrast the distant sea and its
leads looked almost black. The wind had fallen to a calm,
and not a sound disturbed the stillness about us.</p>

<p>&quot;Yet in the midst of this peaceful silence was an awful
unseen agency rending that great ice-sheet as though it had
been naught but the thinnest paper. We knew well by this
time the nature of our prison bars; we had not plodded
again and again over those long dreary miles of snow without
realizing the formidable strength of the great barrier
which held us bound; we knew that the heaviest battle-ship
would have shattered itself ineffectually against it, and
we had seen a million-ton iceberg brought to rest at its
edge. For weeks we had been struggling with this mighty
obstacle ... but now without a word, without an effort on
our part, it was all melting away, and we knew that in an
hour or two not a vestige of it would be left, and that the
open sea would be lapping on the black rocks of Hut
Point.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Almost more dramatic was the grounding of the Discovery
off the shoal at Hut Point owing to the rise of a
blizzard immediately after her release from the ice. Hour
after hour she lay pounding on the shore, and when it
seemed most certain that she had been freed only to be
destroyed, and when all hope was nearly gone, the wind
lulled, and the waters of the Sound, driven out by the force
<a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii"></a>of the wind, returned and the Discovery floated off with
little damage. The whole story of the release from the ice
and subsequent grounding of the Discovery is wonderfully
told by Scott in his book.</p>

<p>Some years after this I met Wilson in a shooting lodge
in Scotland. He was working upon grouse disease for the
Royal Commission which had been appointed, and I saw
then for the first time something of his magnetic personality
and glimpses also of his methods of work. He and
Scott both meant to go back and finish the job, and I then
settled that when they went I would go too if wishing
could do anything. Meanwhile Shackleton was either in
the South or making his preparations to go there.</p>

<p>He left England in 1908, and in the following Antarctic
summer two wonderful journeys were made. The first,
led by Shackleton himself, consisted of four men and four
ponies. Leaving Cape Royds, where the expedition wintered
in a hut, in November, they marched due south on
the Barrier outside Scott's track until they were stopped
by the eastward trend of the range of mountains, and by
the chaotic pressure caused by the discharge of a Brobdingnagian
glacier.</p>

<p>But away from the main stream of the glacier, and separated
from it by land now known as Hope Island, was a
narrow and steep snow slope forming a gateway which
opened on to the main glacier stream. Boldly plunging
through this, the party made its way up the Beardmore
Glacier, a giant of its kind, being more than twice as
large as any other known. The history of their adventures
will make anybody's flesh creep. From the top they travelled
due south toward the Pole under the trying conditions
of the plateau and reached the high latitude of
88&deg; 23&acute; S. before they were forced to turn by lack of food.</p>

<p>While Shackleton was essaying the geographical Pole
another party of three men under Professor David reached
the magnetic Pole, travelling a distance of 1260 miles, of
which 740 miles were relay work, relying entirely on man-haulage,
and with no additional help. This was a very
wonderful journey, and when Shackleton returned in 1909
<a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii"></a>he and his expedition had made good. During the same
year the North Pole was reached by Peary after some
twelve years of travelling in Arctic regions.</p>

<p>Scott published the plans of his second expedition
in 1909. This expedition is the subject of the present
history.</p>

<p>The Terra Nova sailed from the West India Dock,
London, on June 1, 1910, and from Cardiff on June 15.
She made her way to New Zealand, refitted and restowed
her cargo, took on board ponies, dogs, motor sledges,
certain further provisions and equipment, as well as such
members of her executive officers and scientists as had
not travelled out in her, and left finally for the South on
November 29, 1910. She arrived in McMurdo Sound on
January 4, 1911, and our hut had been built on Cape
Evans and all stores landed in less than a fortnight.
Shortly afterwards the ship sailed. The party which was
left at Cape Evans under Scott is known as the Main
Party.</p>

<p>But the scientific objects of the expedition included the
landing of a second but much smaller party under Campbell
on King Edward VII.'s Land. While returning from
an abortive attempt to land here they found a Norwegian
expedition under Captain Roald Amundsen in Nansen's
old ship the Fram in the Bay of Whales: reference to
this expedition will be found elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> One member of
Amundsen's party was Johansen, the only companion of
Nansen on his famous Arctic sledge journey, of which a
brief outline has been given above.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Campbell and his five
companions were finally landed at Cape Adare, and built
their hut close to Borchgrevinck's old winter quarters.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The ship returned to New Zealand under Pennell: came
back to the Antarctic a year later with further equipment
and provisions, and again two years later to bring back to
civilization the survivors of the expedition.</p>

<p>The adventures and journeyings of the various members
of the Main Party are so numerous and simultaneous that
I believe it will help the reader who approaches this book
<a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix"></a>without previous knowledge of the history of the expedition
to give here a brief summary of the course of events.
Those who are familiar already with these facts can easily
skip a page or two.</p>

<p>Two parties were sent out during the first autumn: the
one under Scott to lay a large dep&ocirc;t on the Barrier for the
Polar Journey, and this is called the Dep&ocirc;t Journey; the
other to carry out geological work among the Western
Mountains, so called because they form the western side
of McMurdo Sound: this is called the First Geological
Journey, and another similar journey during the following
summer is called the Second Geological Journey.</p>

<p>Both parties joined up at the old Discovery Hut at Hut
Point in March 1911, and here waited for the sea to freeze
a passage northwards to Cape Evans. Meanwhile the men
left at Cape Evans were continuing the complex scientific
work of the station. All the members of the Main Party
were not gathered together at Cape Evans for the winter
until May 12. During the latter half of the winter a journey
was made by three men led by Wilson to Cape Crozier
to investigate the embryology of the Emperor penguin:
this is called the Winter Journey.</p>

<p>The journey to the South Pole absorbed the energies of
most of the sledging members during the following summer
of 1911-12. The motor party turned back on the
Barrier; the dog party at the bottom of the Beardmore
Glacier. From this point twelve men went forward. Four
of these men under Atkinson returned from the top of the
glacier in latitude 85&deg; 3&acute; S.: they are known as the First
Return Party. A fortnight later in latitude 87&deg; 32&acute; S. three
more men returned under Lieutenant Evans: these are
the Second Return Party. Five men went forward, Scott,
Wilson, Bowers, Oates and Seaman Evans. They reached
the Pole on January 17 to find that Amundsen had reached
it thirty-four days earlier. They returned 721 statute miles
and perished 177 miles from their winter quarters.</p>

<p>The supporting parties got back safely, but Lieutenant
Evans was very seriously ill with scurvy. The food necessary
for the return of the Polar Party from One Ton Camp
<a name="Page_l" id="Page_l"></a>had not been taken out at the end of February 1912.
Evans' illness caused a hurried reorganization of plans,
and I was ordered to take out this food with one lad and
two dog-teams. This was done, and the journey may be
called the Dog Journey to One Ton Camp.</p>

<p>We must now go back to the six men led by Campbell
who were landed at Cape Adare in the beginning of 1911.
They were much disappointed by the small amount of
sledge work which they were able to do in the summer of
1911-1912, for the sea-ice in front of them was blown out
early in the year, and they were unable to find a way up
through the mountains behind them on to the plateau.
Therefore, when the Terra Nova appeared on January 4, it
was decided that she should land them with six weeks'
sledging rations and some extra biscuits, pemmican and
general food near Mount Melbourne at Evans Coves, some
250 geographical miles south of Cape Adare, and some 200
geographical miles from our Winter Quarters at Cape
Evans. Late on the night of January 8, 1912, they were
camped in this spot and saw the last of the ship steaming
out of the bay. They had arranged to be picked up again
on February 18.</p>

<p>Let us return to McMurdo Sound. My two dog-teams
arrived at Hut Point from One Ton Dep&ocirc;t on March 16
exhausted. The sea-ice was still in from the Barrier to
Hut Point, but from there onwards was open water, and
therefore no communication was possible with Cape Evans.
Atkinson, with one seaman, was at Hut Point and the situation
which he outlined to me on arrival was something as
follows:</p>

<p>The ship had left and there was now no possibility of
her returning owing to the lateness of the season, and she
carried in her Lieut. Evans, sick with scurvy, and five other
officers and three men who were returning home this year.
This left only four officers and four men at Cape Evans, in
addition to the four of us at Hut Point.</p>

<p>The serious part of the news was that owing to a heavy
pack the ship had been absolutely unable to reach Campbell's
party at Evans Coves. Attempt after attempt had
<a name="Page_li" id="Page_li"></a>made without success. Would Campbell winter where
he was? Would he try to sledge down the coast?</p>

<p>In the absence of Scott the command of the expedition
under the extraordinarily difficult circumstances which
arose, both now and during the coming year, would naturally
have devolved upon Lieutenant Evans. But Evans,
very sick, was on his way to England. The task fell to
Atkinson, and I hope that these pages will show how difficult
it was, and how well he tackled it.</p>

<p>There were now, that is since the arrival of the dog-teams
four of us at Hut Point; and no help could be got
from Cape Evans owing to the open water which intervened.
Two of us were useless for further sledging and the
dogs were absolutely done. As time went on anxiety concerning
the non-arrival of the Polar Party was added to the
alarm we already felt about Campbell and his men; winter
was fast closing down, and the weather was bad. So little
could be done by two men. What was to be done? When
was it to be done with the greatest possible chance of success?
Added to all his greater anxieties Atkinson had me
on his hands&mdash;and I was pretty ill.</p>

<p>In the end he made two attempts.</p>

<p>The first with one seaman, Keohane, to sledge out on
to the Barrier, leaving on March 26. They found the conditions
very bad, but reached a point a few miles south
of Corner Camp and returned. Soon after we knew the
Southern Party must be dead.</p>

<p>Nothing more could be done until communication was
effected with Winter Quarters at Cape Evans. This was
done by a sledge journey over the newly frozen ice in the
bays on April 10. Help arrived at Hut Point on April 14.</p>

<p>The second attempt was then made, and this consisted
of a party of four men who tried to sledge up the Western
Coast in order to meet and help Campbell if he was trying
to sledge to us. This plucky attempt failed, as indeed it
was practically certain it would.</p>

<p>The story of the winter that followed will be told, and
of the decision which had to be taken to abandon either the
search for the Polar Party (who must be dead) and their
<a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii"></a>records, or Campbell and his men (who might be alive).
There were not enough men left to do both. We believed
that the Polar Party had come to grief through scurvy, or
through falling into a crevasse&mdash;the true solution never
occurred to us, for we felt sure that except for accident or
disease they could find their way home without difficulty.
We decided to leave Campbell to find his way unaided
down the coast, and to try and find the Polar Party's records.
To our amazement we found their snowed-up tent some
140 geographical miles from Hut Point, only 11 geographical
miles from One Ton Camp. They had arrived
there on March 19. Inside the tent were the bodies of
Scott, Wilson and Bowers. Oates had willingly walked out
to his death some eighteen miles before in a blizzard.
Seaman Evans lay dead at the bottom of the Beardmore
Glacier.</p>

<hr />

<p>Having found the bodies and the records the Search
Party returned, proposing to make their way up the Western
Coast in search of Campbell. On arrival at Hut Point
with the dog-teams, I must have gone to open the hut
door and found pinned on to it a note in Campbell's handwriting;
but my recollection of this apparently memorable
incident is extraordinarily vague. It was many long
months since we had had good news. This was their story.</p>

<p>When Campbell originally landed at Evans Coves he
brought with him sledging provisions for six weeks, in
addition to two weeks' provisions for six men, 56 lbs. sugar,
24 lbs. cocoa, 36 lbs. chocolate and 210 lbs. of biscuit, some
Oxo and spare clothing. In short, after the sledge work
which they proposed, and actually carried out, the men
were left with skeleton rations for four weeks. They had
also a spare tent and an extra sleeping-bag. It was not seriously
anticipated that the ship would have great difficulty
in picking them up in the latter half of February.</p>

<p>Campbell's party had carried out successful sledging
and useful geological work in the region of Evans Coves.
They had then camped on the beach and looked for the
ship to relieve them. There was open water lashed to fury
<a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii"></a>by the wind so far as they could see, and yet she did not
come. They concluded that she must have been wrecked.
The actual fact was that thick pack ice lay beyond their
vision through which Pennell was trying to drive his ship
time after time, until he had either to go or to be frozen in.
He never succeeded in approaching nearer than 27 miles.</p>

<p>It was now that a blizzard wind started to blow down
from the plateau behind them out into the continually open
sea in front. The situation was bad enough already, but
of course such weather conditions made it infinitely worse.
Evans Coves is paved with boulders over which all journeys
had to be fought leaning against the wind as it blew:
when a lull came the luckless traveller fell forward on to his
face. Under these circumstances it was decided that preparations
must be made to winter where they were, and
to sledge down the coast to Cape Evans in the following
spring. The alternative of sledging down the coast in
March and April never seems to have been seriously considered.
At Hut Point, of course, we were entirely in the
dark as to what the party would do, hence Atkinson's journey
over to the western side in April 1912.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the stranded men divided into two parties
of three men each. The first under Campbell sank a shaft
six feet down into a large snow-drift and thence, with pick
and shovel, excavated a passage and at the end of it a cave,
twelve feet by nine feet, and five feet six inches high. The
second under Levick sought out and killed all the seal and
penguin they could find, but their supply was pitifully
small, and the men never had a full meal until mid-winter
night. One man always had to be left to look after the
tents, which were already so worn and damaged that it was
unsafe to leave them in the wind.</p>

<p>By March 17 the cave was sufficiently advanced for
three men to move in. Priestley must tell how this was done,
but it should not be supposed that the weather conditions
were in any way abnormal on what they afterwards called
Inexpressible Island:</p>

<p>&quot;March 17. 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Strong south-west breeze all day,
freshening to a full gale at night. We have had an awful
<a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv"></a>day, but have managed to shift enough gear into the cave
to live there temporarily. Our tempers have never been so
tried during the whole of our life together, but they have
stood the strain pretty successfully.... May I never have
such another three trips as were those to-day. Every time
the wind lulled a little I fell over to windward, and at every
gust I was pitched to leeward, while a dozen times or more
I was taken off my feet and dashed against the ground or
against unfriendly boulders. The other two had equally
bad times. Dickason hurt his knee and ankle and lost his
sheath knife, and Campbell lost a compass and some revolver
cartridges in the two trips they made. Altogether
it was lucky we got across at all.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It was a fortunate thing that this wind often blew quite
clear without snowfall or drift. Two days later in the same
gale the tent of the other three men collapsed on top of
them at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> At 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the sun was going down and they
settled to make their way across to their comrades. Levick
tells the story as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;Having done this [securing the remains of the tent,
etc.], we started on our journey. This lay, first of all,
across half a mile of clear blue ice, swept by the unbroken
wind, which met us almost straight in the face. We could
never stand up, so had to scramble the whole distance on
'all fours,' lying flat on our bellies in the gusts. By the
time we had reached the other side we had had enough.
Our faces had been rather badly bitten, and I have a very
strong recollection of the men's countenances, which were
a leaden blue, streaked with white patches of frost-bite.
Once across, however, we reached the shelter of some
large boulders on the shore of the island, and waited here
long enough to thaw out our noses, ears, and cheeks. A
scramble of another six hundred yards brought us to the
half-finished igloo, into which we found that the rest of the
party had barricaded themselves, and, after a little shouting,
they came and let us in, giving us a warm welcome,
and about the most welcome hot meal that I think any of
us had ever eaten.&quot;</p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-4.jpg"><img src="./images/1-4_th.jpg" alt="Priestley And Campbell" title="Priestley And Campbell" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Priestley And Campbell</span></p>
<hr />

<p><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv"></a></p>
<p>Priestley continues:</p>

<p>&quot;After the arrival of the evicted party we made hoosh,
and as we warmed up from the meal, we cheered up and
had one of the most successful sing-songs we had ever
had forgetting all our troubles for an hour or two. It is
a pleasing picture to look back upon now, and, if I close
my eyes, I can see again the little cave cut out in snow
and ice with the tent flapping in the doorway, barely
secured by ice-axe and shovel arranged crosswise against
the side of the shaft. The cave is lighted up with three or
four small blubber lamps, which give a soft yellow light.
At one end lie Campbell, Dickason and myself in our
sleeping-bags, resting after the day's work, and, opposite
to us, on a raised dais formed by a portion of the floor not
yet levelled, Levick, Browning and Abbott sit discussing
their seal hoosh, while the primus hums cheerily under the
cooker containing the coloured water which served with
us instead of cocoa. As the diners warm up jests begin to
fly between the rival tents and the interchange is brisk,
though we have the upper hand to-day, having an inexhaustible
subject in the recent disaster to their tent, and
their forced abandonment of their household gods. Suddenly
some one starts a song with a chorus, and the noise
from the primus is dwarfed immediately. One by one we
go through our favourites, and the concert lasts for a couple
of hours. By this time the lamps are getting low, and
gradually the cold begins to overcome the effects of the
hoosh and the cocoa. One after another the singers begin
to shiver, and all thoughts of song disappear as we realize
what we are in for. A night with one one-man bag between
two men! There is a whole world of discomfort in the
very thought, and no one feels inclined to jest about that
for the moment. Those jests will come all right to-morrow
when the night is safely past, but this evening it is anything
but a cheery subject of contemplation. There is no help for
it, however, and each of us prepares to take another man in
so far as he can.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In such spirit and under very similar conditions this
<a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi"></a>dauntless party set about passing through one of the most
horrible winters which God has invented. They were very
hungry, for the wind which kept the sea open also made
the shore almost impossible for seals. There were red-letter
days, however, such as when Browning found and
killed a seal, and in its stomach, &quot;not too far digested to be
still eatable,&quot; were thirty-six fish. And what visions of joy
for the future. &quot;We never again found a seal with an
eatable meal inside him, but we were always hoping to do
so, and a kill was, therefore, always a gamble. Whenever
a seal was sighted in future, some one said, 'Fish!' and
there was always a scramble to search the beast first.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>They ate blubber, cooked with blubber, had blubber
lamps. Their clothes and gear were soaked with blubber,
and the soot blackened them, their sleeping-bags, cookers,
walls and roof, choked their throats and inflamed their eyes.
Blubbery clothes are cold, and theirs were soon so torn as
to afford little protection against the wind, and so stiff with
blubber that they would stand up by themselves, in spite
of frequent scrapings with knives and rubbings with penguin
skins, and always there were underfoot the great
granite boulders which made walking difficult even in daylight
and calm weather. As Levick said, &quot;the road to hell
might be paved with good intentions, but it seemed probable
that hell itself would be paved something after the style
of Inexpressible Island.&quot;</p>

<p>But there were consolations; the long-waited-for lump
of sugar: the sing-songs&mdash;and about these there hangs
a story. When Campbell's Party and the remains of the
Main Party forgathered at Cape Evans in November
1912, Campbell would give out the hymns for Church.
The first Sunday we had 'Praise the Lord, ye heavens
adore Him,' and the second, and the third. We suggested
a change, to which Campbell asked, &quot;Why?&quot; We said
it got a bit monotonous. &quot;Oh no,&quot; said Campbell, &quot;we
always sang it on Inexpressible Island.&quot; It was also about
the only one he knew. Apart from this I do not know
whether 'Old King Cole' or the Te Deum was more
<a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii"></a>popular. For reading they had David Copperfield, the
Decameron, the Life of Stevenson and a New Testament.
And they did Swedish drill, and they gave lectures.</p>

<p>Their worst difficulties were scurvy<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and ptomaine
poisoning, for which the enforced diet was responsible.
From the first they decided to keep nearly all their unused
rations for sledging down the coast in the following spring,
and this meant that they must live till then on the seal and
penguin which they could kill. The first dysentery was
early in the winter, and was caused by using the salt from
the sea-water. They had some Cerebos salt, however, in
their sledging rations, and used it for a week, which stopped
the disorder and they gradually got used to the sea-ice salt.
Browning, however, who had had enteric fever in the past,
had dysentery almost continually right through the winter.
Had he not been the plucky, cheerful man he is, he would
have died.</p>

<p>In June again there was another bad attack of dysentery.
Another thing which worried them somewhat was
the 'igloo back,' a semi-permanent kink caused by seldom
being able to stand upright.</p>

<p>Then, in the beginning of September, they had ptomaine
poisoning from meat which had been too long in
what they called the oven, which was a biscuit box, hung
over the blubber stove, into which they placed the frozen
meat to thaw it out. This oven was found to be not quite
level, and in a corner a pool of old blood, water and scraps
of meat had collected. This and a tainted hoosh which
they did not have the strength of mind to throw away in
their hungry condition, seems to have caused the outbreak,
which was severe. Browning and Dickason were especially
bad.</p>

<p>They had their bad days: those first days of realization
that they would not be relieved: days of depression, disease
and hunger, all at once: when the seal seemed as if they
would give out and they were thinking they would have
to travel down the coast in the winter&mdash;but Abbott killed
<a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii"></a>two seals with a greasy knife, losing the use of three fingers
in the process, and saved the situation.</p>

<p>But they also had their good, or less-bad, days: such
was mid-winter night when they held food in their hands
and did not want to eat it, for they were full: or when they
got through the Te Deum without a hitch: or when they
killed some penguins; or got a ration of mustard plaster
from the medical stores.</p>

<p>Never was a more cheerful or good-tempered party.
They set out to see the humorous side of everything, and, if
they could not do so one day, at any rate they determined to
see to it the next. What is more they succeeded, and I have
never seen a company of better welded men than that which
joined us for those last two months in McMurdo Sound.</p>

<p>On September 30 they started home&mdash;so they called it.
This meant a sledge journey of some two hundred miles
along the coast, and its possibility depended upon the presence
of sea-ice, which we have seen to have been absent at
Evans Coves. It also meant crossing the Drygalski Ice
Tongue, an obstacle which bulked very formidably in their
imaginations during the winter. They reached the last rise
of this glacier in the evening of October 10, and then saw
Erebus, one hundred and fifty miles off. The igloo and the
past were behind: Cape Evans and the future were in
front&mdash;and the sea-ice was in as far as they could see.</p>

<p>Dickason was half crippled with dysentery when they
started, but improved. Browning, however, was still very
ill, but now they were able to eat a ration of four biscuits
a day and a small amount of pemmican and cocoa which
gave him a better chance than the continual meat. As they
neared Granite Harbour, a month after starting, his condition
was so serious that they discussed leaving him there
with Levick until they could get medicine and suitable food
from Cape Evans.</p>

<p>But their troubles were nearly over, for on reaching
Cape Roberts they suddenly sighted the dep&ocirc;t left by
Taylor in the previous year. They searched round, like
dogs, scratching in the drifts, and found&mdash;a whole case of
biscuits: and there were butter and raisins and lard. Day
<a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix"></a>and night merged into one long lingering feast, and when
they started on again their mouths were sore<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> with eating
biscuits. More, there is little doubt that the change of diet
saved Browning's life. As they moved down the coast they
found another dep&ocirc;t, and yet another. They reached Hut
Point on November 5.</p>

<p>The story of this, our Northern Party, has been told in
full by the two men most able to tell it: by Campbell in
the second volume of Scott's book, by Priestley in a separate
volume called Antarctic Adventure.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> I have added
only these few pages because, save in so far as their adventures
touch the Main Party or the Ship, it is better that I
should refer the reader to these two accounts than that I
should try and write again at second hand what has been
already twice told. I will only say here that the history of
what these men did and suffered has been overshadowed
by the more tragic tale of the Polar Party. They are not
men who wish for public applause, but that is no reason
why the story of a great adventure should not be known;
indeed, it is all the more reason why it should be known.
To those who have not read it I recommend Priestley's
book mentioned above, or Campbell's equally modest account
in Scott's Last Expedition.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The Terra Nova arrived at Cape Evans on January 18,
1913, just as we had started to prepare for another year.
And so the remains of the expedition came home that
spring. Scott's book was published in the autumn.</p>

<p>The story of Scott's Last Expedition of 1910-13 is
a book of two volumes, the first volume of which is Scott's
personal diary of the expedition, written from day to day
before he turned into his sleeping-bag for the night when
sledging, or in the intervals of the many details of organization
and preparation in the hut, when at Winter Quarters.
The readers of this book will probably have read that
diary and the accounts of the Winter Journey, the last
year, the adventures of Campbell's Party and the travels of
<a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx"></a>the Terra Nova which follow. With an object which I will
explain presently I quote a review of Scott's book from the
pen of one of Mr. Punch's staff:<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>&quot;There is courage and strength and loyalty and love
shining out of the second volume no less than out of the
first; there were gallant gentlemen who lived as well as
gallant gentlemen who died; but it is the story of Scott,
told by himself, which will give the book a place among
the great books of the world. That story begins in November
1910, and ends on March 29, 1912, and it is because
when you come to the end, you will have lived with Scott
for sixteen months, that you will not be able to read the
last pages without tears. That message to the public was
heartrending enough when it first came to us, but it was
as the story of how a great hero fell that we read it; now
it is just the tale of how a dear friend died. To have read
this book is to have known Scott; and if I were asked to
describe him, I think I should use some such words as
those which, six months before he died, he used of the
gallant gentleman who went with him, 'Bill' Wilson.
'Words must always fail when I talk of him,' he wrote;
'I believe he is the finest character I ever met&mdash;the closer
one gets to him the more there is to admire. Every quality
is so solid and dependable. Whatever the matter, one
knows Bill will be sound, shrewdly practical, intensely
loyal, and quite unselfish.' That is true of Wilson, if Scott
says so, for he knew men; but most of it is also true of
Scott himself. I have never met a more beautiful character
than that which is revealed unconsciously in these journals.
His humanity, his courage, his faith, his steadfastness,
above all, his simplicity, mark him as a man among men.
It is because of his simplicity that his last message, the last
entries in his diary, his last letters, are of such undying
beauty. The letter of consolation (and almost of apology)
which, on the verge of death, he wrote to Mrs. Wilson,
wife of the man dying at his side, may well be Scott's
monument. He could have no finer. And he has raised a
monument for those other gallant gentlemen who
died&mdash;<a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi"></a>Wilson,
Oates, Bowers, Evans. They are all drawn for us
clearly by him in these pages; they stand out unmistakably.
They, too, come to be friends of ours, their death
is as noble and as heartbreaking. And there were gallant
gentlemen, I said, who lived&mdash;you may read amazing
stories of them. Indeed, it is a wonderful tale of manliness
that these two volumes tell us. I put them down now; but
I have been for a few days in the company of the brave ... and
every hour with them has made me more proud for
those that died and more humble for myself.&quot;</p>

<p>I have quoted this review at length, because it gives the
atmosphere of hero-worship into which we were plunged
on our return. That atmosphere was very agreeable; but
it was a refracting medium through which the expedition
could not be seen with scientific accuracy&mdash;and the expedition
was nothing if not scientific. Whilst we knew
what we had suffered and risked better than any one else,
we also knew that science takes no account of such things;
that a man is no better for having made the worst journey
in the world; and that whether he returns alive or drops
by the way will be all the same a hundred years hence if his
records and specimens come safely to hand.</p>

<p>In addition to Scott's Last Expedition and Priestley's
Antarctic Adventures, Griffith Taylor, who was physiographer
to the Main Party, has written an account of the
two geological journeys of which he was the leader, and
of the domestic life of the expedition at Hut Point and at
Cape Evans, up to February 1912, in a book called With
Scott: The Silver Lining. This book gives a true glimpse
into the more boisterous side of our life, with much useful
information about the scientific part.</p>

<p>Though it bears little upon this book I cannot refrain
from drawing the reader's attention to, and earning some
of his thanks for, a little book called Antarctic Penguins,
written by Levick, the Surgeon of Campbell's Party. It
is almost entirely about Ad&eacute;lie penguins. The author
spent the greater part of a summer living, as it were, upon
sufferance, in the middle of one of the largest penguin
rookeries in the world. He has described the story of
<a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii"></a>their crowded life with a humour with which, perhaps, we
hardly credited him, and with a simplicity which many
writers of children's stories might envy. If you think
your own life hard, and would like to leave it for a short
hour I recommend you to beg, borrow or steal this tale,
and read and see how the penguins live. It is all quite
true.</p>

<p>So there is already a considerable literature about the
expedition, but no connected account of it as a whole.
Scott's diary, had he lived, would merely have formed the
basis of the book he would have written. As his personal
diary it has an interest which no other book could have had.
But a diary in this life is one of the only ways in which a
man can blow off steam, and so it is that Scott's book accentuates
the depression which used to come over him sometimes.</p>

<p>We have seen the importance which must attach to the
proper record of improvements, weights and methods of
each and every expedition. We have seen how Scott took
the system developed by the Arctic Explorers at the point
of development to which it had been brought by Nansen,
and applied it for the first time to Antarctic sledge travelling.
Scott's Voyage of the Discovery gives a vivid picture
of mistakes rectified, and of improvements of every kind.
Shackleton applied the knowledge they gained in his first
expedition, Scott in this, his second and last. On the whole
I believe this expedition was the best equipped there has
ever been, when the double purpose, exploratory and scientific,
for which it was organized, is taken into consideration.
It is comparatively easy to put all your eggs into
one basket, to organize your material and to equip and
choose your men entirely for one object, whether it be the
attainment of the Pole, or the running of a perfect series
of scientific observations. Your difficulties increase many-fold
directly you combine the one with the other, as was
done in this case. Neither Scott nor the men with him
would have gone for the Pole alone. Yet they considered
the Pole to be an achievement worthy of a great attempt,
and &quot;We took risks, we knew we took them; things have
<a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii"></a>come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for
complaint....&quot;</p>

<p>It is, it must be, of the first importance that a system, I
will not say perfected, but developed, to a pitch of high
excellence at such a cost should be handed down as completely
as possible to those who are to follow. I want to so
tell this story that the leader of some future Antarctic expedition,
perhaps more than one, will be able to take it up
and say: &quot;I have here the material from which I can order
the articles and quantities which will be wanted for so many
men for such and such a time; I have also a record of how
this material was used by Scott, of the plans of his journeys
and how his plans worked out, and of the improvements
which his parties were able to make on the spot or suggest
for the future. I don't agree with such and such, but this
is a foundation and will save me many months of work in
preparation, and give me useful knowledge for the actual
work of my expedition.&quot; If this book can guide the future
explorer by the light of the past, it will not have been
written in vain.</p>

<p>But this was not my main object in writing this book.
When I undertook in 1913 to write, for the Antarctic Committee,
an Official Narrative on condition that I was given
a free hand, what I wanted to do above all things was
to show what work was done; who did it; to whom the
credit of the work was due; who took the responsibility;
who did the hard sledging; and who pulled us through
that last and most ghastly year when two parties were
adrift, and God only knew what was best to be done;
when, had things gone on much longer, men would undoubtedly
have gone mad. There is no record of these
things, though perhaps the world thinks there is. Generally
as a mere follower, without much responsibility, and
often scared out of my wits, I was in the thick of it all, and
I know.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I could not reconcile a sincere personal
confession with the decorous obliquity of an Official Narrative;
and I found that I had put the Antarctic Committee
in a difficulty from which I could rescue them only by
<a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv"></a>taking the book off their hands; for it was clear that what
I had written was not what is expected from a Committee,
even though no member may disapprove of a word of it.
A proper Official Narrative presented itself to our imaginations
and sense of propriety as a quarto volume, uniform
with the scientific reports, dustily invisible on Museum
shelves, and replete with&mdash;in the words of my Commission&mdash;&quot;times
of starting, hours of march, ground and weather
conditions,&quot; not very useful as material for future Antarcticists,
and in no wise effecting any catharsis of the
writer's conscience. I could not pretend that I had fulfilled
these conditions; and so I decided to take the undivided
responsibility on my own shoulders. None the
less the Committee, having given me access to its information,
is entitled to all the credit of a formal Official Narrative,
without the least responsibility for the passages which
I have studied to make as personal in style as possible, so
that no greater authority may be attached to them than I
deserve.</p>

<p>I need hardly add that the nine years' delay in the appearance
of my book was caused by the war. Before I had
recovered from the heavy overdraft made on my strength
by the expedition I found myself in Flanders looking after
a fleet of armoured cars. A war is like the Antarctic in one
respect. There is no getting out of it with honour as long
as you can put one foot before the other. I came back
badly invalided; and the book had to wait accordingly.</p>

<p>Scott used to say that the worst part of an expedition was
over when the preparation was finished. So no doubt it
was with a sigh of relief that he saw the Terra Nova out
from Cardiff into the Atlantic on June 15, 1910. Cardiff
had given the expedition a most generous and enthusiastic
send-off, and Scott announced that it should be his first
port on returning to England. Just three years more and
the Terra Nova, worked back from New Zealand by Pennell,
reached Cardiff again on June 14, 1913, and paid off
there.</p>

<p>From the first everything was informal and most pleasant,
and those who had the good fortune to help in working
the ship out to New Zealand, under steam or sail, must,
in spite of five months of considerable discomfort and very
hard work, look back upon the voyage as one of the very
happiest times of the expedition. To some of us perhaps
the voyage out, the three weeks in the pack ice going
South, and the Robinson Crusoe life at Hut Point are the
pleasantest of many happy memories.</p>

<p>Scott made a great point that so far as was possible the
personnel of the expedition must go out with the Terra<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>
Nova. Possibly he gave instructions that they were to be
worked hard, and no doubt it was a good opportunity of
testing our mettle. We had been chosen out of 8000 volunteers,
executive officers, scientific staff, crew, and all.</p>

<p>We differed entirely from the crew of an ordinary merchant
ship both in our personnel and in our methods of
working. The executive officers were drawn from the
Navy, as were also the crew. In addition there was the
scientific staff, including one doctor who was not a naval
surgeon, but who was also a scientist, and two others called
by Scott 'adaptable helpers,' namely Oates and myself.
The scientific staff of the expedition numbered twelve
members all told, but only six were on board: the remainder
were to join the ship at Lyttelton, New Zealand, when we
made our final embarcation for the South. Of those on the
ship Wilson was chief of the scientific staff, and united in
himself the various functions of vertebral zoologist, doctor,
artist, and, as this book will soon show, the unfailing
friend-in-need of all on board. Lieutenant Evans was in
command, with Campbell as first officer. Watches were of
course assigned immediately to the executive officers. The
crew was divided into a port and starboard watch, and the
ordinary routine of a sailing ship with auxiliary steam was
followed. Beyond this no work was definitely assigned to
any individual on board. How the custom of the ship
arose I do not know, but in effect most things were done by
volunteer labour. It was recognized that every one whose
work allowed turned to immediately on any job which was
wanted, but it was an absolutely voluntary duty&mdash;Volunteers
to shorten sail? To coal? To shift cargo? To pump?
To paint or wash down paintwork? They were constant
calls&mdash;some of them almost hourly calls, day and night&mdash;and
there was never any failure to respond fully. This
applied not only to the scientific staff but also, whenever
their regular duties allowed, to the executive officers.
There wasn't an officer on the ship who did not shift coal
till he was sick of the sight of it, but I heard no complaints.
Such a system soon singles out the real willing
workers, but it is apt to put an undue strain upon them.<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>
Meanwhile most of the executive officers as well as the
scientific staff had their own work to do, which they were
left to fit in as most convenient.</p>

<p>The first days out from England were spent in such
hard and crowded work that we shook down very quickly.
I then noticed for the first time Wilson's great gift of tact,
and how quick he was to see the small things which make
so much difference. At the same time his passion for work
set a high standard. Pennell was another glutton.</p>

<p>We dropped anchor in Funchal Harbour, Madeira,
about 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on June 23, eight days out. The ship had
already been running under sail and steam, the decks were
as clear as possible, there was some paintwork to show, and
with a good harbour stow she looked thoroughly workmanlike
and neat. Some scientific work, in particular tow
netting and magnetic observations, had already been done.
But even as early as this we had spent hours on the pumps,
and it was evident that these pumps were going to be a
constant nightmare.</p>

<p>In Madeira, as everywhere, we were given freely of
such things as we required. We left in the early morning
of June 26, after Pennell had done some hours' magnetic
work with the Lloyd Creak and Barrow Dip Circle.</p>

<p>On June 29 (noon position lat. 27&deg; 10&acute; N., long. 20&deg;
21&acute; W.) it was possible to write: &quot;A fortnight out to-day,
and from the general appearance of the wardroom we might
have been out a year.&quot;</p>

<p>We were to a great extent strangers to one another when
we left England, but officers and crew settled down to
their jobs quickly, and when men live as close as we did
they settle down or quarrel before very long. Let us walk
into the cabins which surround the small wardroom aft.
The first on the left is that of Scott and Lieutenant Evans,
but Scott is not on board, and Wilson has taken his place.
In the next cabin to them is Drake, the secretary. On the
starboard side of the screw are Oates, Atkinson and Levick,
the two latter being doctors, and on the port side Campbell
and Pennell, who is navigator. Then Rennick and
Bowers, the latter just home from the Persian Gulf&mdash;both
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>of these are watchkeepers. In the next cabin are Simpson,
meteorologist, back from Simla, with Nelson and Lillie,
marine biologists. In the last cabin, the Nursery, are the
youngest, and necessarily the best behaved, of this community,
Wright, the physicist and chemist, Gran the Norwegian
ski-expert, and myself, Wilson's helper and assistant
zoologist. It is difficult to put a man down as performing
any special job where each did so many, but that
is roughly what we were.</p>

<p>Certain men already began to stand out. Wilson, with
an apparently inexhaustible stock of knowledge on little
things and big; always ready to give help, and always
ready with sympathy and insight, a tremendous worker,
and as unselfish as possible; a universal adviser. Pennell,
as happy as the day was long, working out sights, taking
his watch on the bridge, or if not on watch full of energy
aloft, trimming coal, or any other job that came along;
withal spending hours a day on magnetic work, which he
did as a hobby, and not in any way as his job. Bowers
was proving himself the best seaman on board, with an
exact knowledge of the whereabouts and contents of every
case, box and bale, and with a supreme contempt for heat
or cold. Simpson was obviously a first-class scientist, devoted
to his work, in which Wright gave him very great
and unselfish help, while at the same time doing much of
the ship's work. Oates and Atkinson generally worked together
in a solid, dependable and somewhat humorous way.</p>

<p>Evans, who will always be called Lieutenant Evans in
this book to distinguish him from Seaman Evans, was in
charge of the ship, and did much to cement together the
rough material into a nucleus which was capable of standing
without any friction the strains of nearly three years
of crowded, isolated and difficult life, ably seconded by
Victor Campbell, first officer, commonly called The Mate,
in whose hands the routine and discipline of the ship was
most efficiently maintained. I was very frightened of
Campbell.</p>

<p>Scott himself was unable to travel all the way out to
New Zealand in the Terra Nova owing to the business
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>affairs of the expedition, but he joined the ship from
Simon's Bay to Melbourne.</p>

<p>The voyage itself on the sailing track from Madeira to
the Cape was at first uneventful. We soon got into hot
weather, and at night every available bit of deck space was
used on which to sleep. The more particular slung hammocks,
but generally men used such deck space as they
could find, such as the top of the icehouse, where they were
free from the running tackle, and rolled themselves into
their blankets. So long as we had a wind we ran under sail
alone, and on those days men would bathe over the side
in the morning, but when the engines were going we could
get the hose in the morning, which was preferred, especially
after a shark was seen making for Bowers' red breast
as he swam.</p>

<p>The scene on deck in the early morning was always interesting.
All hands were roused before six and turned on
to the pumps, for the ship was leaking considerably. Normally,
the well showed about ten inches of water when the
ship was dry. Before pumping, the sinker would show anything
over two feet. The ship was generally dry after an
hour to an hour and a half's pumping, and by that time we
had had quite enough of it. As soon as the officer of the
watch had given the order, &quot;Vast pumping,&quot; the first
thing to do was to strip, and the deck was dotted with men
trying to get the maximum amount of water from the sea
in a small bucket let down on a line from the moving ship.
First efforts in this direction would have been amusing had
it not been for the caustic eye of the 'Mate' on the bridge.
If the reader ever gets the chance to try the experiment,
especially in a swell, he will soon find himself with neither
bucket nor water. The poor Mate was annoyed by the loss
of his buckets.</p>

<p>Everybody was working very hard during these days;
shifting coal, reefing and furling sail aloft, hauling on the
ropes on deck, together with magnetic and meteorological
observations, tow-netting, collecting and making skins
and so forth. During the first weeks there was more cargo
stowing and paintwork than at other times, otherwise the
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>work ran in very much the same lines all the way out&mdash;a
period of nearly five months. On July 1 we were overhauled
by the only ship we ever saw, so far as I can remember,
during all that time, the Inverclyde, a barque out from
Glasgow to Buenos Ayres. It was an oily, calm day with a
sea like glass, and she looked, as Wilson quoted, &quot;like a
painted ship upon a painted ocean,&quot; as she lay with all
sail set.</p>

<p>We picked up the N.E. Trade two days later, being
then north of the Cape Verde Islands (lat. 22&deg; 28&acute; N.,
long. 23&deg; 5&acute; W. at noon). It was a Sunday, and there was
a general 'make and mend' throughout the ship, the first
since we sailed. During the day we ran from deep clear
blue water into a darkish and thick green sea. This remarkable
change of colour, which was observed by the
Discovery Expedition in much the same place, was supposed
to be due to a large mass of pelagic fauna called
plankton. The plankton, which drifts upon the surface of
the sea, is distinct from the nekton, which swims submerged.
The Terra Nova was fitted with tow nets with very fine
meshes for collecting these inhabitants of the open sea, together
with the algae, or minute plant organisms, which
afford them an abundant food supply.</p>

<p>The plankton nets can be lowered when the ship is running
at full speed, and a great many such hauls were made
during the expedition.</p>

<p>July 5 had an unpleasant surprise in store. At 10.30
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the ship's bell rang and there was a sudden cry of
&quot;Fire quarters.&quot; Two Minimax fire extinguishers finished
the fire, which was in the lazarette, and was caused by a
lighted lamp which was upset by the roll of the ship. The
result was a good deal of smoke, a certain amount of water
below, and some singed paper, but we realized that a fire
on such an old wooden ship would be a very serious matter,
and greater care was taken after this.</p>

<p>Such a voyage shows Nature in her most attractive form,
and always there was a man close by whose special knowledge
was in the whales, porpoises, dolphins, fish, birds,
parasites, plankton, radium and other things which we
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>watched through microscopes or field-glasses. Nelson
caught a Portuguese man-of-war (Arethusa) as it sailed
past us close under the counter. These animals are common,
but few can realize how beautiful they are until they
see them, fresh-coloured from the deep sea, floating and
sailing in a big glass bowl. It vainly tried to sail out,
and vigorously tried to sting all who touched it. Wilson
painted it.</p>

<p>From first to last the study of life of all kinds was of
absorbing interest to all on board, and, when we landed in
the Antarctic, as well as on the ship, everybody worked
and was genuinely interested in all that lived and had its
being on the fringe of that great sterile continent. Not
only did officers who had no direct interest in anything
but their own particular work or scientific subject spend a
large part of their time in helping, making notes and keeping
observations, but the seamen also had a large share in
the specimens and data of all descriptions which have been
brought back. Several of them became good pupils for
skinning birds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, perhaps the constant cries of &quot;Whale,
whale!&quot; or &quot;New bird!&quot; or &quot;Dolphins!&quot; sometimes
found the biologist concerned less eager to leave his meal
than the observers were to call him forth. Good opportunities
of studying the life of sea birds, whales, dolphins
and other forms of life in the sea, even those comparatively
few forms which are visible from the surface, are
not too common. A modern liner moves so quickly that it
does not attract life to it in the same way as a slow-moving
ship like the Terra Nova, and when specimens are seen
they are gone almost as soon as they are observed. Those
who wish to study sea life&mdash;and there is much to be done
in this field&mdash;should travel by tramp steamers, or, better
still, sailing vessels.</p>

<p>Dolphins were constantly playing under the bows of
the ship, giving a very good chance for identification, and
whales were also frequently sighted, and would sometimes
follow the ship, as did also hundreds of sea birds, petrels,
shearwaters and albatross. It says much for the interest
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>and keenness of the officers on board that a complete hourly
log was kept from beginning to end of the numbers and
species which were seen, generally with the most complete
notes as to any peculiarity or habit which was noticed. It
is to be hoped that full use will be made, by those in charge
of the working out of these results, of these logs which were
kept so thoroughly and sometimes under such difficult circumstances
and conditions of weather and sea. Though
many helped, this log was largely the work of Pennell, who
was an untiring and exact observer.</p>

<p>We lost the N.E. Trade about July 7, and ran into the
Doldrums. On the whole we could not complain of the
weather. We never had a gale or big sea until after leaving
South Trinidad, and though an old ship with no modern
ventilation is bound to be stuffy in the tropics, we lived and
slept on deck so long as it was not raining. If it rained at
night, as it frequently does in this part of the world, a
number of rolled-up forms could be heard discussing as to
whether it was best to stick it above or face the heat below;
and if the rain persisted, sleepy and somewhat snappy individuals
were to be seen trying to force themselves and a
maximum amount of damp bedding down the wardroom
gangway. At the same time a thick wooden ship will keep
fairly cool in the not severe heat through which we passed.</p>

<p>One want which was unavoidable was the lack of fresh
water. There was none to wash in, though a glass of water
was allowed for shaving! With an unlimited amount of
sea water this may not seem much of a hardship; nor is it
unless you have very dirty work to do. But inasmuch as
some of the officers were coaling almost daily, they found
that any amount of cold sea water, even with a euphemistically
named 'sea-water soap,' had no very great effect in
removing the coal dust. The alternative was to make
friends with the engine-room authorities and draw some
water from the boilers.</p>

<p>Perhaps therefore it was not with purely disinterested
motives that some of us undertook to do the stoking during
the morning watch, and also later in the day during our
passage through the tropics, since the engine-room staff
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>was reduced by sickness. A very short time will convince
anybody that the ease with which men accustomed to this
work get through their watch is mainly due to custom and
method. The ship had no forced draught nor modern ventilating
apparatus. Four hours in the boiling fiery furnace
which the Terra Nova's stokehold formed in the tropics,
unless there was a good wind to blow down the one canvas
shaft, was a real test of staying power, and the actual shovelling
of the coal into the furnaces, one after the other,
was as child's play to handling the 'devil,' as the weighty
instrument used for breaking up the clinker and shaping
the fire was called. The boilers were cylindrical marine or
return tube boilers, the furnaces being six feet long by three
feet wide, slightly lower at the back than at the front. The
fire on the bars was kept wedge-shape, that is, some nine
inches high at the back, tapering to about six inches in front
against the furnace doors. The furnaces were corrugated
for strength. We were supposed to keep the pressure on
the gauge between 70 and 80, but it wanted some doing.
For the most part it was done.</p>

<p>We did, however, get uncomfortable days with the rain
sluicing down and a high temperature&mdash;everything wet
on deck and below. But it had its advantages in the fresh
water it produced. Every bucket was on duty, and the ship's
company stripped naked and ran about the decks or sat in
the stream between the laboratories and wardroom skylight
and washed their very dirty clothes. The stream came
through into our bunks, and no amount of caulking ever
stopped it. To sleep with a constant drip of water falling
upon you is a real trial. These hot, wet days were more
trying to the nerves than the months of wet, rough but
cooler weather to come, and it says much for the good
spirit which prevailed that there was no friction, though we
were crowded together like sardines in a tin.</p>

<p>July 12 was a typical day (lat. 4&deg; 57&acute; N., long. 22&deg;
4&acute; W.). A very hot, rainy night, followed by a squall which
struck us while we were having breakfast, so we went up
and set all sail, which took until about 9.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> We then
sat in the water on the deck and washed clothes until just
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>before mid-day, when the wind dropped, though the rain
continued. So we went up and furled all sail, a tedious
business when the sails are wet and heavy. Then work on
cargo or coal till 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, supper, and glad to get to sleep.</p>

<p>On July 15 (lat. 0&deg; 40&acute; N., long. 21&deg; 56&acute; W.) we crossed
the Line with all pomp and ceremony. At 1.15 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Neptune
in the person of Seaman Evans hailed and stopped
the ship. He came on board with his motley company, who
solemnly paced aft to the break of the poop, where he was
met by Lieutenant Evans. His wife (Browning), a doctor
(Paton), barber (Cheetham), two policemen and four bears,
of whom Atkinson and Oates were two, grouped themselves
round him while the barrister (Abbott) read an
address to the captain, and then the procession moved
round to the bath, a sail full of water slung in the break of
the poop on the starboard side.</p>

<p>Nelson was the first victim. He was examined, then
overhauled by the doctor, given a pill and a dose, and
handed over to the barber, who lathered him with a black
mixture consisting of soot, flour and water, was shaved by
Cheetham with a great wooden razor, and then the policemen
tipped him backwards into the bath where the bears
were waiting. As he was being pushed in he seized the
barber and took him with him.</p>

<p>Wright, Lillie, Simpson and Levick followed, with
about six of the crew. Finally Gran, the Norwegian, was
caught as an extra&mdash;never having been across the Line in
a British ship. But he threw the pill-distributing doctor
over his head into the bath, after which he was lathered
very gingerly, and Cheetham having been in once, refused
to shave him at all, so they tipped him in and wished they
had never caught him.</p>

<p>The procession re-formed, and Neptune presented certificates
to those who had been initiated. The proceedings
closed with a sing-song in the evening.</p>

<p>These sing-songs were of very frequent occurrence.
The expedition was very fond of singing, though there
was hardly anybody in it who could sing. The usual custom
at this time was that every one had to contribute a song
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>in turn all round the table after supper. If he could not
sing he had to compose a limerick. If he could not compose
a limerick he had to contribute a fine towards the wine
fund, which was to make some much-discussed purchases
when we reached Cape Town. At other times we played the
most childish games&mdash;there was one called 'The Priest
of the Parish has lost his Cap,' over which we laughed till
we cried, and much money was added to the wine fund.</p>

<p>As always happens, certain songs became conspicuous
for a time. One of these I am sure that Campbell, who was
always at work and upon whom the routine of the ship
depended, will never forget. I do not know who it was
that started singing</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Everybody works but Father,<br /></span>
<span>That poor old man,&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but Campbell, who was the only father on board and whose
hair was popularly supposed to be getting thin on the top
of his head, may remember.</p>

<p>We began to make preparations for a run ashore&mdash;a
real adventure on an uninhabited and unknown island.
The sailing track of ships from England round the Cape
of Good Hope lies out towards the coast of Brazil, and not
far from the mysterious island of South Trinidad, 680
miles east of Brazil, in 20&deg; 30&acute; S. and 29&deg; 30&acute; W.</p>

<p>This island is difficult of access, owing to its steep
rocky coast and the big Atlantic swell which seldom ceases.
It has therefore been little visited, and as it is infested with
land crabs the stay of the few parties which have been
there has been short. But scientifically it is of interest, not
only for the number of new species which may be obtained
there, but also for the extraordinary attitude of wild sea
birds towards human beings whom they have never learnt
to fear. Before we left England it had been decided to
attempt a landing and spend a day there if we should pass
sufficiently near to it.</p>

<p>Those who have visited it in the past include the astronomer
Halley, who occupied it, in 1700. Sir James Ross,
outward bound for the Antarctic in 1839, spent a day there,
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>landing &quot;in a small cove a short distance to the northward
of the Nine Pin Rock of Halley, the surf on all other parts
being too great to admit of it without hazarding the destruction
of our boats.&quot; Ross also writes that &quot;Horsburgh
mentions ... 'that the island abounds with wild pig and
goats; one of the latter was seen. With the view to add
somewhat to the stock of useful creatures, a cock and two
hens were put on shore; they seemed to enjoy the change,
and, I have no doubt, in so unfrequented a situation, and
so delightful a climate, will quickly increase in numbers.'
I am afraid we did not find any of their descendants, nor
those of the pig and goats.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> I doubt whether fowls would
survive the land crabs very long. There are many wild
birds on the island, however, which may feed the shipwrecked,
and also a dep&ocirc;t left by the Government for that
purpose. Another visitor was Knight, who wrote a book
called The Cruise of the Falcon, concerning his efforts to
discover the treasure which is said to have been left there.
Scott also visited it in the Discovery in 1901, when a new
petrel was found which was afterwards called '&#338;strelata
wilsoni,' after the same 'Uncle Bill' who was zoologist of
both Scott's Expeditions.</p>

<p>And so it came about that on the evening of July 25 we
furled sail and lay five miles from South Trinidad with all
our preparations made for a very thorough search of this
island of treasure. Everything was to be captured, alive
or dead, animal, vegetable or mineral.</p>

<p>At half-past five the next morning we were steaming
slowly towards what looked like a quite impregnable face
of rock, with bare cliffs standing straight out of the water,
which, luckily for us, was comparatively smooth. As we
coasted to try and find a landing-place the sun was rising
behind the island, which reaches to a height of two thousand
feet, and the jagged cliffs stood up finely against the rosy
sky.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-6.jpg"><img src="./images/1-6_th.jpg" alt="South Trinidad&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." title="South Trinidad&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">South Trinidad</span>&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del.</p>
<hr />


<p>We dropped our anchor to the south of the island and
a boat's crew left to prospect for a landing-place, whilst
Wilson seized the opportunity to shoot some birds as
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>specimens, including two species of frigate bird, and the
seamen caught some of the multitudinous fish. We also
fired shots at the sharks which soon thronged round the
ship, and about which we were to think more before the
day was done.</p>

<p>The boat came back with the news that a possible landing-place
had been found, and the landing parties got off
about 8.30. The landing was very bad&mdash;a ledge of rock
weathered out of the cliff to our right formed, as it were, a
staging along which it was possible to pass on to a steeply
shelving talus slope in front of us. The sea being comparatively
smooth, everybody was landed dry, with their
guns and collecting gear.</p>

<p>The best account of South Trinidad is contained in a
letter written by Bowers to his mother, which is printed
here. But some brief notes which I jotted down at the time
may also be of interest, since they give an account of a
different part of the island:</p>

<p>&quot;Having made a small dep&ocirc;t of cartridges, together
with a little fluffy tern and a tern's egg, which Wilson
found on the rocks, we climbed westward, round and up,
to a point from which we could see into the East Bay. This
was our first stand, and we shot several white-breasted
petrel (&#338;strelata trinitatis), and also black-breasted petrel
(&#338;strelata arminjoniana). Later on we got over the brow
of a cliff where the petrel were nesting. We took two nests,
on each of which a white-breasted and a black-breasted
petrel were paired. Wilson caught one in his hands and I
caught another on its nest; it really did not know whether
it ought to fly away or not. This gives rise to an interesting
problem, since these two birds have been classified as
different species, and it now looks as though they are the
same.</p>

<p>&quot;The gannets and terns were quite extraordinary, like
all the living things there. If you stay still enough the
terns perch on your head. In any case they will not fly off
the rocks till you are two or three feet away. Several gannets
were caught in the men's hands. All the fish which
the biologist collected to-day can travel quite fast on land.<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
When the Discovery was here Wilson saw a fish come out
of the sea, seize a land crab about eighteen inches away and
take it back into the water.</p>

<p>&quot;The land crabs were all over the place in thousands;
it seems probable that their chief enemies are themselves.
They are regular cannibals.</p>

<p>&quot;Then we did a real long climb northwards, over rocks
and tufty grass till 1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> From the point we had
reached we could see both sides of the island, and the
little Martin Vas islands in the distance.</p>

<p>&quot;We found lots of little tern and terns' eggs, lying out
on the bare rock with no nest at all. Hooper also brought
us two little gannets&mdash;all fluffy, but even at this age larger
than a rook. As we got further up we began to come across
the fossilized trees for which the island is well known.</p>

<p>&quot;Four or five Captain biscuits made an excellent lunch,
and afterwards we started to the real top of the island, a hill
rising to the west of us. It was covered with a high scrubby
bush and rocks, and was quite thick; in fact there was
more vegetation here than on all the rest we had seen, and
in making our way through it we had to keep calling in
order to keep touch with one another.</p>

<p>&quot;The tree ferns were numerous, but stunted. The gannets
were sleeping on the tops of the bushes, and some of
the crabs had climbed up the bushes and were sunning
themselves on the top. These crabs were round us in thousands&mdash;I
counted seven watching me out of one crack
between two rocks.</p>

<p>&quot;We sat down under the lee of the summit, and thought
it would not be bad to be thrown away on a desert island,
little thinking how near we were to being stranded, for a
time at any rate.</p>

<p>&quot;The crabs gathered round us in a circle, with their eyes
turning towards us&mdash;as if they were waiting for us to die to
come and eat us. One big fellow left his place in the circle
and waddled up to my feet and examined my boots. First
with one claw and then with the other he took a taste of
my boot. He went away obviously disgusted: one could
almost see him shake his head.<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></p>

<p>&quot;We collected, as well as our birds and eggs, some
spiders, very large grasshoppers, wood-lice, cockchafers,
with big and small centipedes. In fact, the place teemed
with insect life. I should add that their names are given
rather from the general appearance of the animals than
from their true scientific classes.</p>

<p>&quot;We had a big and fast scramble down, and about half
way, when we could watch the sea breaking on the rocks
far below, we saw that there was a bigger swell running.
It was getting late, and we made our way down as fast as
we could&mdash;denting our guns as we slipped on the rocks.</p>

<p>&quot;The lower we got the bigger the sea which had risen
in our absence appeared to be. No doubt it was the swell of
a big disturbance far away, and when we reached the d&eacute;bris
slope where we had landed, flanked by big cliffs, we found
everybody gathered there and the boats lying off&mdash;it being
quite impossible for them to get near the shore.</p>

<p>&quot;They had just got a life-line ashore on a buoy. Bowers
went out on to the rocks and secured it. We put our guns
and specimens into a pile, out of reach, as we thought, of
any possible sea. But just afterwards two very large waves
took us&mdash;we were hauling in the rope, and must have
been a good thirty feet above the base of the wave. It hit
us hard and knocked us all over the place, and wetted the
guns and specimens above us through and through.</p>

<p>&quot;We then stowed all gear and specimens well out of the
reach of the seas, and then went out through the surf one
by one, passing ourselves out on the line. It was ticklish
work, but Hooper was the only one who really had a bad
time. He did not get far enough out among the rocks
which fringed the steep slope from which he started as a
wave began to roll back. The next wave caught him and
crashed him back, and he let go of the line. He was under
quite a long time, and as the waves washed back all that
we could do was to try and get the line to him. Luckily
he succeeded in finding the slack of the line and got out.</p>

<p>&quot;When we first got down to the shore and things were
looking nasty, Wilson sat down on the top of a rock and
ate a biscuit in the coolest possible manner. It was an
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>example to avoid all panicking, for he did not want the
biscuit.</p>

<p>&quot;He remarked afterwards to me, apropos to Hooper,
that it was a curious thing that a number of men, knowing
that there was nothing they could do, could quietly watch a
man fighting for his life, and he did not think that any but
the British temperament could do so. I also found out later
that he and I had both had a touch of cramp while waiting
for our turn to swim out through the surf.&quot;</p>

<p>The following is Bowers' letter:</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<i>Sunday, 31st July.</i></p>

<p>&quot;The past week has been so crowded with incident,
really, that I don't know where to start. Getting to land
made me long for the mails from you, which are such a
feature of getting to port. However, the strange uninhabited
island which we visited will have to make up for
my disappointment till we get to Capetown&mdash;or rather
Simon's Town. Campbell and I sighted S. Trinidad from
the fore yardarm on 25th, and on 26th, at first thing in the
morning, we crept up to an anchorage in a sea of glass.
The S.E. Trades, making a considerable sea, were beating
on the eastern sides, while the western was like a mill-pond.
The great rocks and hills to over 2000 feet towered above
us as we went in very close in order to get our anchor down,
as the water is very deep to quite a short distance from the
shore. West Bay was our selection, and so clear was the
water that we could see the anchor at the bottom in 15
fathoms. A number of sharks and other fish appeared at
once and several birds. Evans wanted to explore, so Oates,
Rennick, Atkinson and myself went away with him&mdash;pulling
the boat. We examined the various landings and
found them all rocky and dangerous. There was a slight
surf although the sea looked like a mill-pond. We finally
decided on a previously unused place, which was a little
inlet among the rocks.</p>

<p>&quot;There was nothing but rock, but there was a little
nook where we decided to try and land. We returned to
breakfast and found that Wilson and Cherry-Garrard had
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>shot several Frigate and other birds from the ship, the
little Norwegian boat&mdash;called a Pram&mdash;being used to pick
them up. By way of explanation I may say that Wilson
is a specialist in birds and is making a collection for the
British Museum.</p>

<p>&quot;We all landed as soon as possible. Wilson and Garrard
with their guns for birds: Oates with the dogs, and Atkinson
with a small rifle: Lillie after plants and geological
specimens: Nelson and Simpson along the shore after sea
beasts, etc.: and last but not least came the entomological
party, under yours truly, with Wright and, later, Evans, as
assistants. Pennell joined up with Wilson, so altogether
we were ready to 'do' the island. I have taken over the
collection of insects for the expedition, as the other scientists
all have so much to do that they were only too glad to shove
the small beasts on me. Atkinson is a specialist in parasites:
it is called 'Helminthology.' I never heard that
name before. He turns out the interior of every beast that
is killed, and being also a surgeon, I suppose the subject
must be interesting. White terns abounded on the island.
They were ghost-like and so tame that they would sit on
one's hat. They laid their eggs on pinnacles of rock without
a vestige of nest, and singly. They looked just like
stones. I suppose this was a protection from the land-crabs,
about which you will have heard. The land-crabs
of Trinidad are a byword and they certainly deserve
the name, as they abound from sea-level to the top of
the island. The higher up the bigger they were. The
surface of the hills and valleys was covered with loose
boulders, and the whole island being of volcanic origin,
coarse grass is everywhere, and at about 1500 feet is an
area of tree ferns and subtropical vegetation, extending up
to nearly the highest parts. The withered trees of a former
forest are everywhere and their existence unexplained,
though Lillie had many ingenious theories. The island has
been in our hands, the Germans', and is now Brazilian.
Nobody has been able to settle there permanently, owing
to the land-crabs. These also exclude mammal life. Captain
Kidd made a treasure dep&ocirc;t there, and some five years
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>ago a chap named Knight lived on the island for six months
with a party of Newcastle miners&mdash;trying to get at it. He
had the place all right, but a huge landslide has covered up
three-quarters of a million of the pirate's gold. The land-crabs
are little short of a nightmare. They peep out at you
from every nook and boulder. Their dead staring eyes
follow your every step as if to say, 'If only you will drop
down we will do the rest.' To lie down and sleep on any
part of the island would be suicidal. Of course, Knight
had a specially cleared place with all sorts of precautions,
otherwise he would never have survived these beasts, which
even tried to nibble your boots as you stood&mdash;staring hard
at you the whole time. One feature that would soon send
a lonely man off his chump is that no matter how many are
in sight they are all looking at you, and they follow step
by step with a sickly deliberation. They are all yellow
and pink, and next to spiders seem the most loathsome
creatures on God's earth. Talking about spiders [Bowers
always had the greatest horror of spiders]&mdash;I have to collect
them as well as insects. Needless to say I caught them
with a butterfly net, and never touched one. Only five
species were known before, and I found fifteen or more&mdash;at
any rate I have fifteen for certain. Others helped me to
catch them, of course. Another interesting item to science
is the fact that I caught a moth hitherto unknown to exist
on the island, also various flies, ants, etc. Altogether it
was a most successful day. Wilson got dozens of birds, and
Lillie plants, etc. On our return to the landing-place we
found to our horror that a southerly swell was rolling in,
and great breakers were bursting on the beach. About
five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we all collected and looked at the whaler and
pram on one side of the rollers and ourselves on the other.
First it was impossible to take off the guns and specimens,
so we made them all up to leave for the morrow. Second,
a sick man had come ashore for exercise, and he could not
be got off: finally, Atkinson stayed ashore with him. The
breakers made the most awe-inspiring cauldron in our
little nook, and it meant a tough swim for all of us. Three
of us swam out first and took a line to the pram, and finally
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>we got a good rope from the whaler, which had anchored
well out, to the shore. I then man&oelig;uvred the pram, and
everybody plunged into the surf and hauled himself out
with the rope. All well, but minus our belongings, and got
back to the ship; very wet and ravenous was a mild way to
put it. During my 12 to 4 watch that night the surf roared
like thunder, and the ship herself was rolling like anything,
and looked horribly close to the shore. Of course she was
quite safe really. It transpired that Atkinson and the seaman
had a horrible night with salt water soaked food, and
the crabs and white terns which sat and watched them all
night, squawking in chorus whenever they moved. It
must have been horrible, though I would like to have
stayed, and had I known anybody was staying would have
volunteered. This with the noise of the surf and the cold
made it pretty rotten for them. In the morning, Evans,
Rennick, Oates and I, with two seamen and Gran, took
the whaler and pram in to rescue the maroons. At first we
thought we would do it by a rocket line to the end of the
sheer cliff. The impossibility of such an idea was at once
evident, so Gran and I went in close in the pram, and hove
them lines to get off the gear first. I found the spoon-shaped
pram a wonderful boat to handle. You could go in
to the very edge of the breaking surf, lifted like a cork on
top of the waves, and as long as you kept head to sea and
kept your own head, you need never have got on the rocks,
as the tremendous back-swish took you out like a shot
every time. It was quite exciting, however, as we would
slip in close in a lull, and the chaps in the whaler would
yell, 'Look out!' if a big wave passed them, in which case
you would pull out for dear life. Our first lines carried
away, and then, with others, Rennick and I this time took
the pram while Atkinson got as near the edge as safe to
throw us the gear. I was pulling, and by watching our
chances we rescued the cameras and glasses, once being
carried over 12 feet above the rocks and only escaping by
the back-swish. Then the luckiest incident of the day
occurred, when in a lull we got our sick man down, and I
jumped out, and he in, as I steadied the boat's stern. The
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>next minute the boat flew out on the back-wash with the
seaman absolutely dry, and I was of course enveloped in
foam and blackness two seconds later by a following wave.
Twice the day before this had happened, but this time for
a moment I thought, 'Where will my head strike?' as I
was like a feather in a breeze in that swirl. When I banked
it was about 15 feet above, and, very scratched and winded,
I clung on with my nails and scrambled up higher. The
next wave, a bigger one, nearly had me, but I was just too
high to be sucked back. Atkinson and I then started getting
the gear down, Evans having taken my place in the
pram. By running down between waves we hove some
items into the boat, including the guns and rifles, which I
went right down to throw. These were caught and put
into the boat, but Evans was too keen to save a bunch of
boots that Atkinson threw down, and the next minute the
pram passed over my head and landed high and dry, like
a bridge, over the rocks between which I was wedged. I
then scrambled out as the next wave washed her still higher,
right over and over, with Evans and Rennick just out in
time. The next wave&mdash;a huge one&mdash;picked her up, and
out she bumped over the rocks and out to sea she went,
water-logged, with the guns, fortunately, jammed under
the thwarts. She was rescued by the whaler, baled out, and
then Gran and one of the seamen manned her battered
remains again, and we, unable to save the gear otherwise,
lashed it to life-buoys, threw it into the sea and let it drift
out with the back-wash to be picked up by the pram.</p>

<p>&quot;Clothes, watches and ancient guns, rifles, ammunition,
birds (dead) and all specimens were, with the basket
of crockery and food, soaked with salt water. However,
the choice was between that or leaving them altogether, as
anybody would have said had they seen the huge rollers
breaking among the rocks and washing 30 to 40 feet up
with the spray; in fact, we were often knocked over and
submerged for a time, clinging hard to some rock or one
of the ropes for dear life. Evans swam off first. Then I
was about half an hour trying to rescue a hawser and some
lines entangled among the rocks. It was an amusing job.<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>
I would wait for a lull, run down and haul away, staying
under for smaller waves and running up the rocks like a
hare when the warning came from the boat that a series of
big ones were coming in. I finally rescued most of it&mdash;had
to cut off some and got it to the place opposite the boat,
and with Rennick secured it and sent it out to sea to be
picked up. My pair of brown tennis shoes (old ones) had
been washed off my feet in one of the scrambles, so I was
wearing a pair of sea-boots&mdash;Nelson's, I found&mdash;which,
fortunately for him, was one of the few pairs saved. The
pram came in, and waiting for a back-wash Rennick swam
off. I ran down after the following wave, and securing my
green hat, which by the bye is a most useful asset, struck
out through the boiling, and grabbed the pram safely as we
were lifted on the crest of an immense roller. However,
we were just beyond its breaking-point, so all was well,
and we arrived aboard after eight hours' wash and wetness,
and none the worse, except for a few scratches, and yours
truly in high spirits. We stayed there that night, and the
following, Thursday, morning left. Winds are not too
favourable so far, as we dropped the S.E. Trades almost
immediately, and these are the variables between the
Trades and the Westerlies. Still 2500 miles off our destination.
Evans has therefore decided to steer straight for
Simon's Town and miss out the other islands. It is a pity,
but as it is winter down here, and the worst month of the
year for storms at Tristan Da Cunha, it is perhaps just as
well. I am longing to get to the Cape to have your letters
and hear all about you. Except for the absence of news,
life aboard is much to be desired. I simply love it, and
enjoy every day of my existence here. Time flies like anything,
and though it must have been long to you, to us it
goes like the wind&mdash;so different to that fortnight on the
passage home from India.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>After the return of the boat's crew we left South Trinidad,
and the zoologists had a busy time trying to save as
many as possible of the bird skins which had been procured.
They skinned on all through the following night,
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>and, considering that the birds had been lying out in the
tropics for twenty-four hours soaked with sea-water and
had been finally capsized in the overturned boat, the result
was not so disappointing as was expected. But the eggs
and many other articles were lost. Since the black-breasted
and white-breasted petrels were seen flying and nesting
paired together, it is reasonable to suppose that their former
classification as two separate species will have to be revised.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving South Trinidad we picked up our first
big long swell, logged at 8, and began to learn that the Terra
Nova can roll as few ships can. This was followed by a
stiff gale on our port beam, and we took over our first green
seas. Bowers wrote home as follows:</p>

<p class="right"><i>August 7th, Sunday.</i></p>

<p>&quot;All chances of going to Tristan are over, and we are
at last booming along with strong Westerlies with the
enormous Southern rollers lifting us like a cork on their
crests. We have had a stiff gale and a very high sea, which
is now over, though it is still blowing a moderate gale, and
the usual crowd of Albatross, Mollymawks, Cape Hens,
Cape Pigeons, etc., are following us. These will be our
companions down to the South. Wilson's idea is that, as
the prevailing winds round the forties are Westerlies, these
birds simply fly round and round the world&mdash;via Cape
Horn, New Zealand and the Cape of Good Hope. We have
had a really good opportunity now of testing the ship's
behaviour, having been becalmed with a huge beam swell
rolling 35&deg; each way, and having stood out a heavy gale
with a high sea. In both she has turned up trumps, and
really I think a better little sea boat never floated. Compared
to the Loch Torridon&mdash;which was always awash in
bad weather&mdash;we are as dry as a cork, and never once
shipped a really heavy sea. Of course a wooden ship has
some buoyancy of herself, and we are no exception. We
are certainly an exception for general seaworthiness&mdash;if
not for speed&mdash;and a safer, sounder ship there could not
be. The weather is now cool too&mdash;cold, some people call
it. I am still comfortable in cotton shirts and whites, while
some are wearing Shetland gear. Nearly everybody is pro<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>vided
with Shetland things. I am glad you have marked
mine, as they are all so much alike. I am certainly as well
provided with private gear as anybody, and far better than
most, so, being as well a generator of heat in myself, I
should be O.K. in any temperature. By the bye Evans and
Wilson are very keen on my being in the Western Party,
while Campbell wants me with him in the Eastern Party.
I have not asked to go ashore, but am keen on anything
and am ready to do anything. In fact there is so much
going on that I feel I should like to be in all three places
at once&mdash;East, West and Ship.&quot;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Making Our Easting Down</span></h3>

<p><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Ten minutes to four, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>It is an oilskinned and dripping seaman, and the
officer of the watch, or his so-called snotty, as the case may
be, wakes sufficiently to ask:</p>

<p>&quot;What's it like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two hoops, sir!&quot; answers the seaman, and makes
his way out.</p>

<p>The sleepy man who has been wakened wedges himself
more securely into his six foot by two&mdash;which is all his
private room on the ship&mdash;and collects his thoughts, amid
the general hubbub of engines, screw and the roll of articles
which have worked loose, to consider how he will best prevent
being hurled out of his bunk in climbing down, and
just where he left his oilskins and sea-boots.</p>

<p>If, as is possible, he sleeps in the Nursery, his task
may not be so simple as it may seem, for this cabin, which
proclaims on one of the beams that it is designed to
accommodate four seamen, will house six scientists or
pseudo-scientists, in addition to a pianola. Since these
scientists are the youngest in the expedition their cabin is
named the Nursery.</p>

<p>Incidentally it forms also the gangway from the wardroom
to the engine-room, from which it is divided only by a
wooden door, which has a bad habit of swinging open and
shutting with the roll of the ship and the weight of the oilskins
hung upon it, and as it does so, wave upon wave, the
clatter of the engines advances and recedes.</p>

<p>If, however, it is the officer of the watch he will be in a
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>smaller cabin farther aft which he shares with one other
man only, and his troubles are simplified.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that the seams in the deck above have
travelled many voyages, and have been strained in addition
by the boat davits and deck-houses built on the poop, a
good deal of water from this part of the deck, which is
always awash in bad weather, finds its way below, that is
into the upper bunks of our cabins. In order that only a
minimum of this may find its way into our blankets a series
of shoots, invented and carefully tended by the occupants
of these bunks, are arranged to catch this water as it falls
and carry it over our heads on to the deck of the cabin.</p>

<p>Thus it is that when this sleepy officer or scientist clambers
down on to the deck he will, if he is lucky, find the
water there, instead of leaving it in his bunk. He searches
round for his sea-boots, gets into his oilskins, curses if the
strings of his sou'wester break as he tries to tie them extra
firmly round his neck, and pushes along to the open door
into the wardroom. It is still quite dark, for the sun does
not rise for another hour and a half, but the diminished
light from the swinging oil-lamp which hangs there shows
him a desolate early morning scene which he comes to hate&mdash;especially
if he is inclined to be sick.</p>

<p>As likely as not more than one sea has partially found
its way down during the night, and a small stream runs
over the floor each time the ship rolls. The white oilcloth
has slipped off the table, and various oddments, dirty cocoa
cups, ash-trays, and other litter from the night are rolling
about too. The tin cups and plates and crockery in the
pantry forrard of the wardroom come together with a sickening
crash.</p>

<p>The screw keeps up a ceaseless chonk-chonk-chonk
(pause), chonk-chonk-chonk (pause), chonk-chonk-chonk.</p>

<p>Watching his opportunity he slides down across the wet
linoleum to the starboard side, whence the gangway runs
up to the chart-house and so out on to the deck. Having
glanced at the barograph slung up in the chart-room, and
using all his strength to force the door out enough to
squeeze through, he scrambles out into blackness.<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></p>

<p>The wind is howling through the rigging, the decks are
awash. It is hard to say whether it is raining, for the spray
cut off by the wind makes rain a somewhat insignificant
event. As he makes his way up on to the bridge, not a very
lofty climb, he looks to see what sail is set, and judges so
far as he can the force of the wind.</p>

<p>Campbell, for he is the officer of the morning watch
(4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>-8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>) has a talk with the officer he is relieving,
Bowers. He is given the course, the last hour's reading
on the Cherub patent log trailing out over the stern, and
the experiences of the middle watch of the wind, whether
rising or falling or squalling, and its effect on the sails and
the ship. &quot;If you keep her on her present course, she's all
right, but if you try and bring her up any more she begins
to shake. And, by the way, Penelope wants to be called
at 4.30.&quot; Bowers' 'snotty,' who is Oates, probably makes
some ribald remarks, such as no midshipman should to a
full lieutenant, and they both disappear below. Campbell's
snotty, myself, appears about five minutes afterwards trying
to look as though some important duty and not bed
had kept him from making an earlier appearance. Meanwhile
the leading hand musters the watch on deck and
reports them all present.</p>

<p>&quot;How about that cocoa?&quot; says Campbell. Cocoa is a
useful thing in the morning watch, and Gran, who used to
be Campbell's snotty, and whose English was not then
perfect, said he was glad of a change because he &quot;did not
like being turned into a drumstick&quot; (he meant a domestic).</p>

<p>So cocoa is the word and the snotty starts on an adventurous
voyage over the deck to the galley which is forrard;
if he is unlucky he gets a sea over him on the way. Here
he finds the hands of the watch, smoking and keeping
warm, and he forages round for some hot water, which he
gets safely back to the pantry down in the wardroom.
Here he mixes the cocoa and collects sufficient clean mugs
(if he can find them), spoons, sugar and biscuits to go
round. These he carefully &quot;chocks off&quot; while he goes
and calls Wilson and gives him his share&mdash;for Wilson gets
up at 4.30 every morning to sketch the sunrise, work at his
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>scientific paintings and watch the sea-birds flying round
the ship. Then back to the bridge, and woe betide him
if he falls on the way, for then it all has to be done over
again.</p>

<p>Pennell, who sleeps under the chart table on the bridge,
is also fed and inquires anxiously whether there are any
stars showing. If there are he is up immediately to get an
observation, and then retires below to work it out and to
tabulate the endless masses of figures which go to make
up the results of his magnetic observations&mdash;dip, horizontal
force and total force of the magnetic needle.</p>

<p>A squall strikes the ship. Two blasts of the whistle
fetches the watch out, and &quot;Stand by topsail halyards,&quot;
&quot;In inner jib,&quot; sends one hand to one halyard, the midshipman
of the watch to the other, and the rest on to
foc'stle and to the jib downhaul. Down comes the jib and
the man standing by the fore topsail halyard, which is on
the weather side of the galley, is drenched by the crests of
two big seas which come over the rail.</p>

<p>But he has little time to worry about things like this,
for the wind is increasing and &quot;Let go topsail halyards&quot;
comes through the megaphone from the bridge, and he
wants all his wits to let go the halyard from the belaying-pins
and jump clear of the rope tearing through the block
as the topsail yard comes sliding down the mast.</p>

<p>&quot;Clew up&quot; is the next order, and then &quot;All hands
furl fore and main upper topsails,&quot; and up we go out on to
the yard. Luckily the dawn is just turning the sea grey
and the ratlines begin to show up in relief. It is far harder
for the first and middle watches, who have to go aloft in
complete darkness. Once on the yard you are flattened
against it by the wind. The order to take in sail always
fetches Pennell out of his chart-house to come and take a
hand.</p>

<p>The two sodden sails safely furled&mdash;luckily they are
small ones&mdash;the men reach the deck to find that the wind
has shifted a little farther aft and they are to brace round.
This finished, it is broad daylight, and the men set to work
to coil up preparatory to washing decks&mdash;not that this
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>would seem very necessary. Certainly there is no hose
wanted this morning, and a general kind of tidying up and
coiling down ropes is more what is done.</p>

<p>The two stewards, Hooper, who is to land with the
Main Party, and Neale, who will remain with the Ship's
Party, turn out at six and rouse the afterguard for the
pumps, a daily evolution, and soon an unholy din may be
heard coming up from the wardroom. &quot;Rouse and shine,
rouse and shine: show a leg, show a leg&quot; (a relic of the old
days when seamen took their wives to sea). &quot;Come on,
Mr. Nelson, it's seven o'clock. All hands on the pumps!&quot;</p>

<p>From first to last these pumps were a source of much
exercise and hearty curses. A wooden ship always leaks a
little, but the amount of water taken in by the Terra Nova
even in calm weather was extraordinary, and could not be
traced until the ship was dry-docked in Lyttelton, New
Zealand, and the forepart was flooded.</p>

<p>In the meantime the ship had to be kept as dry as possible,
a process which was not facilitated by forty gallons of
oil which got loose during the rough weather after leaving
South Trinidad, and found its way into the bilges. As we
found later, some never-to-be-sufficiently-cursed stevedore
had left one of the bottom boards only half-fitted into its
neighbours. In consequence the coal dust and small pieces
of coal, which was stowed in this hold, found their way into
the bilges. Forty gallons of oil completed the havoc and
the pumps would gradually get more and more blocked
until it was necessary to send for Davies, the carpenter,
to take parts of them to pieces and clear out the oily coal
balls which had stopped them. This pumping would sometimes
take till nearly eight, and then would always have
to be repeated again in the evening, and sometimes every
watch had to take a turn. At any rate it was good for our
muscles.</p>

<p>The pumps were placed amidships, just abaft the main
mast, and ran down a shaft adjoining the after hatch, which
led into the holds which were generally used for coal and
patent fuel. The spout of the pump opened about a foot
above the deck, and the plungers were worked by means of
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>two horizontal handles, much as a bucket is wound up on
the drum of a cottage well. Unfortunately, this part of the
main deck, which is just forward of the break of the poop,
is more subject to seas breaking inboard than any other
part of the ship, so when the ship was labouring the task of
those on the pump was not an enviable one. During the
big gale going South the water was up to the men's waists
as they tried to turn the handles, and the pumps themselves
were feet under water.</p>

<p>From England to Cape Town these small handles were a
great inconvenience. There was very much pumping to be
done and there were plenty of men to do it, but the handles
were not long enough to allow more than four men to each
handle. Also they gave no secure purchase when the ship
was rolling heavily, and when a big roll came there was
nothing to do but practically stop pumping and hold on,
or you found yourself in the scuppers.</p>

<p>At Cape Town a great improvement was made by extending
the crank handles right across the decks, the outside
end turning in a socket under the rail. Fourteen men
could then get a good purchase on the handles and pumping
became a more pleasant exercise and less of a nuisance.</p>

<p>Periodically the well was sounded by an iron rod being
lowered on the end of a rope, by which the part that came
up wet showed the depth of water left in the bilge. When
this had been reduced to about a foot in the well, the ship
was practically dry, and the afterguard free to bathe and
go to breakfast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hands of the watch had been employed
on ropes and sails as the wind made necessary, and, when
running under steam as well as sail, hoisting ashes up the
two shoots from the ash-pits of the furnaces to the deck,
whence they went into the ditch.</p>

<p>It is eight bells (8 o'clock) and the two stewards are
hurrying along the decks, hoping to get the breakfast
safely from galley to wardroom. A few naked officers are
pouring sea-water over their heads on deck, for we are
under sail alone and there is no steam to work the hose.
The watch keepers and their snotties of the night before
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>are tumbling out of their bunks, and a great noise of conversation
is coming from the wardroom, among which
some such remarks as: &quot;Give the jam a wind, Marie&quot;;
&quot;After you with the coffee&quot;; &quot;Push along the butter&quot;
are frequent. There are few cobwebs that have not been
blown away by breakfast-time.</p>

<p>Rennick is busy breakfasting preparatory to relieving
Campbell on the bridge. Meanwhile, the hourly and four-hourly
ship's log is being made up&mdash;force of the wind,
state of the sea, height of the barometer, and all the details
which a log has to carry&mdash;including a reading of the distance
run as shown by the patent log line&mdash;(many is the
time I have forgotten to take it just at the hour and have
put down what I thought it ought to be, and not what it
was).</p>

<p>The morning watch is finished.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is a yell from somewhere amidships&mdash;&quot;<span class="smcap">Steady</span>&quot;&mdash;a
stranger might have thought there was
something wrong, but it is a familiar sound, answered by
a &quot;<span class="smcap">Steady It Is</span>, Sir,&quot; from the man at the wheel, and an
anything but respectful, &quot;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;<span class="smcap">Steady</span>,&quot;
from everybody having breakfast. It is Pennell who has
caused this uproar. And the origin is as follows:</p>

<p>Pennell is the navigator, and the standard compass,
owing to its remoteness from iron in this position, is placed
on the top of the ice-house. The steersman, however, steers
by a binnacle compass placed aft in front of his wheel. But
these two compasses for various reasons do not read alike
at a given moment, while the standard is the truer of the
two.</p>

<p>At intervals, then, Pennell or the officer of the watch
orders the steersman to &quot;Stand by for a steady,&quot; and goes
up to the standard compass, and watches the needle. Suppose
the course laid down is S. 40 E. A liner would steer
almost true to this course unless there was a big wind or
sea. But not so the old Terra Nova. Even with a good
steersman the needle swings a good many degrees either
side of the S. 40 E. But as it steadies momentarily on the
exact course Pennell shouts his &quot;Steady,&quot; the steersman
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>reads just where the needle is pointing on the compass card
before him, say S. 47 E., and knows that this is the course
which is to be steered by the binnacle compass.</p>

<p>Pennell's yells were so frequent and ear-piercing that
he became famous for them, and many times in working
on the ropes in rough seas and big winds, we have been
cheered by this unmusical noise over our heads.</p>

<p>We left Simon's Bay on Friday, September 2, 'to make
our Easting down' from the Cape of Good Hope to New
Zealand, that famous passage in the Roaring Forties which
can give so much discomfort or worse to sailing ships on
their way.</p>

<p>South Africa had been hospitable. The Admiral Commanding
the Station, the Naval Dockyard, and H.M.S.
Mutine and H.M.S. Pandora, had been more than kind.
They had done many repairs and fittings for us and had
sent fatigue parties to do it, thus releasing men for a certain
amount of freedom on shore, which was appreciated
after some nine weeks at sea. I can remember my first long
bath now.</p>

<p>Scott, who was up country when we arrived, joined the
ship here, and Wilson travelled ahead of us to Melbourne
to carry out some expedition work, chiefly dealing with
the Australian members who were to join us in New
Zealand.</p>

<p>One or two of us went out to Wynberg, which Oates
knew well, having been invalided there in the South
African War with a broken leg, the result of a fight against
big odds when, his whole party wounded, he refused to
surrender. He told me later how he had thought he would
bleed to death, and the man who lay next to him was convinced
he had a bullet in the middle of his brain&mdash;he could
feel it wobbling about there! Just now his recollections
only went so far as to tell of a badly wounded Boer who lay
in the next bed to him when he was convalescent, and how
the Boer insisted on getting up to open the door for him
every time he left the ward, much to his own discomfort.</p>

<p>Otherwise the recollections which survive of South
Africa are an excellent speech made on the expedition by<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>
John Xavier Merriman, and the remark of a seaman who
came out to dinner concerning one John, the waiter, that
&quot;he moved about as quick as a piece of sticking-plaster!&quot;</p>

<p>Leaving Simon's Town at daybreak we did magnetic
work all day, sailing out from False Bay with a biggish
swell in the evening. We ran southerly in good weather
until Sunday morning, when the swell was logged at 8 and
the glass was falling fast. By the middle watch it was blowing
a full gale and for some thirty hours we ran under reefed
foresail, lower topsails and occasionally reefed upper topsails,
and many of us were sick.</p>

<p>Then after two days of comparative calm we had a most
extraordinary gale from the east, a thing almost unheard of
in these latitudes (38&deg; S. to 39&deg; S.). All that we could do
was to put the engines at dead slow and sail northerly as
close to the wind as possible. Friday night, September 9,
it blew force 10 in the night, and the morning watch was
very lively with the lee rail under water.</p>

<p>Directly after breakfast on Saturday, September 10, we
wore ship, and directly afterwards the gale broke and it was
raining, with little wind, during the day.</p>

<p>The morning watch had a merry time on Tuesday, September
13, when a fresh gale struck them while they were
squaring yards. So unexpected was it that the main yards
were squared and the fore were still round, but it did not
last long and was followed by two splendid days&mdash;fine
weather with sun, a good fair wind and the swell astern.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-7.jpg"><img src="./images/1-7_th.jpg" alt="The Roaring Forties&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." title="The Roaring Forties&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The Roaring Forties</span>&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del.</p>
<hr />


<p>The big swell which so often prevails in these latitudes
is a most inspiring sight, and must be seen from a comparatively
small ship like the Terra Nova for its magnitude
to be truly appreciated. As the ship rose on the crest of one
great hill of water the next big ridge was nearly a mile away,
with a sloping valley between. At times these seas are
rounded in giant slopes as smooth as glass; at others they
curl over, leaving a milk-white foam, and their slopes are
marbled with a beautiful spumy tracery. Very wonderful
are these mottled waves: with a following sea, at one
moment it seems impossible that the great mountain which
is overtaking the ship will not overwhelm her, at another
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>it appears inevitable that the ship will fall into the space
over which she seems to be suspended and crash into the
gulf which lies below.</p>

<p>But the seas are so long that they are neither dangerous
nor uncomfortable&mdash;though the Terra Nova rolled to an
extraordinary extent, quite constantly over 50&deg; each way,
and sometimes 55&deg;.</p>

<p>The cooks, however, had a bad time trying to cook for
some fifty hands in the little galley on the open deck.
Poor Archer's efforts to make bread sometimes ended in
the scuppers, and the occasional jangle of the ship's bell
gave rise to the saying that &quot;a moderate roll rings the bell,
and a big roll brings out the cook.&quot;</p>

<p>Noon on Sunday, September 18, found us in latitude
39&deg; 20&acute; S. and longitude 66&deg; 9&acute; E., after a very good run,
for the Terra Nova, of 200 miles in the last twenty-four
hours. This made us about two days' run from St. Paul,
an uninhabited island formed by the remains of an old
volcano, the crater of which, surrounded as it were by a
horse-shoe of land, forms an almost landlocked harbour.
It was hoped to make a landing here for scientific work,
but it is a difficult harbour to make. We ran another two
hundred miles on Monday, and on Tuesday all preparations
were made for the landing, with suitable equipment,
and we were not a little excited at the opportunity.</p>

<p>At 4.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the next morning all hands were turned
out to take in sail preparatory to rounding St. Paul which
was just visible. The weather was squally, but not bad.
By 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, however, it was blowing a moderate gale, and by
the time we had taken in all sail we had to give up hopes
of a landing. We were thoroughly sick of sails by the time
we finally reefed the foresail and ran before the wind under
this and lower topsails.</p>

<p>We passed quite close to the island and could see into
the crater, and the cliffs beyond which rose from it, covered
with greenish grass. There were no trees, and of birds we
only saw those which frequent these seas. We had hoped
to find penguins and albatross nesting on the island at this
time of the year, and this failure to land was most disap<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>pointing.
The island is 860 feet high, and, for its size,
precipitous. It extends some two miles in length and one
mile in breadth.</p>

<p>The following day all the afterguard were turned on to
shift coal. It should be explained that up to this time the
bunkers, which lay one on the port and the other on the
starboard side of the furnaces, had been entirely filled as
required by two or more officers who volunteered from day
to day.</p>

<p>We took on board 450 tons of Crown Patent Fuel at
Cardiff in June 1910. This coal is in the form of bricks,
and is most handy since it can be thrown by hand from the
holds through the bunker doors in the boiler-room bulkhead
which after a time was left higher than the sinking level
of the coal. The coal to be landed was this patent fuel, and
it was now decided to shift farther aft all the patent fuel
which was left, and stack it against the boiler-room bulkhead,
the coal which was originally there having been fed
to the furnaces. Thus the dust which was finding its way
through the floorboards, and choking the pumps, could
be swept up, and a good stow could be made preparatory
to the final fit-out in New Zealand, while the coal which
was to be taken on board at Lyttelton could be loaded
through the main hatch.</p>

<p>In the meantime the gale which had sprung up six days
before and prevented us landing had died down. After
leaving St. Paul we had let the fires out and run under sail
alone, and the following two days we ran 119 and 141
miles respectively, being practically becalmed at times on
the following day, and only running 66 miles.</p>

<p>By Tuesday night, September 27, we had finished the
coaling, and we celebrated the occasion by a champagne
dinner. At the same time we raised steam. Scott was
anxious to push on, and so indeed was everybody else.
But the wind was not disposed to help us, and headed us
a good deal during the next few days, and it was not until
October 2 that we were able to set all plain sail in the
morning watch.</p>

<p>This absence of westerly winds in a region in which
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>they are usually too strong for comfort was explained by
Pennell by a theory that we were travelling in an anticyclone,
which itself was travelling in front of a cyclone
behind us. We were probably moving under steam about
the same pace as the disturbance, which would average
some 150 miles a day.</p>

<p>From this may be explained many of the reports of continual
bad weather met by sailing ships and steamers in
these latitudes. If we had been a sailing ship without
auxiliary steam the cyclone would have caught us up, and
we should have been travelling with it, and consequently in
continual bad weather. On the other hand, a steamer pure
and simple would have steamed through good and bad
alike. But we, with our auxiliary steam, only made much
the same headway as the disturbance travelling in our
wake, and so remained in the anticyclone.</p>

<p>Physical observations were made on the outward voyage
by Simpson and Wright<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> into the atmospheric electricity
over the ocean, one set of which consisted of an inquiry
into the potential gradient, and observations were undertaken
at Melbourne for the determination of the absolute
value of the potential gradient over the sea.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Numerous
observations were also made on the radium content of the
atmosphere over the ocean, to be compared afterwards with
observations in the Antarctic air. The variations in radium
content were not large. Results were also obtained on the
voyage of the Terra Nova to New Zealand upon the subject
of natural ionization in closed vessels.</p>

<p>In addition to the work of the ship and the physical
work above mentioned, work in vertebrate zoology, marine
biology and magnetism, together with four-hourly observations
of the salinity and temperature of the sea, was carried
out during the whole voyage.</p>

<p>In vertebrate zoology Wilson kept an accurate record
of birds, and he and Lillie another record of whales and
dolphins. All the birds which could be caught, both at sea
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>and on South Trinidad Island, were skinned and made
up into museum specimens. They were also examined for
external and internal parasites by Wilson, Atkinson and
myself, as were also such fish and other animals as could be
caught, including flying fish, a shark, and last but not least,
whales in New Zealand.</p>

<p>The method of catching these birds may be worth describing.
A bent nail was tied to a line, the other end of
which was made fast to the halyards over the stern. Sufficient
length of line was allowed either to cause the nail to
just trail in the sea in the wake of the ship or for the line to
just clear the sea. Thus when the halyard was hoisted to
some thirty or forty feet above the deck, the line would be
covering a considerable distance of sea.</p>

<p>The birds flying round the ship congregate for the main
part in the wake, for here they find the scraps thrown overboard
on which they feed. I have seen six albatross all together
trying to eat up an empty treacle tin.</p>

<p>As they fly to and fro their wings are liable to touch the
line which is spread out over the sea. Sometimes they will
hit the line with the tips of their wings, and then there is
no resulting capture, but sooner or later a bird will touch
the line with the part of the wing above the elbow-joint
(humerus). It seems that on feeling the contact the bird
suddenly wheels in the air, thereby causing a loop in the
line which tightens round the bone. At any rate the next
thing that happens is that the bird is struggling on the line
and may be hauled on board.</p>

<p>The difficulty is to get a line which is light enough to
fly in the air, but yet strong enough to hold the large birds,
such as albatross, without breaking. We tried fishing line
with no success, but eventually managed to buy some 5-ply
extra strong cobbler's thread, which is excellent for the
purpose. But we wanted not only specimens, but also
observations of the species, the numbers which appeared,
and their habits, for little is known as yet of these sea birds.
And so we enlisted the help of all who were interested, and
it may be said that all the officers and many of the seamen
had a hand in producing the log of sea birds, to which addi<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>tions
were made almost hourly throughout the daylight
hours. Most officers and men knew the more common sea
birds in the open ocean, and certainly of those in the pack
and fringes of the Antarctic continent, which, with rare
exceptions, is the southern limit of bird life.</p>

<p>A number of observations of whales, illustrated by
Wilson, were made, but the results so far as the seas from
England to the Cape and New Zealand are concerned, are
not of great importance, partly because close views were
seldom obtained, and partly because the whales inhabiting
these seas are fairly well known. On October 3, 1910, in
latitude 42&deg; 17&acute; S. and longitude 111&deg; 18&acute; E., two adults
of Balaenoptera borealis (Northern Rorqual) were following
the ship close under the counter, length 50 feet, with a
light-coloured calf some 18-20 feet long swimming with
them. It was established by this and by a later observation
in New Zealand, when Lillie helped to cut up a similar
whale at the Norwegian Whaling Station at the Bay of
Islands, that this Rorqual which frequents the sub-Antarctic
seas is identical with our Northern Rorqual;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but this
was the only close observation of any whales obtained
before we left New Zealand.</p>

<p>General information with regard to such animals is
useful, however, as showing the relative abundance of
plankton on which the whales feed in the ocean. There are,
for instance, more whales in the Antarctic than in warmer
seas; and some whales at any rate (e.g. Humpback whales)
probably come north into warmer waters in the winter
rather for breeding purposes than to get food.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>With regard to dolphins four species were observed
beyond question. The rarest dolphin seen was Tersio
peronii, the peculiarity of which is that it has no dorsal fin.
This was seen on October 20, 1910, in latitude 42&deg; 51&acute; S.
and longitude 153&deg; 56&acute; E.</p>

<p>Reports of whales and dolphins which are not based
upon carcases and skeletons must be accepted with caution.
It is most difficult to place species with scientific accuracy
which can only be observed swimming in the water, and of
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>which more often than not only blows and the dorsal fins
can be observed. The nomenclature of dolphins especially
leaves much to be desired, and it is to be hoped that some
expedition in the future will carry a Norwegian harpooner,
who could do other work as well since they are very good
sailors. Wilson was strongly of this opinion and tried hard
to get a harpooner, but they are expensive people so long
as the present boom in whaling lasts, and perhaps it was on
the score of expense that the idea was regretfully abandoned.
We carried whaling gear formerly taken on the
Discovery Expedition, and kindly lent for this expedition
by the Royal Geographical Society of London. A few shots
were tried, but an unskilled harpooner stands very little
chance. If you go whaling you must have had experience.</p>

<p>The ship was not slowed down to enable marine biological
observations to be taken on this part of the expedition,
but something like forty samples of plankton were
taken with a full-speed net. We were unable to trawl on the
bottom until we reached Melbourne, when a trawl was
made in Port Phillip Harbour to try the gear and accustom
men to its use. It was not a purpose of the expedition to
spend time in deep-sea work until it reached Antarctic seas.</p>

<p>For four days the wind, such as there was of it, was
dead ahead; it is not very often in the Forties that a ship
cannot make progress for want of wind. But having set all
plain sail on October 2 with a falling glass we got a certain
amount of wind on the port beam, and did 158 miles in
the next twenty-four hours. Sunday being quiet Scott
read service while the officers and men grouped round
the wheel. We seldom had service on deck; for Sundays
became proverbial days for a blow on the way out, and
service, if held at all, was generally in the ward-room. On
one famous occasion we tried to play the pianola to accompany
the hymns, but, since the rolls were scored rather for
musical effect than for church services, the pianola was
suddenly found to be playing something quite different
from what was being sung. All through the expedition the
want of some one who could play the piano was felt, and
such a man is certainly a great asset in a life so far removed
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>from all the pleasures of civilization. As Scott wrote in
The Voyage of the Discovery, where one of the officers
used to play each evening: &quot;This hour of music has become
an institution which none of us would willingly forgo.
I don't know what thoughts it brings to others, though
I can readily guess; but of such things one does not care
to write. I can well believe, however, that our music
smooths over many a ruffle and brings us to dinner each
night in that excellent humour, where all seem good-tempered,
though 'cleared for action' and ready for fresh
argument.&quot;</p>

<p>The wind freshened to our joy; Scott was impatient;
there was much to be done and the time for doing it was
not too long, for it had been decided to leave New Zealand
at an earlier date than had been attempted by any previous
expedition, in order to penetrate the pack sooner and make
an early start on the dep&ocirc;t journey. The faintest glow of
the Aurora Australis which was to become so familiar to us
was seen at this time, but what aroused still more interest
was the capture of several albatross on the lines flowing out
over the stern.</p>

<p>The first was a 'sooty' (cornicoides). We put him
down on the deck, where he strutted about in the proudest
way, his feet going flop&mdash;flop&mdash;flop as he walked. He was
a most beautiful bird, sooty black body, a great black head
with a line of white over each eye and a gorgeous violet line
running along his black beak. He treated us with the
greatest contempt, which, from such a beautiful creature,
we had every appearance of deserving. Another day a little
later we caught a wandering albatross, a black-browed albatross,
and a sooty albatross all together, and set them on
the deck tethered to the ventilators while their photographs
were taken. They were such beautiful birds that we were
loath to kill them, but their value as scientific specimens
outweighed the wish to set them free, and we gave them
ether so that they did not suffer.</p>

<p>The Southern Ocean is the home of these and many
species of birds, but among them the albatross is pre-eminent.
It has been mentioned that Wilson believed that
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>the albatross, at any rate, fly round and round the world
over these stormy seas before the westerly winds, landing
but once a year on such islands as Kerguelen, St. Paul, the
Auckland Islands and others to breed. If so, the rest that
they can obtain upon the big breaking rollers which prevail
in these latitudes must be unsatisfactory judged by the
standard of more civilized birds. I have watched sea birds
elsewhere of which the same individuals appeared to follow
the ship day after day for many thousands of miles, but on
this voyage I came to the conclusion that a different set of
birds appeared each morning, and that they were hungry
when they arrived. Certainly they flew astern and nearer
to the ship in the morning, feeding on the scraps thrown
overboard. As the day went on and the birds' hunger was
satisfied, they scattered, and such of them as continued to
fly astern of the ship were a long way off. Hence we caught
the birds in the early morning, and only one bird was
caught after mid-day.</p>

<p>The wind continued favourable and was soon blowing
quite hard. On Friday, October 7, we were doing 7.8
knots under sail alone, which was very good for the old
Terra Push, as she was familiarly called: and we were then
just 1000 miles from Melbourne. By Saturday night we
were standing by topgallant halyards. Campbell took over
the watch at 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on Sunday morning. It was blowing
hard and squally, but the ship still carried topgallants.
There was a big following sea.</p>

<p>At 6.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> there occurred one of those incidents of
sea life which are interesting though not important. Quite
suddenly the first really big squall we had experienced on
the voyage struck us. Topgallant halyards were let go,
and the fore topgallant yard came down, but the main topgallant
yard jammed when only half down. It transpired
afterwards that a gasket which had been blown over the
yard had fouled the block of the sheet of the main upper
topsail. The topgallant yard was all tilted to starboard and
swaying from side to side, the sail seemed as though it
might blow out at any moment, and was making a noise
like big guns, and the mast was shaking badly.<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></p>

<p>It was expected that the topgallant mast would go, but
nothing could be done while the full fury of the wind
lasted. Campbell paced quietly up and down the bridge
with a smile on his face. The watch was grouped round
the ratlines ready to go aloft, and Crean volunteered to go
up alone and try and free the yard, but permission was
refused. It was touch and go with the mast and there was
nothing to be done.</p>

<p>The squall passed, the sail was freed and furled, and the
next big squall found us ready to lower upper topsails and
all was well. Finally the damage was a split sail and a
strained mast.</p>

<p>The next morning a new topgallant sail was bent, but
quite the biggest hailstorm I have ever seen came on in
the middle of the operation. Much of the hail must have
been inches in circumference, and hurt even through
thick clothes and oilskins. At the same time there were
several waterspouts formed. The men on the topgallant
yard had a beastly time. Below on deck men made hail-balls
and pretended they were snow.</p>

<p>From now onwards we ran on our course before a gale.
By the early morning of October 12 Cape Otway light was
in sight. Working double tides in the engine-room, and
with every stitch of sail set, we just failed to reach Port
Phillip Heads by mid-day, when the tide turned, and it
was impossible to get through. We went up Melbourne
Harbour that evening, very dark and blowing hard.</p>

<p>A telegram was waiting for Scott:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Madeira. Am going South. <span class="smcap">Amundsen</span>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>This telegram was dramatically important, as will appear
when we come to the last act of the tragedy. Captain Roald
Amundsen was one of the most notable of living explorers,
and was in the prime of life&mdash;forty-one, two years younger
than Scott. He had been in the Antarctic before Scott,
with the Belgica Expedition in 1897-99, and therefore did
not consider the South Pole in any sense our property.
Since then he had realized the dream of centuries of exploration
by passing through the North-West Passage,
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>and actually doing so in a 60-ton schooner in 1905. The
last we had heard of him was that he had equipped Nansen's
old ship, the Fram, for further exploration in the
Arctic. This was only a feint. Once at sea, he had told his
men that he was going south instead of north; and when
he reached Madeira he sent this brief telegram, which
meant, &quot;I shall be at the South Pole before you.&quot; It also
meant, though we did not appreciate it at the time, that
we were up against a very big man.</p>

<p>The Admiral Commanding the Australian Station came
on board. The event of the inspection was Nigger, the
black ship's cat, distinguished by a white whisker on the
port side of his face, who made one adventurous voyage
to the Antarctic and came to an untimely end during the
second. The seamen made a hammock for him with blanket
and pillow, and slung it forward among their own bedding.
Nigger had turned in, not feeling very well, owing
to the number of moths he had eaten, the ship being full
of them. When awakened by the Admiral, Nigger had
no idea of the importance of the occasion, but stretched
himself, yawned in the most natural manner, turned over
and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>This cat became a well-known and much photographed
member of the crew of the Terra Nova. He is said to
have imitated the Romans of old, being a greedy beast,
by having eaten as much seal blubber as he could hold,
made himself sick, and gone back and resumed his meal.
He had most beautiful fur. When the ship was returning
from the Antarctic in 1911 Nigger was frightened by
something on deck and jumped into the sea, which was
running fairly rough. However, the ship was hove to, a
boat lowered, and Nigger was rescued. He spent another
happy year on board, but disappeared one dark night when
the ship was returning from her second journey to the
South in 1912, during a big gale. He often went aloft
with the men, of his own accord. This night he was seen
on the main lower topsail yard, higher than which he never
would go. He disappeared in a big squall, probably because
the yard was covered with ice.<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></p>

<p>Wilson rejoined the ship at Melbourne; and Scott left
her, to arrange further business matters, and to rejoin in
New Zealand. When he landed I think he had seen enough
of the personnel of the expedition to be able to pass a
fair judgment upon them. I cannot but think that he
was pleased. Such enthusiasm and comradeship as prevailed
on board could bear only good fruit. It would certainly
have been possible to find a body of men who could
work a sailing ship with greater skill, but not men who
were more willing, and that in the midst of considerable
discomfort, to work hard at distasteful jobs and be always
cheerful. And it must have been clear that with all the
energy which was being freely expended, the expedition
came first, and the individual nowhere. It is to the honour
of all concerned that from the time it left London to the
time it returned to New Zealand after three years, this
spirit always prevailed.</p>

<p>Among the executive officers Scott was putting more
and more trust in Campbell, who was to lead the Northern
Party. He was showing those characteristics which enabled
him to bring his small party safely through one of the
hardest winters that men have ever survived. Bowers also
had shown seamanlike qualities which are an excellent test
by which to judge the Antarctic traveller; a good seaman
in sail will probably make a useful sledger: but at this time
Scott can hardly have foreseen that Bowers was to prove
&quot;the hardest traveller that ever undertook a Polar journey,
as well as one of the most undaunted.&quot; But he had already
proved himself a first-rate sailor. Among the junior scientific
staff too, several were showing qualities as seamen
which were a good sign for the future. Altogether I think
it must have been with a cheerful mind that Scott landed
in Australia.</p>

<p>When we left Melbourne for New Zealand we were
all a bit stale, which was not altogether surprising, and a
run ashore was to do us a world of good after five months
of solid grind, crowded up in a ship which thought nothing
of rolling 50&deg; each way. Also, though everything had been
done that could be done to provide them, the want of fresh
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>meat and vegetables was being felt, and it was an excellent
thing that a body of men, for whom every precaution
against scurvy that modern science could suggest was
being taken, should have a good course of antiscorbutic
food and an equally beneficial change of life before leaving
civilization.</p>

<p>And so it was with some anticipation that on Monday
morning, October 24, we could smell the land&mdash;New Zealand,
that home of so many Antarctic expeditions, where
we knew that we should be welcomed. Scott's Discovery,
Shackleton's Nimrod, and now again Scott's Terra Nova
have all in turn been berthed at the same quay in Lyttelton,
for aught I know at the same No. 5 Shed, into which
they have spilled out their holds, and from which they
have been restowed with the addition of all that New
Zealand, scorning payment, could give. And from there
they have sailed, and thither their relief ships have returned
year after year. Scott's words of the Discovery
apply just as much to the Terra Nova. Not only did New
Zealand do all in her power to help the expedition in an
official capacity, but the New Zealanders welcomed both
officers and men with open arms, and &quot;gave them to understand
that although already separated by many thousands
of miles from their native land, here in this new land they
would find a second home, and those who would equally
think of them in their absence, and welcome them on their
return.&quot;</p>

<p>But we had to sail round the southern coast of New
Zealand and northwards up the eastern coast before we
could arrive at our last port of call. The wind went ahead,
and it was not until the morning of October 28 that we
sailed through Lyttelton Heads. The word had gone forth
that we should sail away on November 27, and there was
much to be done in the brief month that lay ahead.</p>

<p>There followed four weeks of strenuous work into
which was sandwiched a considerable amount of play. The
ship was unloaded, when, as usual, men and officers acted
alike as stevedores, and she was docked, that an examination
for the source of the leak might be made by Mr. H. J.<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>
Miller of Lyttelton, who has performed a like service for
more than one Antarctic ship. But the different layers of
sheathing protecting a ship which is destined to fight
against ice are so complicated that it is a very difficult
matter to find the origin of a leak. All that can be said with
any certainty is that the point where the water appears
inside the skin of the ship is almost certainly not the locality
in which it has penetrated the outside sheathing. &quot;Our
good friend Miller,&quot; wrote Scott, &quot;attacked the leak and
traced it to the stern. We found the false stern split, and in
one case a hole bored for a long-stern through-bolt which
was much too large for the bolt.... The ship still leaks
but the water can now be kept under with the hand pump
by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty
minutes.&quot; This in Lyttelton; but in a not far distant
future every pump was choked, and we were baling with
three buckets, literally for our lives.</p>

<p>Bowers' feat of sorting and restowing not only the stores
we had but the cheese, butter, tinned foods, bacon, hams
and numerous other products which are grown in New
Zealand, and which any expedition leaving that country
should always buy there in preference to carrying them
through the tropics, was a masterstroke of clear-headedness
and organization. These stores were all relisted before
stowing and the green-banded or Northern Party and red-banded
or Main Party stores were not only easily distinguishable,
but also stowed in such a way that they were
forthcoming without difficulty at the right time and in
their due order.</p>

<p>The two huts which were to form the homes of our two
parties down South had been brought out in the ship and
were now erected on a piece of waste ground near, by the
same men who would be given the work to do in the South.</p>

<p>The gear peculiar to the various kinds of scientific work
which it was the object of the expedition to carry out was
also stowed with great care. The more bulky objects included
a petrol engine and small dynamo, a very delicate
instrument for making pendulum observations to test the
gravity of the earth, meteorological screens, and a Dines
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>anemometer. There was also a special hut for magnetic
observations, of which only the framework was finally taken,
with the necessary but bulky magnetic instruments. The
biological and photographic gear was also of considerable
size.</p>

<p>For the interior of the huts there were beds with spring
mattresses&mdash;a real luxury but one well worth the space and
money,&mdash;tables, chairs, cooking ranges and piping, and a
complete acetylene gas plant for both parties. There were
also extensive ventilators which were not a great success.
The problem of ventilation in polar regions still remains
to be solved.</p>

<p>Food can be packed into a comparatively small space,
but not so fuel, and this is one of the greatest difficulties
which confront the polar traveller. It must be conceded
that in this respect Norway, with her wonderful petrol-driven
Fram, is far ahead of us. The Terra Nova depended
on coal, and the length of the ship's stay in the
South, and the amount of exploration she could do after
landing the shore parties, depended almost entirely upon
how much coal she could be persuaded to hold after all
the necessaries of modern scientific exploration had been
wedged tightly into her.</p>

<p>The Terra Nova sailed from New Zealand with 425
tons of coal in her holds and bunkers, and 30 tons on deck
in sacks. We were to hear more of those sacks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile stalls were being built under the forecastle
for fifteen ponies, and, since room could not be found below
for the remaining four, stalls were built on the port side of
the fore hatch; the decks were caulked, and deck houses
and other fittings which might carry away in the stormy
seas of the South were further secured.</p>

<p>As the time of departure drew near, and each day of
civilization appeared to be more and more desirable, the
scene in Lyttelton became animated and congested. Here
is a scientist trying to force just one more case into his
small laboratory, or decanting a mass of clothing, just
issued, into the bottom of his bunk, to be slept on since
there was no room for it on the deck of his cabin. On the
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>main deck Bowers is trying to get one more frozen sheep
into the ice-house, in the rigging working parties are overhauling
the running gear. The engine-room staff are busy
on the engine, and though the ship is crowded there is
order everywhere, and it is clean.</p>

<p>But the scene on the morning of Saturday, November
26, baffles description. There is no deck visible: in addition
to 30 tons of coal in sacks on deck there are 2&frac12; tons of
petrol, stowed in drums which in turn are cased in wood.
On the top of sacks and cases, and on the roof of the ice-house
are thirty-three dogs, chained far enough apart to
keep them from following their first instinct&mdash;to fight the
nearest animal they can see: the ship is a hubbub of howls.
In the forecastle and in the four stalls on deck are the
nineteen ponies, wedged tightly in their wooden stalls, and
dwarfing everything are the three motor sledges in their
huge crates, 16&acute; x 5&acute; x 4&acute;, two of them on either side of the
main hatch, the third across the break of the poop. They
are covered with tarpaulins and secured in every possible
way, but it is clear that in a big sea their weight will throw
a great strain upon the deck. It is not altogether a cheerful
sight. But all that care and skill can do has been done to
ensure that the deck cargo will not shift, and that the
animals may be as sheltered as possible from wind and seas.
And it's no good worrying about what can't be helped.</p>

<p>Telegrams from all parts of the world, special trains, all
ships dressed, crowds and waving hands, steamers out to
the Heads and a general hullabaloo&mdash;these were the incidents
of Saturday, November 26, 1910, when we slipped
from the wharf at Lyttelton at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> We were to call at
Dunedin before leaving civilization, and arrived there on
Sunday night. Here we took on the remainder of our coal.
On Monday night we danced, in fantastic clothing for we
had left our grand clothes behind, and sailed finally for the
South the following afternoon amidst the greatest enthusiasm.
The wives remained with us until we reached the
open sea.</p>

<p>Amongst those who only left us at the last minute was
Mr. Kinsey of Christchurch. He acted for Scott in New
Zealand during the Discovery days, and for Shackleton in
1907. We all owe him a deep debt of gratitude for his
help. &quot;His interest in the expedition is wonderful, and
such interest on the part of a thoroughly shrewd business
man is an asset of which I have taken full advantage.
Kinsey will act as my agent in Christchurch during my
absence; I have given him an ordinary power of attorney,
and I think have left him in possession of all the facts. His
kindness to us was beyond words.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></p>

<p>&quot;Evening.&mdash;Loom of land and Cape Saunders Light
blinking.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The ponies and dogs were the first consideration. Even
in quite ordinary weather the dogs had a wretched time.
&quot;The seas continually break on the weather bulwarks and
scatter clouds of heavy spray over the backs of all who must
venture into the waist of the ship. The dogs sit with their
tails to this invading water, their coats wet and dripping.
It is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and
misery; occasionally some poor beast emits a long pathetic
whine. The group forms a picture of wretched dejection;
such a life is truly hard for these poor creatures.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The ponies were better off. Four of them were on deck
amidships and they were well boarded round. It is significant
that these ponies had a much easier time in rough
weather than those in the bows of the ship. &quot;Under the
forecastle fifteen ponies close side by side, seven one side,
eight the other, heads together, and groom between&mdash;swaying,
swaying continually to the plunging, irregular
motion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One takes a look through a hole in the bulkhead and
sees a row of heads with sad, patient eyes come swinging
up together from the starboard side, whilst those on the
port swing back; then up come the port heads, while the
starboard recede. It seems a terrible ordeal for these poor
beasts to stand this day after day for weeks together, and
indeed though they continue to feed well the strain quickly
drags down their weight and condition; but nevertheless
the trial cannot be gauged from human standards.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The seas through which we had to pass to reach the
pack-ice must be the most stormy in the world. Dante tells
us that those who have committed carnal sin are tossed
about ceaselessly by the most furious winds in the second
circle of Hell. The corresponding hell on earth is found
in the southern oceans, which encircle the world without
break, tempest-tossed by the gales which follow one another
round and round the world from West to East. You will
find albatross there&mdash;great Wanderers, and Sooties, and<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
Mollymawks&mdash;sailing as lightly before these furious winds
as ever do Paolo and Francesca. Round the world they go.
I doubt whether they land more than once a year, and then
they come to the islands of these seas to breed.</p>

<p>There are many other beautiful sea-birds, but most
beautiful of all are the Snowy petrels, which approach
nearer to the fairies than anything else on earth. They are
quite white, and seemingly transparent. They are the
familiar spirits of the pack, which, except to nest, they
seldom if ever leave, flying &quot;here and there independently
in a mazy fashion, glittering against the blue sky like so
many white moths, or shining snowflakes.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And then
there are the Giant petrels, whose coloration is a puzzle.
Some are nearly white, others brown, and they exhibit
every variation between the one and the other. And, on the
whole, the white forms become more general the farther
south you go. But the usual theory of protective coloration
will not fit in, for there are no enemies against which this
bird must protect itself. Is it something to do with radiation
of heat from the body?</p>

<p>A ship which sets out upon this journey generally has a
bad time, and for this reason the overladen state of the
Terra Nova was a cause of anxiety. The Australasian
meteorologists had done their best to forecast the weather
we must expect. Everything which was not absolutely
necessary had been ruthlessly scrapped. Yet there was not
a square inch of the hold and between-decks which was not
crammed almost to bursting, and there was as much on the
deck as could be expected to stay there. Officers and men
could hardly move in their living quarters when standing
up, and certainly they could not all sit down. To say that we
were heavy laden is a very moderate statement of the facts.</p>

<p>Thursday, December 1, we ran into a gale. We shortened
sail in the afternoon to lower topsails, jib and stay-sail.
Both wind and sea rose with great rapidity, and before
the night came our deck cargo had begun to work loose.
&quot;You know how carefully everything had been lashed, but
no lashings could have withstood the onslaught of these
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>coal sacks for long. There was nothing for it but to grapple
with the evil, and nearly all hands were labouring for hours
in the waist of the ship, heaving coal sacks overboard and
re-lashing the petrol cases, etc., in the best manner possible
under such difficult and dangerous circumstances. The
seas were continually breaking over these people and now
and again they would be completely submerged. At such
times they had to cling for dear life to some fixture to prevent
themselves being washed overboard, and with coal
bags and loose cases washing about, there was every risk of
such hold being torn away.</p>

<p>&quot;No sooner was some semblance of order restored than
some exceptionally heavy wave would tear away the lashing,
and the work had to be done all over again.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The conditions became much worse during the night
and things were complicated for some of us by sea-sickness.
I have lively recollections of being aloft for two hours in
the morning watch on Friday and being sick at intervals all
the time. For sheer downright misery give me a hurricane,
not too warm, the yard of a sailing ship, a wet sail and a
bout of sea-sickness.</p>

<p>It must have been about this time that orders were
given to clew up the jib and then to furl it. Bowers and
four others went out on the bowsprit, being buried deep in
the enormous seas every time the ship plunged her nose
into them with great force. It was an education to see him
lead those men out into that roaring inferno. He has left
his own vivid impression of this gale in a letter home. His
tendency was always to underestimate difficulties, whether
the force of wind in a blizzard, or the troubles of a polar
traveller. This should be remembered when reading the
vivid accounts which his mother has so kindly given me
permission to use:</p>

<p>&quot;We got through the forties with splendid speed and
were just over the fifties when one of those tremendous
gales got us. Our Lat. was about 52&deg; S., a part of the world
absolutely unfrequented by shipping of any sort, and as
we had already been blown off Campbell Island we had
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>nothing but a clear sweep to Cape Horn to leeward. One
realized then how in the Nimrod&mdash;in spite of the weather&mdash;they
always had the security of a big steamer to look to
if things came to the worst. We were indeed alone, by
many hundreds of miles, and never having felt anxious
about a ship before, the old whaler was to give me a new
experience.</p>

<p>&quot;In the afternoon of the beginning of the gale I helped
make fast the T.G. sails, upper topsails and foresail, and
was horrified on arrival on deck to find that the heavy
water we continued to ship, was starting the coal bags
floating in places. These, acting as battering-rams, tore
adrift some of my carefully stowed petrol cases and endangered
the lot. I had started to make sail fast at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and
it was 9.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> when I had finished putting on additional
lashings to everything I could. So rapidly did the sea get
up that one was continually afloat and swimming about. I
turned in for 2 hours and lay awake hearing the crash of
the seas and thinking how long those cases would stand it,
till my watch came at midnight as a relief. We were under
2 lower topsails and hove to, the engines going dead slow
to assist keeping head to wind. At another time I should
have been easy in my mind; now the water that came
aboard was simply fearful, and the wrenching on the old
ship was enough to worry any sailor called upon to fill his
decks with garbage fore and aft. Still 'Risk nothing and
do nothing,' if funds could not supply another ship, we
simply had to overload the one we had, or suffer worse
things down south. The watch was eventful as the shaking
up got the fine coal into the bilges, and this mixing with
the oil from the engines formed balls of coal and grease
which, ordinarily, went up the pumps easily; now however
with the great strains, and hundreds of tons on deck, as she
continually filled, the water started to come in too fast for
the half-clogged pumps to cope with. An alternative was
offered to me in going faster so as to shake up the big
pump on the main engines, and this I did&mdash;in spite of
myself&mdash;and in defiance of the first principles of seamanship.
Of course, we shipped water more and more, and
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>only to save a clean breach of the decks did I slow down
again and let the water gain. My next card was to get the
watch on the hand-pumps as well, and these were choked,
too, or nearly so.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyhow with every pump,&mdash;hand and steam,&mdash;going,
the water continued to rise in the stokehold. At 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> all
hands took in the fore lower topsail, leaving us under a
minimum of sail. The gale increased to storm force (force
11 out of 12) and such a sea got up as only the Southern
Fifties can produce. All the afterguard turned out and the
pumps were vigorously shaken up,&mdash;sickening work as
only a dribble came out. We had to throw some coal overboard
to clear the after deck round the pumps, and I set to
work to rescue cases of petrol which were smashed adrift.
I broke away a plank or two of the lee bulwarks to give the
seas some outlet as they were right over the level of the
rail, and one was constantly on the verge of floating clean
over the side with the cataract force of the backwash. I
had all the swimming I wanted that day. Every case I
rescued was put on the weather side of the poop to help get
us on a more even keel. She sagged horribly and the unfortunate
ponies,&mdash;though under cover,&mdash;were so jerked
about that the weather ones could not keep their feet in
their stalls, so great was the slope and strain on their forelegs.
Oates and Atkinson worked among them like Trojans,
but morning saw the death of one, and the loss of one
dog overboard. The dogs, made fast on deck, were washed
to and fro, chained by the neck, and often submerged for a
considerable time. Though we did everything in our power
to get them up as high as possible, the sea went everywhere.
The wardroom was a swamp and so were our bunks
with all our nice clothing, books, etc. However, of this we
cared little, when the water had crept up to the furnaces
and put the fires out, and we realized for the first time that
the ship had met her match and was slowly filling. Without
a pump to suck we started the forlorn hope of buckets
and began to bale her out. Had we been able to open a
hatch we could have cleared the main pump well at once,
but with those appalling seas literally covering her, it
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>would have meant less than 10 minutes to float, had we
uncovered a hatch.</p>

<p>&quot;The Chief Engineer (Williams) and carpenter (Davies),
after we had all put our heads together, started cutting a
hole in the engine room bulkhead, to enable us to get
into the pump-well from the engine room; it was iron
and, therefore, at least a 12 hours job. Captain Scott was
simply splendid, he might have been at Cowes, and to do
him and Teddy Evans credit, at our worst strait none of our
landsmen who were working so hard knew how serious
things were. Capt. Scott said to me quietly&mdash;'I am afraid
it's a bad business for us&mdash;What do you think?' I said
we were by no means dead yet, though at that moment,
Oates, at peril of his life, got aft to report another horse
dead; and more down. And then an awful sea swept away
our lee bulwarks clean, between the fore and main riggings,&mdash;only
our chain lashings saved the lee motor sledge then,
and I was soon diving after petrol cases. Captain Scott
calmly told me that they 'did not matter'&mdash;This was our
great project for getting to the Pole&mdash;the much advertised
motors that 'did not matter'; our dogs looked finished,
and horses were finishing, and I went to bale with a strenuous
prayer in my heart, and 'Yip-i-addy' on my lips, and
so we pulled through that day. We sang and re-sang every
silly song we ever knew, and then everybody in the ship
later on was put on 2-hour reliefs to bale, as it was impossible
for flesh to keep heart with no food or rest. Even the
fresh-water pump had gone wrong so we drank neat lime
juice, or anything that came along, and sat in our saturated
state awaiting our next spell. My dressing gown was my
great comfort as it was not very wet, and it is a lovely
warm thing.</p>

<p>&quot;To make a long yarn short, we found later in the day
that the storm was easing a bit and that though there was
a terrible lot of water in the ship, which, try as we could,
we could not reduce, it certainly had ceased to rise to any
great extent. We had reason to hope then that we might
keep her afloat till the pump wells could be cleared. Had
the storm lasted another day, God knows what our state
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>would have been, if we had been above water at all. You
cannot imagine how utterly helpless we felt in such a sea
with a tiny ship,&mdash;the great expedition with all its hopes
thrown aside for its life. God had shown us the weakness
of man's hand and it was enough for the best of us,&mdash;the
people who had been made such a lot of lately&mdash;the whole
scene was one of pathos really. However, at 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Evans
and I with the carpenter were able to crawl through a tiny
hole in the bulkhead, burrow over the coal to the pump-well
cofferdam, where, another hole having been easily
made in the wood, we got down below with Davy lamps
and set to work. The water was so deep that you had to
continually dive to get your hand on to the suction. After
2 hours or so it was cleared for the time being and the
pumps worked merrily. I went in again at 4.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and
had another lap at clearing it. Not till the afternoon of
the following day, though, did we see the last of the water
and the last of the great gale. During the time the pumps
were working, we continued the baling till the water got
below the furnaces. As soon as we could light up, we did,
and got the other pumps under weigh, and, once the ship
was empty, clearing away the suction was a simple matter.
I was pleased to find that after all I had only lost about 100
gallons of the petrol and bad as things had been they might
have been worse....</p>

<p>&quot;You will ask where all the water came from seeing
our forward leak had been stopped. Thank God we did
not have that to cope with as well. The water came chiefly
through the deck where the tremendous strain,&mdash;not only
of the deck load, but of the smashing seas,&mdash;was beyond
conception. She was caught at a tremendous disadvantage
and we were dependent for our lives on each plank standing
its own strain. Had one gone we would all have gone,
and the great anxiety was not so much the existing water as
what was going to open up if the storm continued. We
might have dumped the deck cargo, a difficult job at best,
but were too busy baling to do anything else....</p>

<p>&quot;That Captain Scott's account will be moderate you
may be sure. Still, take my word for it, he is one of the
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>best, and behaved up to our best traditions at a time when
his own outlook must have been the blackness of darkness....&quot;</p>

<p>Characteristically Bowers ends his account:</p>

<p>&quot;Under its worst conditions this earth is a good place
to live in.&quot;</p>

<p>Priestley wrote in his diary:</p>

<p>&quot;If Dante had seen our ship as she was at her worst, I
fancy he would have got a good idea for another Circle of
Hell, though he would have been at a loss to account for
such a cheerful and ribald lot of Souls.&quot;</p>

<p>The situation narrowed down to a fight between the incoming
water and the men who were trying to keep it in
check by baling her out. The Terra Nova will never be
more full of water, nearly up to the furnaces, than she was
that Friday morning, when we were told to go and do our
damndest with three iron buckets. The constructors had
not allowed for baling, only for the passage of one man at
a time up and down the two iron ladders which connected
the engine-room floor plates with the deck. If we used more
than three buckets the business of passing them rapidly up,
emptying them out of the hatchway, and returning them
empty, became unprofitable. We were divided into two
gangs, and all Friday and Friday night we worked two
hours on and two hours off, like fiends.</p>

<p>Wilson's Journal describes the scene:</p>

<p>&quot;It was a weird night's work with the howling gale and
the darkness and the immense seas running over the ship
every few minutes and no engines and no sail, and we all in
the engine-room oil and bilge water, singing chanties as we
passed up slopping buckets full of bilge, each man above
slopping a little over the heads of all below him; wet
through to the skin, so much so that some of the party
worked altogether naked like Chinese coolies; and the
rush of the wave backwards and forwards at the bottom
grew hourly less in the dim light of a couple of engine-room
oil lamps whose light just made the darkness visible, the
ship all the time rolling like a sodden lifeless log, her lee
gunwale under water every time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>There was one thrilling moment in the midst of the
worst hour on Friday when we were realizing that the fires
must be drawn, and when every pump had failed to act,
and when the bulwarks began to go to pieces and the petrol
cases were all afloat and going overboard, and the word was
suddenly passed in a shout from the hands at work in the
waist of the ship trying to save petrol cases that smoke was
coming up through the seams in the afterhold. As this was
full of coal and patent fuel and was next the engine-room,
and as it had not been opened for the airing it required to
get rid of gas, on account of the flood of water on deck
making it impossible to open the hatchway, the possibility
of a fire there was patent to every one, and it could not
possibly have been dealt with in any way short of opening
the hatches and flooding the ship, when she must have
foundered. It was therefore a thrilling moment or two
until it was discovered that the smoke was really steam,
arising from the bilge at the bottom having risen to the
heated coal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile men were working for all our lives to cut
through two bulkheads which cut off all communication
with the suction of the hand-pumps. One bulkhead was
iron, the other wood.</p>

<p>Scott wrote at this time:</p>

<p>&quot;We are not out of the wood, but hope dawns, as indeed
it should for me, when I find myself so wonderfully
served. Officers and men are singing chanties over their
arduous work. Williams is working in sweltering heat
behind the boiler to get the door made in the bulkhead.
Not a single one has lost his good spirits. A dog was
drowned last night, one pony is dead and two others in a
bad condition&mdash;probably they too will go. Occasionally a
heavy sea would bear one of them away, and he was only
saved by his chain. Meares with some helpers had constantly
to be rescuing these wretched creatures from hanging,
and trying to find them better shelter, an almost hopeless
task. One poor beast was found hanging when dead;
one was washed away with such force that his chain broke
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>and he disappeared overboard; the next wave miraculously
washed him on board again and he is fit and well.
[I believe the dog was Osman.] The gale has exacted
heavy toll, but I feel all will be well if we can only cope
with the water. Another dog has just been washed overboard&mdash;alas!
Thank God the gale is abating. The sea is
still mountainously high but the ship is not labouring so
heavily as she was.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The highest waves of which I can find any record were
36 feet high. These were observed by Sir James C. Ross in
the North Atlantic.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>On December 2 the waves were logged, probably by
Pennell, who was extremely careful in his measurements,
as being 'thirty-five feet high (estimated).' At one time I
saw Scott, standing on the weather rail of the poop, buried
to his waist in green sea. The reader can then imagine the
condition of things in the waist of the ship, &quot;over and over
again the rail, from the fore-rigging to the main, was
covered by a solid sheet of curling water which swept aft
and high on the poop.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> At another time Bowers and
Campbell were standing upon the bridge, and the ship
rolled sluggishly over until the lee combings of the main
hatch were under the sea. They watched anxiously, and
slowly she righted herself, but &quot;she won't do that often,&quot;
said Bowers. As a rule if a ship gets that far over she goes
down.</p>

<hr />

<p>Our journey was uneventful for a time, but of course it
was not by any means smooth. &quot;I was much disturbed
last night by the motion; the ship was pitching and twisting
with short sharp movements on a confused sea, and
with every plunge my thoughts flew to our poor ponies.
This afternoon they are fairly well, but one knows that
they must be getting weaker as time goes on, and one longs
to give them a good sound rest with a ship on an even keel.
Poor patient beasts! One wonders how far the memory of
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>such fearful discomfort will remain with them&mdash;animals so
often remember places and conditions where they have encountered
difficulties or hurt. Do they only recollect circumstances
which are deeply impressed by some shock of
fear or sudden pain, and does the remembrance of prolonged
strain pass away? Who can tell? But it would
seem strangely merciful if nature should blot out these
weeks of slow but inevitable torture.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>On December 7, noon position 61&deg; 22&acute; S., 179&deg; 56&acute; W.,
one berg was sighted far away to the west, as it gleamed
every now and then in the sun. Two more were seen the
next day, and at 6.22 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on December 9, noon position
65&deg; 8&acute; S., 177&deg; 41&acute; W., the pack was sighted ahead by Rennick.
All that day we passed bergs and streams of ice.
The air became dry and bracing, the sea was calm, and the
sun shining on the islands of ice was more than beautiful.
And then Bump! We had just charged the first big floe,
and we were in the pack.</p>

<p>&quot;The sky has been wonderful, with every form of cloud
in every condition of light and shade; the sun has continually
appeared through breaks in the cloudy heavens
from time to time, brilliantly illuminating some field of
pack, some steep-walled berg, or some patch of bluest sea.
So sunlight and shadow have chased each other across our
scene. To-night there is little or no swell&mdash;the ship is on
an even keel, steady, save for the occasional shocks on
striking ice.</p>

<p>&quot;It is difficult to express the sense of relief this steadiness
gives after our storm-tossed passage. One can only imagine
the relief and comfort afforded to the ponies, but the dogs
are visibly cheered and the human element is full of gaiety.
The voyage seems full of promise in spite of the imminence
of delay.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>We had met the pack farther north than any other
ship.</p>

<p>What is pack? Speaking very generally indeed, in this
region it is the sea-ice which forms over the Ross Sea area
during the winter, and is blown northwards by the southerly
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>blizzards. But as we shall see, the ice which forms over this
area is of infinite variety. As a rule great sheets spread
over the seas which fringe the Antarctic continent in the
autumn, grow thicker and thicker during the winter and
spring, and break up when the temperatures of sea and air
rise in summer. Such is the ice which forms in normal
seasons round the shores of McMurdo Sound, and up the
coast of the western mountains of Victoria Land. In sheltered
bays this ice will sometimes remain in for two years
or even more, growing all the time, until some phenomenal
break-up releases it. We found an example of this in the
sea-ice which formed between Hut Point and the Barrier.
But there are great waters which can never freeze for very
long. Cape Crozier, for instance, where the Emperor penguins
nest in winter, is one of the windiest places in the
world. In July it was completely frozen over as far as we
could see in the darkness from a height of 900 feet. Within
a few days a hurricane had blown it all away, and the sea
was black.</p>

<p>I believe, and we had experiences to prove me right, that
there is a critical period early in the winter, and that if sea-ice
has not frozen thick enough to remain fast by that time,
it is probable that the sea will remain open for the rest of
the year. But this does not mean that no ice will form. So
great is the wish of the sea to freeze, and so cold is the air,
that the wind has only to lull for one instant and the surface
is covered with a thin film of ice, as though by magic. But
the next blizzard tears it out by force or a spring tide
coaxes it out by stealth, whether it be a foot thick or only a
fraction of an inch. Such an example we had at our very
doors during our last winter, and the untamed winds which
blew as a result were atrocious.</p>

<p>Thus it is that floes from a few inches to twenty feet
thick go voyaging out to join the belt of ice which is known
as the pack. Scott seems to have thought that the whole
Ross Sea freezes over.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I myself think this doubtful, and I
am, I believe, the only person living who has seen the Ross
Sea open in mid-winter. This was on the Winter Journey
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>undertaken by Wilson, Bowers and myself in pursuit of
Emperor penguin eggs&mdash;but of that later.</p>

<p>It is clear that winds and currents are, broadly speaking,
the governing factors of the density of pack-ice. By experience
we know that clear water may be found in the autumn
where great tracts of ice barred the way in summer. The
tendency of the pack is northwards, where the ice melts
into the warmer waters. But the bergs remain when all
traces of the pack have disappeared, and, drifting northwards
still, form the menace to shipping so well known to
sailors rounding the Horn. It is not hard to imagine that
one monster ice island of twenty miles in length, such as
do haunt these seas, drifting into navigated waters and
calving into hundreds of great bergs as it goes, will in itself
produce what seamen call a bad year for ice. And the last
stages of these, when the bergs have degenerated into
'growlers,' are even worse, for then the sharpest eye can
hardly distinguish them as they float nearly submerged
though they have lost but little of their powers of evil.</p>

<p>There are two main types of Antarctic berg. The first
and most common is the tabular form. Bergs of this shape
cruise about in thousands and thousands. A less common
form is known as the pinnacled berg, and in almost every
case this is a tabular berg which has been weathered or has
capsized. The number of bergs which calve direct from a
mountain glacier into the sea is probably not very great.
Whence then do they come?</p>

<p>The origin of the tabular bergs was debated until a
few years ago. They have been recorded up to forty and
even fifty miles in length, and they have been called floe
bergs, because it was supposed that they froze first as
ordinary sea-ice and increased by subsequent additions
from below. But now we know that these bergs calve off
from the Antarctic Barriers, the largest of which is known
as the Great Ice Barrier, which forms the southern boundary
of the Ross Sea. We were to become very familiar
with this vast field of ice. We know that its northern face
is afloat, we guess that it may all be afloat. At any rate the
open sea now washes against its face at least forty miles
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>south of where it ran in the days of Ross. Though this
Barrier may be the largest in the world, it is one of many.
The most modern review of this mystery, Scott's article
on The Great Ice Barrier, must serve until the next first-hand
examination by some future explorer.</p>

<p>A berg shows only about one-eighth of its total mass
above water, and a berg two hundred feet high will therefore
reach approximately fourteen hundred feet below the
surface of the sea. Winds and currents have far more influence
upon them than they have upon the pack, through
which these bergs plough their way with a total disregard
for such flimsy obstacles, and cause much chaos as they go.
For the rest woe betide the ship which is so fixed into the
pack that she cannot move if one of these monsters bears
down upon her.</p>

<p>Words cannot tell the beauty of the scenes through
which we were to pass during the next three weeks. I suppose
the pack in winter must be a terrible place enough:
a place of darkness and desolation hardly to be found elsewhere.
But forms which under different conditions can
only betoken horror now conveyed to us impressions of the
utmost peace and beauty, for the sun had kissed them all.</p>

<p>&quot;We have had a marvellous day. The morning watch
was cloudy, but it gradually cleared until the sky was a brilliant
blue, fading on the horizon into green and pink. The
floes were pink, floating in a deep blue sea, and all the
shadows were mauve. We passed right under a monster
berg, and all day have been threading lake after lake and
lead after lead. 'There is Regent Street,' said somebody,
and for some time we drove through great streets of perpendicular
walls of ice. Many a time they were so straight
that one imagined they had been cut off with a ruler some
hundreds of yards in length.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>


<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-8.jpg"><img src="./images/1-8_th.jpg" alt="Midnight&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." title="Midnight&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Midnight</span>&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del.</p>
<hr />


<p>On another occasion:</p>

<p>&quot;Stayed on deck till midnight. The sun just dipped
below the southern horizon. The scene was incomparable.
The northern sky was gloriously rosy and reflected in the
calm sea between the ice, which varied from burnished
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>copper to salmon pink; bergs and pack to the north had
a pale greenish hue with deep purple shadows, the sky
shaded to saffron and pale green. We gazed long at these
beautiful effects.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>But this was not always so. There was one day with
rain, there were days of snow and hail and cold wet slush,
and fog. &quot;The position to-night is very cheerless. All
hope that this easterly wind will open the pack seems to
have vanished. We are surrounded with compacted floes
of immense area. Openings appear between these floes
and we slide crab-like from one to another with long delays
between. It is difficult to keep hope alive. There are
streaks of water sky over open leads to the north, but everywhere
to the south we have the uniform white sky. The
day has been overcast and the wind force 3 to 5 from the
E.N.E.&mdash;snow has fallen from time to time. There could
scarcely be a more dreary prospect for the eye to rest
upon.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>With the open water we left behind the albatross and
the Cape pigeon which had accompanied us lately for many
months. In their place we found the Antarctic petrel, &quot;a
richly piebald bird that appeared to be almost black and
white against the ice floes,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and the Snowy petrel, of
which I have already spoken.</p>

<p>No one of us whose privilege it was to be there will
forget our first sight of the penguins, our first meal of seal
meat, or that first big berg along which we coasted close
in order that London might see it on the film. Hardly had
we reached the thick pack, which prevailed after the
suburbs had been passed, when we saw the little Ad&eacute;lie
penguins hurrying to meet us. Great Scott, they seemed to
say, what's this, and soon we could hear the cry which we
shall never forget. &quot;Aark, aark,&quot; they said, and full of
wonder and curiosity, and perhaps a little out of breath,
they stopped every now and then to express their feelings,
&quot;and to gaze and cry in wonder to their companions; now
walking along the edge of a floe in search of a narrow spot
to jump and so avoid the water, and with head down and
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>much hesitation judging the width of the narrow gap, to
give a little standing jump across as would a child, and
running on the faster to make up for its delay. Again,
coming to a wider lead of water necessitating a plunge, our
inquisitive visitor would be lost for a moment, to reappear
like a jack-in-the-box on a nearer floe, where wagging his
tail, he immediately resumed his race towards the ship.
Being now but a hundred yards or so from us he pokes his
head constantly forward on this side and on that, to try and
make out something of the new strange sight, crying aloud
to his friends in his amazement, and exhibiting the most
amusing indecision between his desire for further investigation
and doubt as to the wisdom and propriety of closer
contact with so huge a beast.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>They are extraordinarily like children, these little people
of the Antarctic world, either like children, or like old men,
full of their own importance and late for dinner, in their
black tail-coats and white shirt-fronts&mdash;and rather portly
withal. We used to sing to them, as they to us, and you
might often see &quot;a group of explorers on the poop, singing
'She has rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, and
she shall have music wherever she goes,' and so on at
the top of their voices to an admiring group of Ad&eacute;lie
penguins.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Meares used to sing to them what he called 'God
save,' and declared that it would always send them headlong
into the water. He sang flat: perhaps that was why.</p>

<p>Two or more penguins will combine to push a third in
front of them against a skua gull, which is one of their
enemies, for he eats their eggs or their young if he gets the
chance. They will refuse to dive off an ice-foot until they
have persuaded one of their companions to take the first
jump, for fear of the sea-leopard which may be waiting in
the water below, ready to seize them and play with them
much as a cat will play with a mouse. As Levick describes
in his book about the penguins at Cape Adare: &quot;At the
place where they most often went in, a long terrace of ice
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>about six feet in height ran for some hundreds of yards
along the edge of the water, and here, just as on the sea-ice,
crowds would stand near the brink. When they had succeeded
in pushing one of their number over, all would
crane their necks over the edge, and when they saw the
pioneer safe in the water, the rest followed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>It is clear then that the Ad&eacute;lie penguin will show
a certain spirit of selfishness in tackling his hereditary
enemies. But when it comes to the danger of which he is
ignorant his courage betrays want of caution. Meares and
Dimitri exercised the dog-teams out upon the larger floes
when we were held up for any length of time. One day a
team was tethered by the side of the ship, and a penguin
sighted them and hurried from afar off. The dogs became
frantic with excitement as he neared them: he supposed it
was a greeting, and the louder they barked and the more
they strained at their ropes, the faster he bustled to meet
them. He was extremely angry with a man who went and
saved him from a very sudden end, clinging to his trousers
with his beak, and furiously beating his shins with his flippers.
It was not an uncommon sight to see a little Ad&eacute;lie
penguin standing within a few inches of the nose of a dog
which was almost frantic with desire and passion.</p>

<p>The pack-ice is the home of the immature penguins,
both Emperor and Ad&eacute;lie. But we did not see any large
numbers of immature Emperors during this voyage.</p>

<p>We soon became acquainted with the sea-leopard,
which waits under the ice-foot for the little penguins; he
is a brute, but sinuous and graceful as the seal world goes.
He preys especially upon the Ad&eacute;lie penguin, and Levick
found no less than eighteen penguins, together with the
remains of many others, in the stomach of one sea-leopard.
In the water the leopard seems &quot;a trifle faster than the
Ad&eacute;lies, as one of them occasionally would catch up with
one of the fugitives, who then, realizing that speed alone
would not avail him, started dodging from side to side, and
sometimes swam rapidly round and round in a circle of
about twelve feet diameter for a full minute or more, doubt<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>less
knowing that he was quicker in turning than his great
heavy pursuer, but exhaustion would overtake him in the
end, and we could see the head and jaws of the great
sea-leopard rise to the surface as he grabbed his victim.
The sight of a panic-stricken little Ad&eacute;lie tearing round
and round in this manner was sadly common late in the
season.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Fish and small seal have also been found in its stomach.
With long powerful head and neck and a sinuous body, it
is equipped with most formidable teeth with which it tears
strips out of the still living birds, and flippers which are
adapted entirely for speed in the water. It is a solitary
animal with a large range of distribution. It has been supposed
to bring forth its young in the pack, but nothing
definite is known on this subject. One day we saw a big
sea-leopard swimming along with the ship. He dived
under the floes and reappeared from floe to floe as we went,
and for a time we thought he was interested in us. But
soon we sighted another lying away on a floe, and our
friend in the water began to rear his head up perpendicularly,
and seemed to be trying to wind his mate, as we
supposed. He was down wind from her, and appeared to
find her at a distance of 150 to 200 yards, and the last we saw
of him he was heading up the side of the floe where she lay.</p>

<p>There are four kinds of seal in the Antarctic; of one of
these, the sea-leopard, I have already spoken. Another is
called the Ross seal, for Sir James Ross discovered it in
1840. It seems to be a solitary beast, living in the pack, and
is peculiar for its &quot;pug-like expression of countenance.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
It has always been rare, and no single specimen was seen
on this expedition, though the Terra Nova must have
passed through more pack than most whalers see in a life-time.
It looks as if the Ross seal is more rare than was
supposed.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-9.jpg"><img src="./images/1-9_th.jpg" alt="A Sea Leopard" title="A Sea Leopard" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">A Sea Leopard</span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-10.jpg"><img src="./images/1-10_th.jpg" alt="A Weddell Seal" title="A Weddell Seal" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">A Weddell Seal</span></p>
<hr />


<p>The very common seal of the Antarctic is the Weddell,
which seldom lives in the pack but spends its life catching
fish close to the shores of the continent, and digesting
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>them, when caught, lying sluggishly upon the ice-foot. We
came to know them later in their hundreds in McMurdo
Sound, for the Weddell is a land-loving seal and is only
found in large numbers near the coast. Just at this time it
was the crab-eating seal which we saw very fairly often,
generally several of them together, but never in large
numbers.</p>

<p>Wilson has pointed out in his article upon seals in
the Discovery Report<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that the Weddell and the crab-eater
seal, which are the two commoner of the Antarctic
seals, have agreed to differ both in habit and in diet, and
therefore they share the field successfully. He shows that
&quot;the two penguins which share the same area have differentiated
in a somewhat similar manner.&quot; The Weddell
seal and the Emperor penguin &quot;have the following points
in common, namely, a littoral distribution, a fish diet and
residential non-migratory habit, remaining as far south the
whole year round as open water will allow; whereas the
other two (the crab-eating seal and the Ad&eacute;lie penguin)
have in common a more pelagic habit, a crustacean diet,
and a distribution definitely migratory in the case of the
penguin, and although not so definitely migratory in the
case of the seal, yet checked from coming so far south as
Weddell's seal in winter by a strong tendency to keep in
touch with pelagic ice.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Wilson considers that the advantage
lies in each case with the &quot;non-migratory and more
southern species,&quot; <i>i.e.</i> the Weddell seal and the Emperor
penguin. I doubt whether he would confirm this now.
The Emperor penguin, weighing six stones and more,
seems to me to have a very much harder fight for life than
the little Ad&eacute;lie.</p>

<p>Before the Discovery started from England in 1901
an 'Antarctic Manual' was produced by the Royal Geographical
Society, giving a summary of the information
which existed up to that date about this part of the world.
It is interesting reading, and to the Antarctic student it
proves how little was known in some branches of science
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>at that date, and what strides were made during the next
few years. To read what was known of the birds and beasts
of the Antarctic and then to read Wilson's Zoological Report
of the Discovery Expedition is an education in what
one man can still do in an out-of-the-way part of the world
to elucidate the problems which await him.</p>

<p>The teeth of a crab-eating seal &quot;are surmounted by
perhaps the most complicated arrangement of cusps found
in any living mammal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The mouth is so arranged that
the teeth of the upper jaw fit into those of the lower, and
&quot;the cusps form a perfect sieve ... a hitherto unparalleled
function for the teeth of a mammal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The food of this
seal consists mainly of Euphausiae, animals much like
shrimps, which it doubtless keeps in its mouth while it
expels the water through its teeth, like those whales which
sift their food through their baleen plates.&quot; This development
of cusps in the teeth of the [crab-eating seal] is
probably a more perfect adaptation to this purpose than in
any other mammal, and has been produced at the cost of
all usefulness in the teeth as grinders. The grit, however,
which forms a fairly constant part of the contents of the
stomach and intestines, serves, no doubt, to grind up the
shells of the crustaceans, and in this way the necessity for
grinders is completely obviated.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The sea-leopard has a very formidable set of teeth suitable
for his carnivorous diet. The Weddell, living on fish,
has a more simple group, but these are liable to become
very worn in old age, due to his habit of gnawing out holes
in the ice for himself, so graphically displayed on Ponting's
cinematograph. When he feels death approaching, the
crab-eating seal, never inclined to live in the company of
more than a few of his kind, becomes still more solitary.
The Weddell seal will travel far up the glaciers of South
Victoria Land, and there we have found them lying dead.
But the crab-eating seal will wander even farther. He
leaves the pack. &quot;Thirty miles from the sea-shore and
3000 feet above sea-level, their carcases were found on
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>quite a number of occasions, and it is hard to account for
such vagaries on other grounds than that a sick animal will
go any distance to get away from its companions&quot;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> (and
perhaps it should be added from its enemies).</p>

<p>Often the under sides of the floes were coloured a
peculiar yellow. This coloration is caused by minute unicellular
plants called diatoms. The floating life of the Antarctic
is most dense. &quot;Diatoms were so abundant in parts
of the Ross Sea, that a large plankton net (18 meshes to an
inch) became choked in a few minutes with them and other
members of the Phytoplankton. It is extremely probable
that in such localities whales feed upon the plants as well
as the animals of the plankton.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> I do not know to what
extent these open waters are frequented by whales during
the winter, but in the summer months they are full of
them, right down to the fringe of the continent. Most
common of all is the kind of sea-wolf known as the Killer
Whale, who measures 30 feet long. He hunts in packs up
to at least a hundred strong, and as we now know, he does
not confine his attacks to seal and other whales, but will
also hunt man, though perhaps he mistakes him for a
seal. This whale is a toothed beast and a flesh-eater, and
is more properly a dolphin. But it seems that there are at
least five or six other kinds of whales, some of which do
not penetrate south of the pack, while others cruise in
large numbers right up to the edge of the fast ice. They
feed upon the minute surface life of these seas, and large
numbers of them were seen not only by the Terra Nova
on her various cruises, but also by the shore parties in the
waters of McMurdo Sound. In both Wilson and Lillie
we had skilled whale observers, and their work has gone
far to elucidate the still obscure questions of whale distribution
in the South.</p>

<p>The pack-ice offers excellent opportunities for the identification
of whales, because their movements are more restricted
than in the open ocean. In order to identify, the
observer generally has only the blow, and then the shape of
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>the back and fin as the whale goes down, to guide him. In
the pack he sometimes gets more, as in the case of Balaenoptera
acutorostrata (Piked whale) on March 3, 1911.
The ship &quot;was ploughing her way through thick pack-ice,
in which the water was freezing between the floes, so that
the only open spaces for miles around were those made by
the slow movement of the ship. We saw several of these
whales during the day, making use of the holes in the ice
near the ship for the purpose of blowing. There was
scarcely room between the floes for the whales to come up
to blow in their usual manner, which consists in rising
almost horizontally, and breaking the surface of the water
with their backs. On this occasion they pushed their snouts
obliquely out of the water, nearly as far as the eye, and
after blowing, withdrew them below the water again. Commander
Pennell noted that several times one rested its
head on a floe not twenty feet from the ship, with its nostrils
just on the water-line; raising itself a few inches, it
would blow and then subside again for a few minutes to its
original position with its snout resting on the floe. They
took no notice of pieces of coal which were thrown at them
by the men on board the ship.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>But no whale which we saw in the pack, and we often
saw it elsewhere also, was so imposing as the great Blue
whale, some of which were possibly more than 100 feet
long. &quot;We used to watch this huge whale come to the
surface again and again to blow, at intervals of thirty to
forty seconds, and from the fact that at each of four or five
appearances no vestige of a dorsal fin was visible, we began
to wonder whether we had not found the Right whale that
was once reported to be so abundant in Ross Sea. Again
and again the spout went up into the cold air, a white
twelve-foot column of condensed moisture, followed by a
smooth broad back, and yet no fin. For some time we remained
uncertain as to its identity, till at last in sounding
for a longer disappearance and a greater depth than usual,
the hinder third of the enormous beast appeared above the
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>surface for the first time with its little angular dorsal fin,
at once dispelling any doubts we might have had.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>It is supposed to be the largest mammal that has ever
existed.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> As it comes up to blow, &quot;one sees first a small
dark hump appear and then immediately a jet of grey fog
squirted upwards fifteen to eighteen feet, gradually spreading
as it rises vertically into the frosty air. I have been
nearly in these blows once or twice and had the moisture in
my face with a sickening smell of shrimpy oil. Then the
hump elongates and up rolls an immense blue-grey or
blackish-grey round back with a faint ridge along the top,
on which presently appears a small hook-like dorsal fin, and
then the whole sinks and disappears.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>To the biologist the pack is of absorbing interest. If
you want to see life, naked and unashamed, study the
struggles of this ice-world, from the diatom in the ice-floe
to the big killer whale; each stage essential to the life of
the stage above, and living on the stage below:</p>

</div></div>

<p>We were early on the scene compared with previous
expeditions, but I do not suppose this alone can explain the
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>extremely heavy ice conditions we met. Possibly we were
too far east. Our progress was very slow, and often we
were hung up for days at a time, motionless and immovable,
the pack all close about us. Patience and always more
patience! &quot;From the masthead one can see a few patches
of open water in different directions, but the main outlook
is the same scene of desolate hummocky pack.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And
again: &quot;We have scarcely moved all day, but bergs which
have become quite old friends are on the move, and one
has approached and almost circled us.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>And then without warning and reason, as far as we could
see, it would open out again, and broad black leads and
lakes would appear where there had been only white snow
and ice before, and we would make just a few more miles,
and sometimes we would raise steam only to suffer further
disappointment. Generally speaking, a dark black sky
means open water, and this is known as an open-water sky;
high lights in the sky mean ice, and this is known as ice-blink.</p>

<p>The changes were as sudden as they were unexpected.
Thus early in the morning of Christmas Eve, about a fortnight
after we had entered the pack, &quot;we have come into a
region of where the open water exceeds the ice; the former
lies in great irregular pools three or four miles or more
across and connecting with many leads. The latter&mdash;and
the fact is puzzling&mdash;still contain floes of enormous dimensions;
we have just passed one which is at least two miles
in diameter....&quot; And then, &quot;Alas! alas! at 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> this
morning we were brought up with a solid sheet of pack
extending in all directions, save that from which we had
come.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Delay was always irksome to Scott. As time went on
this waiting in the pack became almost intolerable. He
began to think we might have to winter in the pack. And
all the time our scanty supply of coal was being eaten up,
until it was said that Campbell's party would never be
taken to King Edward VII.'s Land. Scott found decisions
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>to bank fires, to raise steam or to let fires out, most difficult
at this time. &quot;If one lets fires out it means a dead loss of
over two tons, when the boiler has to be heated again.
But this two tons would only cover a day under banked
fires, so that for anything longer than twenty-four hours it
is economy to put the fires out. At each stoppage one is
called upon to decide whether it is to be for more or less
than twenty-four hours.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Certainly England should have
an oil-driven ship for polar work.</p>

<p>The Terra Nova proved a wonderfully fine ice ship.
Bowers' middle watch especially became famous for the way
in which he put the ship at the ice, and more than once
Scott was alarmed by the great shock and collisions which
were the result: I have seen him hurry up from his cabin
to put a stop to it! But Bowers never hurt the ship, and
she gallantly responded to the calls made upon her. Sometimes
it was a matter of forcing two floes apart, at others
of charging and breaking one. Often we went again and
again at some stubborn bit, backing and charging alternately,
as well as the space behind us would allow. If
sufficient momentum was gained the ship rode upon the
thicker floes, rising up upon it and pressing it down beneath
her, until suddenly, perhaps when its nearest edge
was almost amidships, the weight became too great and
the ice split beneath us. At other times a tiny crack, no
larger than a vein, would run shivering from our bows,
which widened and widened until the whole ship passed
through without difficulty. Always when below one heard
the grumbling of the ice as it passed along the side. But
it was slow work, and hard on the engines. There were
days when we never moved at all.</p>

<p>&quot;I can imagine few things more trying to the patience
than the long wasted days of waiting. Exasperating as it is
to see the tons of coal melting away with the smallest mileage
to our credit, one has at least the satisfaction of active
fighting and the hope of better fortune. To wait idly is the
worst of conditions. You can imagine how often and how
restlessly we climbed to the crow's nest and studied the
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>outlook. And strangely enough there was generally some
change to note. A water lead would mysteriously open up
a few miles away, or the place where it had been would as
mysteriously close. Huge icebergs crept silently towards
or past us, and continually we were observing these formidable
objects with range finder and compass to determine
the relative movement, sometimes with misgivings as to
our ability to clear them. Under steam the change of conditions
was even more marked. Sometimes we would enter
a lead of open water and proceed for a mile or two without
hindrance; sometimes we would come to big sheets of
thin ice which broke easily as our iron-shod prow struck
them, and sometimes even a thin sheet would resist all our
attempts to break it; sometimes we would push big floes
with comparative ease and sometimes a small floe would
bar our passage with such obstinacy that one would almost
believe it possessed of an evil spirit; sometimes we passed
through acres of sludgy sodden ice which hissed as it swept
along the side, and sometimes the hissing ceased seemingly
without rhyme or reason, and we found our screw churning
the sea without any effect.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus the steaming days passed away in an ever-changing
environment and are remembered as an unceasing
struggle.</p>

<p>&quot;The ship behaved splendidly&mdash;no other ship, not
even the Discovery, would have come through so well.
Certainly the Nimrod would never have reached the south
water had she been caught in such pack. As a result I have
grown strangely attached to the Terra Nova. As she
bumped the floes with mighty shocks, crushing and grinding
a way through some, twisting and turning to avoid
others, she seemed like a living thing fighting a great fight.
If only she had more economical engines she would be suitable
in all respects.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-11.jpg"><img src="./images/1-11_th.jpg" alt="Terra Nova" title="Terra Nova" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Terra Nova</span></p>
<hr />


<p>&quot;Once or twice we got among floes which stood 7 or
8 feet above water, with hummocks and pinnacles as high
as 25 feet. The ship could have stood no chance had such
floes pressed against her, and at first we were a little
alarmed in such situations. But familiarity breeds con<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>tempt;
there never was any pressure in the heavy ice, and
I'm inclined to think there never would be.</p>

<p>&quot;The weather changed frequently during our journey
through the pack. The wind blew strong from the west
and from the east; the sky was often darkly overcast; we
had snowstorms, flaky snow, and even light rain. In all
such circumstances we were better placed in the pack than
outside of it. The foulest weather could do us little harm.
During quite a large percentage of days, however, we had
bright sunshine, which, even with the temperature well
below freezing, made everything look bright and cheerful.
The sun also brought us wonderful cloud effects, marvellously
delicate tints of sky, cloud and ice, such effects as
one might travel far to see. In spite of our impatience we
would not willingly have missed many of the beautiful
scenes which our sojourn in the pack afforded us. Ponting
and Wilson have been busy catching these effects, but no
art can reproduce such colours as the deep blue of the icebergs.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>As a rule the officer of the watch conned from the
crow's nest, shouting his orders to the steersman direct,
and to the engine-room through the midshipman of the
watch, who stood upon the bridge. It is thrilling work to
the officer in charge, who not only has to face the immediate
problem of what floes he dare and what he dare not charge,
but also to puzzle out the best course for the future,&mdash;but I
expect he soon gets sick of it.</p>

<p>About this time Bowers made a fancy sketch of the
Terra Nova hitting an enormous piece of ice. The masts
are all whipped forward, and from the crow's nest is shot
first the officer of the watch, followed by cigarette ends and
empty cocoa mugs, and lastly the hay with which the floor
was covered. Upon the forecastle stands Farmer Hayseed
(Oates) chewing a straw with the greatest composure, and
waiting until the hay shall fall at his feet, at which time he
will feed it to his ponies. This crow's nest, which was a
barrel lashed to the top of the mainmast, to which entrance
was gained by a hinged trap-door, shielded the occupant
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>from most of the wind. I am not sure that the steersman
did not have the most uninviting job, but hot cocoa is a
most comforting drink and there was always plenty to
be had.</p>

<p>Rennick was busy sounding. The depths varied from
1804 to at least 3890 fathoms, and the bottom generally
showed volcanic deposits. Our line of soundings showed
the transition from the ocean depths to the continental
shelf. A series of temperatures was gained by Nelson by
means of reversible thermometers down to 3891 metres.</p>

<p>The winch upon which the sounding line was wound
was worked by hand on this cruise. It was worked mechanically
afterwards, and of course this ought always to be
done if possible. Just now it was a wearisome business,
especially when we lowered a water-sample bottle one day
to 1800 metres, spent hours in winding it up and found it
still open when it arrived at the surface! Water samples
were also obtained at the various depths. Lillie and Nelson
were both busy tow-netting for plankton with full-speed,
Apstein, Nansen, 24-and 180-mesh nets.</p>

<p>I don't think many at home had a more pleasant Christmas
Day than we. It was beautifully calm with the pack
all round. At 10 we had church with lots of Christmas
hymns, and then decorated the ward-room with all our
sledging flags. These flags are carried by officers on Arctic
expeditions, and are formed of the St. George's Cross with
a continuation ending in a swallow-tail in the heraldic
colours to which the individual is entitled, and upon this is
embroidered his crest. The men forrard had their Christmas
dinner of fresh mutton at mid-day; there was plenty of
penguin for them, but curiously enough they did not think
it good enough for a Christmas dinner. The ward-room
ate penguin in the evening, and after the toast of 'absent
friends' we began to sing, and twice round the table everybody
had to contribute a song. Ponting's banjo songs were
a great success, also Oates's 'The Vly on the tu-urmuts.'
Meares sang &quot;a little song about our Expedition, and
many of the members that Southward would go,&quot; of his
own composition. The general result was that the watches
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>were all over the place that night. At 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Day whispered
in my ear that there was nothing to do, and Pennell
promised to call me if there was&mdash;so I remembered no
more until past six.</p>

<p>And Crean's rabbit gave birth to seventeen little ones,
and it was said that Crean had already given away twenty-two.</p>

<p>We had stopped and banked fires against an immense
composite floe on the evening of Christmas Eve. How we
watched the little changes in the ice and the wind, and
scanned the horizon for those black patches which meant
open water ahead. But always there was that same white
sky to the south of us. And then one day there came the
shadow of movement on the sea, the faintest crush on the
brash ice, the whisper of great disturbances afar off. It
settled again: our hopes were dashed to the ground. Then
came the wind. It was so thick that we could not see far;
but even in our restricted field changes were in progress.</p>

<p>&quot;We commence to move between two floes, make 200
or 300 yards, and are then brought up bows on to a large
lump. This may mean a wait of anything from ten minutes
to half-an-hour, whilst the ship swings round, falls away,
and drifts to leeward. When clear she forges ahead again
and the operation is repeated. Occasionally when she can
get a little way on she cracks the obstacle and slowly passes
through it. There is a distinct swell&mdash;very long, very low.
I counted the period as about nine seconds. Every one
says the ice is breaking up.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>On December 28 the gale abated. The sky cleared, and
showed signs of open water ahead. It was cold in the wind
but the sun was wonderful, and we lay out on deck and
basked in its warmth, a cheerful, careless crowd. After
breakfast there was a consultation between Scott and Wilson
in the crow's nest. It was decided to raise steam.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we sounded, and found a volcanic muddy
bottom at 2035 fathoms. The last sounding showed 1400
fathoms; we had passed over a bank.</p>

<p>Steam came at 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and we began to push forward.<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>
At first it was hard going, but slowly we elbowed our way
until the spaces of open water became more frequent. Soon
we found one or two large pools, several miles in extent;
then the floes became smaller. Later we could see no really
big floes at all; &quot;the sheets of thin ice are broken into
comparatively regular figures, none more than thirty yards
across,&quot; and &quot;we are steaming amongst floes of small area
evidently broken by swell, and with edges abraded by
contact.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>We could not be far from the southern edge of the pack.
Twenty-four hours after raising steam we were still making
good progress, checking sometimes to carve our way
through some obstacle. At last we were getting a return
for the precious coal expended. The sky was overcast, the
outlook from the masthead flat and dreary, but hour by
hour it became more obvious that we neared the threshold
of the open sea. At 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on Friday, December 30 (lat.
about 71&frac12;&deg; S., noon observation 72&deg; 17&acute; S., 177&deg; 9&acute; E.)
Bowers steered through the last ice stream. Behind was
some 400 miles of ice. Cape Crozier was 334 miles (geog.)
ahead.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Beyond this flood a frozen continent<br /></span>
<span>Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms<br /></span>
<span>Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land<br /></span>

<p><br /></p>
<p>&quot;They say it's going to blow like hell. Go and look at the
glass.&quot; Thus Titus Oates quietly to me a few hours before
we left the pack.</p>

<p>I went and looked at the barograph and it made me feel
sea-sick. Within a few hours I was sick, <i>very</i> sick; but we
newcomers to the Antarctic had yet to learn that we knew
nothing about its barometer. Nothing very terrible happened
after all. When I got up to the bridge for the morning
watch we were in open water and it was blowing fresh.
It freshened all day, and by the evening it was blowing a
southerly with a short choppy North Sea swell, and very
warm. By 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the next morning there was a big sea
running and the dogs and ponies were having a bad time.
Rennick had the morning watch these days, and I was his
humble midshipman.</p>

<p>At 5.45 we sighted what we thought was a berg on the
port bow. About three minutes later Rennick said, &quot;There's
a bit of pack,&quot; and I went below and reported to Evans.
It was very thick with driving snow and also foggy, and
before Evans got up to the bridge we were quite near the
pack, and amongst bits which had floated from it, one of
which must have been our berg. We took in the headsails
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>as quickly as possible, these being the only sails set, and
nosed along dead slow to leeward under steam alone.
Gradually we could see either pack or the blink of it all
along our port and starboard beam, while gradually we felt
our way down a big patch of open water.</p>

<p>There was quite a meeting on the bridge, and it was
decided to get well in, and lie in open water under lee of
the pack till the gale blew itself out. &quot;Under ordinary
circumstances the safe course would have been to go about
and stand to the east. But in our case we must risk trouble
to get smoother water for the ponies. We passed a stream
of ice over which the sea was breaking heavily, and one
realized the danger of being amongst loose floes in such a
sea. But soon we came to a compacter body of floes, and
running behind this we were agreeably surprised to find
comparatively smooth water. We ran on for a bit, then
stopped and lay to.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>All that day we lay behind that pack, steaming slowly
to leeward every now and then, as the ice drifted down
upon us. Towards night it began to clear. It was New
Year's Eve.</p>

<p>I turned in, thinking to wake in 1911. But I had not
been long asleep when I found Atkinson at my side.
&quot;Have you seen the land?&quot; he said. &quot;Wrap your blankets
round you, and go and see.&quot; And when I got up on deck
I could see nothing for a while. Then he said: &quot;All the
high lights are snow lit up by the sun.&quot; And there they
were: the most glorious peaks appearing, as it were like
satin, above the clouds, the only white in a dark horizon.
The first glimpse of Antarctic land, Sabine and the great
mountains of the Admiralty Range. They were 110 miles
away. But</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Icy mountains high on mountains pil'd<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>and, truth to tell, I went back to my warm bunk. At midnight
a rowdy mob, ringing the New Year in with the
dinner-bell, burst into our Nursery. I expected to be
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>hauled out, but got off with a dig in the ribs from Birdie
Bowers.</p>

<p>In brilliant sunshine we coasted down Victoria Land.
&quot;To-night it is absolutely calm, with glorious bright sunshine.
Several people were sunning themselves at 11
o'clock! Sitting on deck and reading.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>At 8.30 on Monday night, January 2, we sighted
Erebus, 115 miles away. The next morning most of us
were on the yards furling sail. We were heading for Cape
Crozier, the northern face of Ross Island was open to our
fascinated gaze, and away to the east stretched the Barrier
face until it disappeared below the horizon. Ad&eacute;lie penguins
and Killer whales were abundant in the water through
which we steamed.</p>

<p>I have seen Fuji, the most dainty and graceful of all
mountains; and also Kinchinjunga: only Michael Angelo
among men could have conceived such grandeur. But give
me Erebus for my friend. Whoever made Erebus knew
all the charm of horizontal lines, and the lines of Erebus
are for the most part nearer the horizontal than the vertical.
And so he is the most restful mountain in the world, and I
was glad when I knew that our hut would lie at his feet.
And always there floated from his crater the lazy banner
of his cloud of steam.</p>

<p>Now we had reached the Barrier face some five miles
east of the point at which it joins the basalt cliffs of Cape
Crozier. We could see the great pressure waves which had
proved such an obstacle to travellers from the Discovery
to the Emperor penguin rookery. The Knoll was clear,
but the summit of Mount Terror was in the clouds. As for
the Barrier we seemed to have known it all our lives, it was
so exactly like what we had imagined it to be, and seen in
the pictures and photographs.</p>

<p>Scott had a whaler launched, and we pulled in under
the cliffs. There was a considerable swell.</p>

<p>&quot;We were to examine the possibilities of landing, but
the swell was so heavy in its break among the floating
blocks of ice along the actual beach and ice foot that a
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>landing was out of the question. We should have broken
up the boat and have all been in the water together. But I
assure you it was tantalizing to me, for there about six feet
above us on a small dirty piece of the old bay ice about ten
feet square one living Emperor penguin chick was standing
disconsolately stranded, and close by stood one faithful old
Emperor parent asleep. This young Emperor was still in
the down, a most interesting fact in the bird's life history
at which we had rightly guessed, but which no one had
actually observed before. It was in a stage never yet seen
or collected, for the wings were already quite clean of
down and feathered as in the adult, also a line down the
breast was shed of down and part of the head. This bird
would have been a treasure to me, but we could not risk
life for it, so it had to remain where it was. It was a curious
fact that with as much clean ice to live on as they could
have wished for, these destitute derelicts of a flourishing
colony, now gone north to sea on floating bay ice, should
have preferred to remain standing on the only piece of bay
ice left, a piece about ten feet square and now pressed up
six feet above water level, evidently wondering why it was
so long in starting north with the general exodus which
must have taken place just a month ago. The whole incident
was most interesting and full of suggestion as to the
slow working of the brain of these queer people. Another
point was most weird to see, that on the <i>under</i> side of this
very dirty piece of sea-ice, which was about two feet thick
and which hung over the water as a sort of cave, we could
see the legs and lower halves of dead Emperor chicks hanging
through, and even in one place a dead adult. I hope to
make a picture of the whole quaint incident, for it was a
corner crammed full of Imperial history in the light of
what we already knew, and it would otherwise have been
about as unintelligible as any group of animate or inanimate
nature could possibly have been. As it is, it throws more
light on the life history of this strangely primitive bird....</p>

<p>&quot;We were joking in the boat as we rowed under these
cliffs and saying it would be a short-lived amusement to see
the overhanging cliff part company and fall on us. So we
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>were glad to find that we were rowing back to the ship and
already 200 or 300 yards away from the place and in open
water when there was a noise like crackling thunder and a
huge plunge into the sea and a smother of rock dust like
the smoke of an explosion, and we realized that the very
thing had happened which we had just been talking about.
Altogether it was a very exciting row, for before we got on
board we had the pleasure of seeing the ship shoved in so
close to these cliffs by a belt of heavy pack ice that to us it
appeared a toss-up whether she got out again or got forced
in against the rocks. She had no time or room to turn, and
got clear by backing out through the belt of pack stern first,
getting heavy bumps under the counter and on the rudder
as she did so, for the ice was heavy and the swell considerable.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Westward of Cape Crozier the sides of Mount Terror
slope down to the sea, forming a possible landing-place in
calm weather. Here there is a large Ad&eacute;lie penguin rookery
in summer, and it was here that the Discovery left a record
of her movements tied to a post to guide the relieving ship
the following year. It was the return of a sledge party
which tried to reach this record from the Barrier that led to
Vince's terrible death.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> As we coasted along we could see this
post quite plainly, looking as new as the day it was erected,
and we know now that there is communication with the
Barrier behind, while this rookery itself is free from the
blizzards which sweep out to sea by Cape Crozier. It was
therefore an excellent place to winter and it was a considerable
disappointment to find that it was impossible
to land.</p>

<p>This was the first sight we had of a rookery of the little
Ad&eacute;lie penguin. Hundreds of thousands of birds dotted
the shore, and there were many thousands in the sea round
the ship. As we came to know these rookeries better we
came to look upon these quaint creatures more as familiar
friends than as casual acquaintances. Whatever a penguin
does has individuality, and he lays bare his whole life for
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>all to see. He cannot fly away. And because he is quaint
in all that he does, but still more because he is fighting
against bigger odds than any other bird, and fighting
always with the most gallant pluck, he comes to be considered
as something apart from the ordinary bird&mdash;sometimes
solemn, sometimes humorous, enterprising, chivalrous,
cheeky&mdash;and always (unless you are driving a dog-team)
a welcome and, in some ways, an almost human friend.</p>

<p>The alternative landing-place to Cape Crozier was somewhere
in McMurdo Sound, the essential thing being that
we should have access to and from the Barrier, such communication
having to be by sea-ice, since the land is for the
most part impassable. As we steamed from Cape Crozier
to Cape Bird, the N.W. extremity of Ross Island, we carried
out a detailed running survey.</p>

<p>When we neared Cape Bird and Beaufort Island we
could see that there was much pack in the mouth of the
Strait. By keeping close in to the land we avoided the worst
of the trouble, and &quot;as we rounded Cape Bird we came in
sight of the old well-remembered landmarks&mdash;Mount Discovery
and the Western Mountains&mdash;seen dimly through
a hazy atmosphere. It was good to see them again, and
perhaps after all we are better this side of the Island. It
gives one a homely feeling to see such a familiar scene.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Right round from Cape Crozier to Cape Royds the
coast is cold and forbidding, and for the most part heavily
crevassed. West of Cape Bird are some small penguin
rookeries, and high up on the ice slopes could be seen
some grey granite boulders. These are erratics, brought
by ice from the Western Mountains, and are evidence of
a warmer past when the Barrier rose some two thousand
feet higher than it does now, and stretched many hundreds
of miles farther out to sea. But now the Antarctic is becoming
colder, the deposition of snow is therefore farther
north, and the formation of ice correspondingly less.</p>

<p>Many watched all night, as this new world unfolded
itself, cape by cape and mountain by mountain. We pushed
through some heavy floes and &quot;at 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> (on January 4)<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>
we came through the last of the Strait pack some three
miles north of Cape Royds. We steered for the Cape, fully
expecting to find the edge of the pack-ice ranging westward
from it. To our astonishment we ran on past the
Cape with clear water or thin sludge ice on all sides of us.
Past Cape Royds, past Cape Barne, past the glacier on its
south side, and finally round and past Inaccessible Island,
a good two miles south of Cape Royds. The Cape itself
was cut off from the south. We could have gone farther,
but the last sludge ice seemed to be increasing in thickness,
and there was no wintering spot to aim for but Cape Armitage.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
I have never seen the ice of the Sound in such a
condition or the land so free from snow. Taking these
facts in conjunction with the exceptional warmth of the air,
I came to the conclusion that it had been an exceptionally
warm summer. At this point it was evident that we had a
considerable choice of wintering spots. We could have
gone to either of the small islands, to the mainland, the
Glacier Tongue, or pretty well anywhere except Hut Point.
My main wish was to choose a place that would not be
easily cut off from the Barrier, and my eye fell on a cape
which we used to call the Skuary, a little behind us. It was
separated from the old Discovery quarters by two deep
bays on either side of the Glacier Tongue, and I thought
that these bays would remain frozen until late in the season,
and that when they froze over again the ice would soon
become firm. I called a council and put these propositions.
To push on to the Glacier Tongue and winter there; to
push west to the 'tombstone' ice and to make our way to
an inviting spot to the northward of the cape we used to
call 'the Skuary.' I favoured the latter course, and on discussion
we found it obviously the best, so we turned back
close around Inaccessible Island and steered for the fast
ice off the Cape at full speed. After piercing a small fringe
of thin ice at the edge of the fast floe the ship's stem struck
heavily on hard bay ice about a mile and a half from the
shore. Here was a road to the Cape and a solid wharf
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>on which to land our stores. We made fast with ice-anchors.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Scott, Wilson and Evans walked away over the sea-ice,
but were soon back. They reported an excellent site for a
hut on a shelving beach on the northern side of the Cape
before us, which was henceforward called Cape Evans,
after our second in command. Landing was to begin forthwith.</p>

<p>First came the two big motor sledges which took up so
much of our deck space. In spite of the hundreds of tons
of sea-water which had washed over and about them they
came out of their big crates looking &quot;as fresh and clean as
if they had been packed on the previous day.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> They were
running that same afternoon.</p>

<p>We had a horse-box for the ponies, which came next,
but it wanted all Oates' skill and persuasion to get them
into it. All seventeen of them were soon on the floe, rolling
and kicking with joy, and thence they were led across to
the beach where they were carefully picketed to a rope run
over a snow slope where they could not eat sand. Shackleton
lost four out of eight ponies within a month of his
arrival. His ponies were picketed on rubbly ground at
Cape Royds, and ate the sand for the salt flavour it possessed.
The fourth pony died from eating shavings in
which chemicals had been packed. This does not mean
that they were hungry, merely that these Manchurian
ponies eat the first thing that comes in their way, whether
it be a bit of sugar or a bit of Erebus.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dog-teams were running light loads
between the ship and the shore. &quot;The great trouble with
them has been due to the fatuous conduct of the penguins.
Groups of these have been constantly leaping on to our
floe. From the moment of landing on their feet their whole
attitude expressed devouring curiosity and a pig-headed
disregard for their own safety. They waddle forward, poking
their heads to and fro in their usually absurd way, in
spite of a string of howling dogs straining to get at them.
'Hulloa!' they seem to say, 'here's a game&mdash;what do all
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>you ridiculous things want?' And they come a few steps
nearer. The dogs make a rush as far as their harness or
leashes allow. The penguins are not daunted in the least,
but their ruffs go up and they squawk with semblance of
anger, for all the world as though they were rebutting a
rude stranger&mdash;their attitude might be imagined to convey,
'Oh, that's the sort of animal you are; well, you've
come to the wrong place&mdash;we aren't going to be bluffed
and bounced by you,' and then the final fatal steps forward
are taken and they come within reach. There is a spring,
a squawk, a horrid red patch on the snow, and the incident
is closed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Everything had to be sledged nearly a mile and a half
across the sea-ice, but at midnight, after seventeen hours'
continuous work, the position was most satisfactory. The
large amount of timber which went to make the hut was
mostly landed. The ponies and dogs were sleeping in the
sun on shore. A large green tent housed the hut builders,
and the site for the hut was levelled.</p>

<p>&quot;Such weather in such a place comes nearer to satisfying
my ideal of perfection than any condition I have ever
experienced. The warm glow of the sun with the keen invigorating
cold of the air forms a combination which is
inexpressibly health-giving and satisfying to me, whilst
the golden light on this wonderful scene of mountain and
ice satisfies every claim of scenic magnificence. No words
of mine can convey the impressiveness of the wonderful
panorama displayed to our eyes.... It's splendid to see at
last the effect of all the months of preparation and organisation.
There is much snoring about me as I write (2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>)
from men tired after a hard day's work and preparing for
such another to-morrow. I also must sleep, for I have had
none for 48 hours&mdash;but it should be to dream happily.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Getting to bed about midnight and turning out at 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
we kept it up day after day. Petrol, paraffin, pony food,
dog food, sledges and sledging gear, hut furniture, provisions
of all kinds both for life at the hut and for sledging,
coal, scientific instruments and gear, carbide, medical stores,
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>clothing&mdash;I do not know how many times we sledged over
that sea-ice, but I do know that we were landed as regards
all essentials in six days. &quot;Nothing like it has been done
before; nothing so expeditious and complete.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> ... and
&quot;Words cannot express the splendid way in which every
one works.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The two motors, the two dog-teams, man-hauling
parties, and, as they were passed for work by Oates, the
ponies; all took part in this transport. As usual Bowers
knew just where everything was, and where it was to go,
and he was most ably seconded on the ship by Rennick and
Bruce. Both man-hauling parties and pony-leaders commonly
did ten journeys a day, a distance of over thirty
miles. The ponies themselves did one to three or four
journeys as they were considered fit.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the transport seemed satisfactory,
but it soon became clear that sea-ice was very hard on the
motor sledge runners. &quot;The motor sledges are working
well, but not very well; the small difficulties will be got
over, but I rather fear they will never draw the loads we
expect of them. Still they promise to be a help, and they
are a lively and attractive feature of our present scene as
they drone along over the floe. At a little distance, without
silencers, they sound exactly like threshing machines.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The ponies were the real problem. It was to be expected
that they would be helpless and exhausted after their
long and trying voyage. Not a bit of it! They were soon
rolling about, biting one another, kicking one another, and
any one else, with the best will in the world. After two
days' rest on shore, twelve of them were thought fit to do
one journey, on which they pulled loads varying from 700
to 1000 lbs. with ease on the hard sea-ice surface. But it
was soon clear that these ponies were an uneven lot. There
were the steady workers like Punch and Nobby; there
were one or two definitely weak ponies like Blossom,
Bl&uuml;cher and Jehu; and there were one or two strong but
rather impossible beasts. One of these was soon known as
Weary Willie. His outward appearance belied him, for he
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>looked like a pony. A brief acquaintance soon convinced
me that he was without doubt a cross between a pig and
a mule. He was obviously a strong beast and, since he
always went as slowly as possible and stopped as often as
possible it was most difficult to form any opinion as to what
load he was really able to draw. Consequently I am afraid
there is little doubt that he was generally overloaded until
that grim day on the Barrier when he was set upon by a
dog-team. It was his final collapse at the end of the Dep&ocirc;t
journey which caused Scott to stay behind when we went
out on the sea-ice. But of that I shall speak again.</p>

<p>Twice only have I ever seen Weary Willie trot. We
were leading the ponies now as always with halters and
without bits. Consequently our control was limited, especially
on ice, but doubtless the ponies' comfort was increased,
especially in cold weather when a metal bit would
have been difficult if not impossible. On this occasion he
and I had just arrived at the ship after a trudge in which I
seemed to be pulling both Weary and the sledge. Just
then a motor back-fired, and we started back across that
floe at a pace which surprised Weary even more than myself,
for he fell over the sledge, himself and me, and for
days I felt like a big black bruise. The second occasion on
which he got a move on was during the Dep&ocirc;t journey
when Gran on ski tried to lead him.</p>

<p>Christopher and Hackenschmidt were impossible ponies.
Christopher, as we shall see, died on the Barrier a year
after this, fighting almost to the last. Hackenschmidt, so
called &quot;from his vicious habit of using both fore and hind
legs in attacking those who came near him,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> led an even
more lurid life but had a more peaceful end. Whether
Oates could have tamed him I do not know: he would have
done it if it were possible, for his management of horses
was wonderful. But in any case Hackenschmidt sickened at
the hut while we were absent on the Dep&ocirc;t journey, for
no cause which could be ascertained, gradually became too
weak to stand, and was finally put out of his misery.</p>

<p>There was a breathless minute when Hackenschmidt,
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>with a sledge attached to him, went galloping over the hills
and boulders. Below him, all unconscious of his impending
fate, was Ponting, adjusting a large camera with his usual
accuracy. Both survived. There were runaways innumerable,
and all kinds of falls. But these ponies could tumble
about unharmed in a way which would cause an English
horse to lie up for a week. &quot;There is no doubt that the
bumping of the sledges close at the heels of the animals is
the root of the evil.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>There were two adventures during this first week of
landing stores which might well have had a more disastrous
conclusion. The first of these was the adventure of Ponting
and the Killer whales.</p>

<p>&quot;I was a little late on the scene this morning, and
thereby witnessed a most extraordinary scene. Some six or
seven killer whales, old and young, were skirting the fast
floe edge ahead of the ship; they seemed excited and dived
rapidly, almost touching the floe. As we watched, they
suddenly appeared astern, raising their snouts out of water.
I had heard weird stories of these beasts, but had never
associated serious danger with them. Close to the water's
edge lay the wire stern rope of the ship, and our two
Esquimaux dogs were tethered to this. I did not think of
connecting the movement of the whales with this fact, and
seeing them so close I shouted to Ponting, who was standing
abreast of the ship. He seized his camera and ran
towards the floe edge to get a close picture of the beasts,
which had momentarily disappeared. The next moment
the whole floe under him and the dogs heaved up and split
into fragments. One could hear the booming noise as the
whales rose under the ice and struck it with their backs.
Whale after whale rose under the ice, setting it rocking
fiercely; luckily Ponting kept his feet and was able to fly
to security. By an extraordinary chance also, the splits had
been made around and between the dogs, so that neither of
them fell into the water. Then it was clear that the whales
shared our astonishment, for one after another their huge
hideous heads shot vertically into the air through the
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>cracks which they had made. As they reared them to a
height of six or eight feet it was possible to see their tawny
head markings, their small glistening eyes, and their
terrible array of teeth&mdash;by far the largest and most terrifying
in the world. There cannot be a doubt that they
looked up to see what had happened to Ponting and the
dogs.</p>

<p>&quot;The latter were horribly frightened and strained to
their chains, whining; the head of one killer must certainly
have been within five feet of one of the dogs.</p>

<p>&quot;After this, whether they thought the game insignificant,
or whether they missed Ponting is uncertain, but the
terrifying creatures passed on to other hunting grounds,
and we were able to rescue the dogs, and what was even
more important, our petrol&mdash;five or six tons of which was
waiting on a piece of ice which was not split away from the
main mass.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, we have known well that killer whales
continually skirt the edge of the floes and that they would
undoubtedly snap up any one who was unfortunate enough
to fall into the water; but the facts that they could display
such deliberate cunning, that they were able to break ice
of such thickness (at least 2&frac12; feet), and that they could act
in unison, were a revelation to us. It is clear that they are
endowed with singular intelligence, and in future we shall
treat that intelligence with every respect.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>We were to be hunted by these Killer whales again.</p>

<p>The second adventure was the loss of the third motor
sledge. It was Sunday morning, January 8, and Scott had
given orders that this motor was to be hoisted out of the
ship. &quot;This was done first thing and the motor placed
on firm ice. Later Campbell told me one of the men had
dropped a leg through crossing a sludgy patch some 200
yards from the ship. I didn't consider it very serious, as
I imagined the man had only gone through the surface
crust. About 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I started for the shore with a single
man load, leaving Campbell looking about for the best
crossing for the motor.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></p>

<p>I find a note in my own diary as to what happened
after that: &quot;Last night the ice was getting very soft in
places, and I was a little doubtful about leading ponies
over a spot on the route to the hut which is about a quarter
of a mile from the ship. It has been thawing very fast the
last few days, and has been very hot as Antarctic weather
goes. This morning was the same, and Bailey went in up
to his neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Some half-hour after the motor was put on to the
floe, we were told to tow it on to firm ice as that near the
ship was breaking up. All hands started on a long tow
line. We got on to the rotten piece, and somebody behind
shouted 'You must run.' From that moment everything
happened very quickly. Williamson fell right in through
the ice; immediately afterwards we were all brought up
with a jerk. Then the line began to pull us backwards;
the stern of the motor had sunk through the ice, and the
whole car began to sink. It slowly went right through and
disappeared and then the tow line followed it. Everything
possible was done to hang on to the rope, but in the end we
had to let it go, each man keeping his hold until he was
dragged to the lip of the hole. Then we made for the fast
ice, leaving the rotten bit between us and the ship.</p>

<p>&quot;Pennell and Priestley sounded their way back to the
ship, and Day asked Priestley to bring his goggles when he
returned. They came back with a life-line, Pennell leading.
Suddenly the ice gave way under Priestley, who disappeared
entirely and came up, so we learned afterwards,
under the ice, there being a big current. In a moment
Pennell was lying flat upon the floe on his chest, got his
hand under Priestley's arm, and so pulled him out. All
Priestley said was, 'Day, here are your goggles.' We all
got back to the ship, but communication between the ship
and the shore was interrupted for the rest of the day, when
a solid road was found right up to the ship in another
place.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the hut was rising very quickly, and Davies,
who was Chippy Chap, the carpenter, deserves much credit.<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
He was a leading shipwright in the navy, always willing
and bright, and with a very thorough knowledge of his job.
I have seen him called up hour after hour, day and night,
on the ship, when the pumps were choked by the coal
balls which formed in the bilges, and he always arrived
with a smile on his face. Altogether he was one of our
most useful men. In this job of hut-building he was helped
by two of our seamen, Keohane and Abbott, and others.
Latterly I believe there were more people working than
there were hammers!</p>

<p>A plan of this hut is given here. It was 50 feet long, by
25 feet wide, and 9 feet to the eaves. The insulation, which
was very satisfactory, was seaweed, sewn up in the form of
a quilt.</p>

<p>&quot;The sides have double [match-] boarding inside and
outside the frames, with a layer of our excellent quilted
seaweed insulation between each pair of boardings. The
roof has a single match-boarding inside, but on the outside
is a match-boarding, then a layer of 2-ply ruberoid, then
a layer of quilted seaweed, then a second match-boarding,
and finally a cover of 3-ply ruberoid.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The floor consisted of a wooden boarding next the
frame, then a quilt of seaweed, then a layer of felt upon
which was a second boarding and finally linoleum.</p>

<p>We thought we should be warm, and we were. In fact,
during the winter, with twenty-five men living there, and
the cooking range going, and perhaps also the stove at the
other end, the hut not infrequently became fuggy, big
though it was.</p>

<p>The entrance was through a door in a porch before you
got to the main door. In the porch were the generators of
the acetylene gas, which was fitted throughout by Day,
who was also responsible for the fittings of the ventilator,
cooking range, and stove, the chimney pipes from these
running along through the middle of the hut before entering
a common vent. Little heat was lost. The pipes were
fitted with dampers, and air inlets which could be opened
or shut at will to control the ventilation. Besides a big
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>ventilator in the top of the hut there was an adjustable
air inlet also at the base of the chamber which formed the
junction of the two chimneys. The purpose of this was
also ventilation, but it was not successful.</p>

<p>The bulkhead which separated the men's quarters, or
mess deck, from the rest of the hut, was formed of such
cases as contained goods in glass, including wine, which
would have frozen and broken outside. The bulkhead
did not go as high as the top of the hut. When the contents
of a case were wanted, a side of the box was taken out,
and the empty case then formed a shelf.</p>

<p>We started to live in the hut on January 18, beautifully
warm, the gramophone going, and everybody happy.
But for a long time before this most of the landing party
had been living in tents on shore. It was very comfortable,
far more so than might be supposed, judging only by the
popular idea of a polar life. We were now almost landed,
there were just a few things more to come over from the
ship. &quot;It was blowing a mild blizzard from the south,
and I took a sledge over to the ship, which was quite
blotted out in blinding snow at times. It was as hard to
get an empty sledge over, as generally it is to drag a full
one. Tea on the ship, which was very full of welcome,
but also very full of the superiority of their own comforts
over those of the land. Their own comforts were not so
very obvious, since they had tried to get the stove in the
wardroom going for the first time. They were all coughing
in the smoke, and everything inside was covered with
smuts.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The hut itself was some twelve feet above the sea, and
situated upon what was now an almost sandy beach of
black lava. It was thought that this was high enough to be
protected from any swell likely to arrive in such a sheltered
place, but, as we shall see, Scott was very anxious as to the
fate of the hut, when, on the Dep&ocirc;t journey, a swell removed
not only miles of sea-ice and a good deal of Barrier,
but also the end of Glacier Tongue. We never saw this
beach again, for the autumn gales covered it with thick
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>drifts of snow, and the thaw was never enough to remove
this for the two other summers we spent here. There is no
doubt this was an exceptional year for thaw. We never
again saw a little waterfall such as was now tumbling down
the rocks from Skua Lake into the sea.</p>

<p>The little hill of 66 feet high behind us was soon named
Wind Vane Hill, and there were other meteorological instruments
there besides. A snow-drift or ice-drift always
forms to leeward of any such projection, and that beneath
this hill was large enough for us to drive into it two ice
caves. The first of these was to contain our larder, notably
the frozen mutton carcasses brought down by us from New
Zealand in the ice-house on deck. These, however, showed
signs of mildew, and we never ate very freely of them.
Seal and penguin were our stock meat foods, and mutton
was considered to be a luxury.</p>

<p>The second cave, 13 feet long by 5 feet wide, hollowed
out by Simpson and Wright, was for the magnetic instruments.
The temperature of these caves was found to
be fairly constant. Unfortunately, this was the only drift
into which we could tunnel, and we had no such mass of
snow and ice as is afforded by the Barrier, which can be
burrowed, and was burrowed extensively by Amundsen
and his men.</p>

<p>The cases containing the bulk of our stores were placed
in stacks arranged by Bowers up on the sloping ground to
the west of the hut, beginning close to the entrance door.
The sledges lay on the hill side above them. This arrangement
was very satisfactory during the first winter, but the
excessive blizzards of the second winter and the immense
amount of snow which was gathering about the camp
caused us to move everything up to the top of the ridge
behind the hut where the wind kept them more clear.
Amundsen found it advisable to put his cases in two long
lines.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The dogs were tethered to a long chain or rope. The
ponies' stable was built against the northern side of the
hut, and was thus sheltered from the blizzards which
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>always blow here from the south. Against the south side of
the hut Bowers built himself a store-room. &quot;Every day he
conceives or carries out some plan to benefit the camp.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>&quot;Scott seems very cheery about things,&quot; I find in my
diary about this time. And well he might be. A man could
hardly be better served. We slaved until we were nearly
dead-beat, and then we found something else to do until
we were quite dead-beat. Ship's company and landing
parties alike, not only now but all through this job, did
their very utmost, and their utmost was very good. The
way men worked was fierce.</p>

<p>&quot;If you can picture our house nestling below this small
hill on a long stretch of black sand, with many tons of provision
cases ranged in neat blocks in front of it and the sea
lapping the ice-foot below, you will have some idea of our
immediate vicinity. As for our wider surroundings it would
be difficult to describe their beauty in sufficiently glowing
terms. Cape Evans is one of the many spurs of Erebus
and the one that stands closest under the mountain, so that
always towering above us we have the grand snowy peak
with its smoking summit. North and south of us are deep
bays, beyond which great glaciers come rippling over the
lower slopes to thrust high blue-walled snouts into the sea.
The sea is blue before us, dotted with shining bergs or ice
floes, whilst far over the Sound, yet so bold and magnificent
as to appear near, stand the beautiful Western Mountains
with their numerous lofty peaks, their deep glacial
valley and clear cut scarps, a vision of mountain scenery
that can have few rivals.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<hr />


<p>&quot;Before I left England people were always telling me
the Antarctic must be dull without much life. Now we are
in ourselves a perfect farmyard. There are nineteen ponies
fifty yards off and thirty dogs just behind, and they howl
like the wolves they are at intervals, led by Dyk. The
skuas are nesting all round and fighting over the remains
of the seals which we have killed, and the penguins which
the dogs have killed, whenever they have got the chance.<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>
The collie bitch which we have brought down for breeding
purposes wanders about the camp. A penguin is standing
outside my tent, presumably because he thinks he is going
to moult here. A seal has just walked up into the horse
lines&mdash;there are plenty of Weddell and penguins and
whales. On board we have Nigger and a blue Persian
kitten, with rabbits and squirrels. The whole place teems
with life.</p>

<p>&quot;Franky Drake is employed all day wandering round
for ice for watering the ship. Yesterday he had made a pile
out on the floe, and the men wanted to have a flag put on
it, and have it photographed, and called 'Mr. Drake's
Furthest South.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>January 25 was fixed as the day upon which twelve
of us, with eight ponies and the two dog-teams, were to
start south to lay a dep&ocirc;t upon the Barrier for the Polar
Journey. Scott was of opinion that the bays between us and
the Hut Point Peninsula would freeze over in March,
probably early in March, and that we should most of us
get back to Cape Evans then. At the same time the
ponies could not come down over the cliffs of this tongue
of land, and preparations had to be made for a lengthy
stay at Hut Point for them and their keepers. For this
purpose Scott meant to use the old Discovery hut at Hut
Point.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>On January 15 he took Meares and one dog-team, and
started for Hut Point, which was fifteen statute miles to
the south of us. They crossed Glacier Tongue, finding
upon it a dep&ocirc;t of compressed fodder and maize which
had been left by Shackleton. The open water to the west
nearly reached the Tongue.</p>

<p>On arrival at the hut Scott was shocked to find it full
of snow and ice. This was serious, and, as we found afterwards
the drifted snow had thawed down into ice: the
whole of the inside of this hut was a big ice block. In the
middle of this ice was a pile of cases left by the Discovery
as a dep&ocirc;t. They were, we knew, full of biscuit.</p>

<p>&quot;There was something too depressing in finding the
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>old hut in such a desolate condition. I had had so much
interest in seeing all the old landmarks and the huts apparently
intact. To camp outside and feel that all the
old comforts and cheer had departed was dreadfully heartrending.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>That night &quot;we slept badly till the morning and, therefore,
late. After breakfast we went up the hills; there was
a keen S.E. breeze, but the sun shone and my spirits revived.
There was very much less snow everywhere than I
had ever seen. The ski run was completely cut through in
two places, the Gap and Observation Hill almost bare, a
great bare slope on the side of Arrival Heights, and on top
of Crater Heights an immense bare table-land. How delighted
we should have been to see it like this in the old
days! The pond was thawed and the confervae green in
fresh water. The hole which we had dug in the mound in
the pond was still there, as Meares discovered by falling
into it up to his waist, and getting very wet.</p>

<p>&quot;On the south side we could see the pressure ridges
beyond Pram Point as of old&mdash;Horseshoe Bay calm and
unpressed&mdash;the sea-ice pressed on Pram Point and along
the Gap ice front, and a new ridge running around C.
Armitage about 2 miles off. We saw Ferrar's old thermometer
tubes standing out of the snow slope as though
they'd been placed yesterday. Vince's cross might have
been placed yesterday&mdash;the paint was so fresh and the inscription
so legible.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>We had two officers who had been with Shackleton in
his 1908 Expedition&mdash;Priestley, who was in our Northern
Party, and Day, who was in charge of our motors. Priestley
with two others sledged over to Cape Royds and has left an
account of the old hut there:</p>

<p>&quot;After pitching tent Levick and I went over to the hut
to forage. On the way I visited Derrick Point and took a
large seven-pound tin of butter while Levick opened up
the hut. It was very dark inside but I pulled the boarding
down from the windows so that we could see all right. It
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>was very funny to see everything lying about just as we
had left it, in that last rush to get off in the lull of the blizzard.
On Marston's bunk was a sixpenny copy of the
Story of Bessie Costrell, which some one had evidently
read and left open. Perhaps what brought the old times
back again more than anything else was the fact that as I
came out of the larder the sleeve of my wind clothes caught
the tap of the copper and turned it on. When I heard the
drip of the water I turned instinctively and turned the tap
off, almost expecting to hear Bobs' raucous voice cursing
me for my clumsiness. Perhaps what strikes one more
forcibly than anything else is the fact that nothing has
been disturbed. On the table was the remains of a batch
of bread that Bobs had cooked for us and that was only
partially consumed before the Nimrod called for us. Some
of the rolls showed the impression of bites given to them
in 1909. All round the bread were the sauces, pickles,
pepper and salt of our usual standing lunch, and a half-opened
tin of gingerbreads was a witness to the dryness
of the climate for they were still crisp as the day they
were opened.</p>

<p>&quot;In the cubicle near the larder were the loose tins that
poor Armytage and myself had collected from all round
the hut before we left.</p>

<p>&quot;On the shelves of my cubicle are still stacked the
magazines and paper brought down by the relief ship.
Nothing is changed at all except the company. It is almost
dismal. I expect to see people come in through the door
after a walk over the surrounding hills.</p>

<p>&quot;We had not much time to look round us; for Campbell
was cooking in the tent, so we slung a few tins of jam,
a plum-pudding, some tea, and gingerbreads into a sack,
and returned to camp. By this time it was snowing heavily
and continued to do so after dinner so that we turned in
immediately (1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>) and went off to sleep. One thing
worth mentioning is that on several of the drifts are
well-defined hoof marks, some of them looking so new
that we could have sworn that they had been made this
year.<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></p>

<p>&quot;The Old Sport [Levick] gave us a start by suddenly
announcing that he could see a ship quite close, and for
some time we were on tenterhooks, but his ship proved
to be the Terra Nova ice-anchored off the Skuary.</p>

<p>&quot;The whole place is very eerie, there is such a feeling
of life about it. Not only do I feel it but the others do also.
Last night after I turned in I could have sworn that I
heard people shouting to each other.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought that I had only got an attack of nerves but
Campbell asked me if I had heard any shouting, for he had
certainly done so. It must have been the seals calling to
each other, but it certainly did sound most human. We are
getting so worked up that we should not be a bit surprised
to see a settlement of Japanese or some other such people
some day when we stroll round towards Blacksand Beach.
The Old Sport created some amusement this evening by
opening a tin of Nestl&eacute;'s milk at both ends instead of
making the two holes at one end. He informed us that he
had got so used to using two whole tins of milk for cocoa
for fourteen people at night that he always opened them
that way.</p>

<p>&quot;As a consequence we have to spend most of our spare
time making bungs to keep the milk in the tin.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, as was to be expected, the action of the,
I suspect, abnormal summer sea temperature was showing
its effect upon the sea-ice. Sea-ice thaws from below when
the temperature of the water rises. The northern ice goes
out first here, being next to the open water, but big thaw
pools form at the same time wherever a current of water
flows over shallows, as at the end of Cape Evans, Hut
Point and Cape Armitage.</p>

<p>On January 17 the ice was breaking away between the
point of Cape Evans and the ship, although a road still
remained fast between the ship and the shore. The ship
began to get up steam, but the fast ice broke away quickly
that night. I believe they got steam in three hours, twelve
hours being the time generally allowed: only just in time,
however, for she broke adrift as it was reported. The next
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>morning she made fast to the ice only 200 yards from the
ice-foot of the Cape.</p>

<p>&quot;For the present the position is extraordinarily comfortable.
With a southerly blow she would simply bind on
to the ice, receiving great shelter from the end of the Cape.
With a northerly blow she might turn rather close to the
shore, where the soundings run to three fathoms, but
behind such a stretch of ice she could scarcely get a sea or
swell without warning. It looks a wonderfully comfortable
little nook, but of course one can be certain of nothing in
this place; one knows from experience how deceptive the
appearance of security may be.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The ship's difficulties were largely due to the shortage
of coal. Again on the night of January 20-21 we had an
anxious time.</p>

<p>&quot;Fearing a little trouble I went out of the hut in the
middle of the night and saw at once that she was having
a bad time&mdash;the ice was breaking with a northerly swell
and the wind increasing, with the ship on dead lee shore;
luckily the ice anchors had been put well in on the floe
and some still held. Pennell was getting up steam and his
men struggling to replace the anchors.</p>

<p>&quot;We got out the men and gave some help. At 6
steam was up, and I was right glad to see the ship back out
to windward, leaving us to recover anchors and hawsers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>A big berg drove in just after the ship had got away,
and grounded where she had been lying. The ship returned
in the afternoon, and it seems that she was searching
round for an anchorage, and trying to look behind this
berg. There was a strongish northerly wind blowing.
The currents and soundings round Cape Evans were then
unknown. The current was setting strongly from the
north through the strip of sea which divides Inaccessible
Island from Cape Evans, a distance of some two-thirds
of a mile. The engines were going astern, but the current
and wind were too much for her, and the ship ran aground,
being fast for some considerable distance aft&mdash;some said
as far as the mainmast.<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></p>

<p>&quot;Visions of the ship failing to return to New Zealand
and of sixty people waiting here arose in my mind with
sickening pertinacity, and the only consolation I could draw
from such imaginations was the determination that the
southern work should go on as before&mdash;meanwhile the
least ill possible seemed to be an extensive lightening of
the ship with boats as the tide was evidently high when she
struck&mdash;a terribly depressing prospect.</p>

<p>&quot;Some three or four of us watched it gloomily from the
shore whilst all was bustle on board, the men shifting cargo
aft. Pennell tells me they shifted 10 tons in a very short
time.</p>

<p>&quot;The first ray of hope came when by careful watching
one could see that the ship was turning very slowly, then
one saw the men running from side to side and knew that
an attempt was being made to roll her off. The rolling
produced a more rapid turning movement at first, and then
she seemed to hang again. But only for a short time; the
engines had been going astern all the time and presently a
slight movement became apparent. But we only knew she
was getting clear when we heard cheers on board, and
more cheers from the whaler.</p>

<p>&quot;Then she gathered stern way and was clear. The
relief was enormous.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>All this took some time, and Scott himself came back
into the hut with us and went on bagging provisions for
the Dep&ocirc;t journey. At such times of real disaster he was
a very philosophical man. We were not yet ready to go
sledging, but on January 23 the ice in North Bay all went
out, and that in South Bay began to follow it. Because
this was our road to the Barrier, it was suddenly decided
that we must start on the Dep&ocirc;t journey the following day
or perhaps not at all. Already it was impossible to get
sledges south off the Cape: but there was a way to walk
the ponies along the land until they could be scrambled
down a steep rubbly slope on to sea-ice which still remained.
Would it float away before we got there? It
was touch and go. &quot;One breathes a prayer that the Road
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>holds for the few remaining hours. It goes in one place
between a berg in open water and a large pool of the
Glacier face&mdash;it may be weak in that part, and at any
moment the narrow isthmus may break away. We are
doing it on a very narrow margin.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Imaginative friends of the thirteen men who started from
Cape Evans on January 24, 1911, may have thought of
them as athletes, trained for some weeks or months to
endure the strains which they were to face, sleeping a good
nine hours a night, eating carefully regulated meals and
doing an allotted task each day under scientific control.</p>

<p>They would be far from the mark. For weeks we had
turned in at midnight too tired to take off our clothes, and
had been lucky if we were allowed to sleep until 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
We had eaten our meals when we could, and we had
worked in the meantime just as hard as it was physically
possible to do. If we sat down on a packing-case we went
to sleep.</p>

<p>And we finally left the camp in a state of hurry bordering
upon panic. Since the ice to the south of us, the road
to the Barrier, was being nibbled away by thaw, winds and
tides, it was impossible to lead the ponies down from the
Cape on to the sea-ice. The open sea was before us and on
our right front. It was necessary to lead them up among
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>the lava blocks which lay on the escarpment of Erebus,
south-eastwards towards Land's End, and thence to slide
them down a steep but rubbly slope to the ice which still
remained. As a matter of fact that ice went out the very next
day.</p>

<p>During the last two days provisions had been bagged
with the utmost despatch; sledges packed; letters
scribbled; clothing sorted and rough alterations to it
made. Scott was busy, with Bowers' help, making such
arrangements as could be suggested for a further year's
stay, for which the ship was to order the necessaries. Oates
was busy weighing out the pony food for the journey,
sorting harness, and generally managing a most unruly
mob of ponies. Many were the arguments as to the
relative value of a pair of socks or their equivalent weight
in tobacco, for we were allowed 12 lbs. of private gear
apiece, to consist of everything which we did not habitually
wear on our bodies. This included such things as:</p>


<ul><li>Sleeping-boots.</li>
<li>Sleeping-socks.</li>
<li>Extra pair of day socks.</li>
<li>A shirt.</li>
<li>Tobacco and pipe.</li>
<li>Notebook for diary and pencil.</li>
<li>Extra balaclava helmet.</li>
<li>Extra woollen mitts.</li>
<li>Housewife containing buttons, needles, darning needles, thread and wool.</li>
<li>Extra pair of finnesko.</li>
<li>Big safety-pins with which to hang up our socks.</li>
<li>And perhaps one small book.</li>
</ul>

<p>My most vivid recollection of the day we started is the
sight of Bowers, out of breath, very hot, and in great pain
from a bad knock which he had given his knee against a
rock, being led forward by his big pony Uncle Bill, over
whom temporarily he had but little control. He had been
left behind in the camp, giving last instructions about the
storage of cases and management of provisions, and had
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>practically lost himself in trying to follow us over what was
then unknown ground. He was wearing all the clothing
which was not included in his personal gear, for he did not
think it fair to give the pony the extra weight. He had
bruised his leg in an ugly way, and for many days he came
to me to bandage it. He was afraid that if he let the doctors
see it they would forbid him to go forward. He had had no
sleep for seventy-two hours.</p>

<p>That first night (January 24) we pitched our inexperienced
camp not far from Hut Point. But our first taste
of sledging was not without incident. Starting with the
ponies only we walked them to Glacier Tongue, where the
ice and open water joined, and as we went we watched the
ship pass us out in the Strait and moor up to the end of the
Tongue. Getting the ponies across the Tongue with its
shallow but numerous crevasses and holes was ticklish
work, but we tethered them safely off the Terra Nova,
which meanwhile was landing dogs, sledges and gear.
Then we got some lunch on board. A large lead in the sea-ice
to the south of the Tongue necessitated some hours'
work in man-hauling all sledges along the back of the
Tongue until a way could be found down on to safe ice.
We then followed with the ponies. &quot;If a pony falls into
one of these holes I shall sit down and cry,&quot; said Oates.
Within three minutes my pony was wallowing, with only
his head and forelegs visible, in a mess of brash and snow,
which had concealed a crack in the sea-ice which was
obviously not going to remain much longer in its present
position. We got lashings round him and hauled him out.
Poor Guts! He was fated to drown: but in an hour he
appeared to have forgotten all about his mishap, and was
pulling his first load towards Hut Point as gallantly as
always.</p>

<p>The next day we took further stores from the ship to
the camp which had formed. Some of these loads were to
be left on the edge of the Barrier when we got there, but
for the present we had to relay, that is, take one load forward
and come back for another.</p>

<p>On the 26th we sledged back to the ship for our last
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>load, and said good-bye on the sea-ice to those men with
whom we had already worked so long, to Campbell and his
five companions who were to suffer so much, to cheery
Pennell and his ship's company.</p>

<p>Before we left, Scott thanked Pennell and his men &quot;for
their splendid work. They have behaved like bricks, and a
finer lot of men never sailed in a ship.... It was a little
sad to say farewell to all these good fellows and Campbell
and his men. I do most heartily trust that all will be successful
in their ventures, for indeed their unselfishness
and their generous high spirit deserve reward. God bless
them.&quot;</p>

<p>Four of that Dep&ocirc;t party were never to see these men
again, and Pennell, Commander of the Queen Mary, went
down with his ship in the battle of Jutland.</p>

<p>Two days later, January 28, we sledged our first loads
on to the Barrier. By that day we had done nearly ninety
miles of relay work, first from the ship at Glacier Tongue
to our camp off Hut Point, and then onwards. Those first
days of sledging were wonderful! What memories they
must have brought to Scott and Wilson when to us, who
had never seen them before, these much-discussed landmarks
were almost like old friends. As we made our way
over the frozen sea every seal-hole was of interest, and every
type of wind-swept snow a novelty. The peak of Terror
opened out behind the crater of Erebus, and we walked
under Castle Rock and Danger Slope until, rounding the
promontory, we saw the little jagged Hut Point, and on it
the cross placed there to Vince's memory, all unchanged.
There was the old Discovery hut and the Bay in which
the Discovery lay, and from which she was almost miraculously
freed at the last moment, only to be flung upon the
shoal which runs out from the Point, where some tins of the
old Discovery days lie on the bottom still and glint in the
evening sun. And round about the Bay were the Heights
of which we had read, Observation Hill, and Crater Hill
separated from it by The Gap&mdash;through which the wind
was streaming; of course it was, for this must be the
famous Hut Point wind.<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></p>

<p>A few hundred more blizzards had swept over it since
those days, but it was all just the same, even to Ferrar's
little stakes placed across the glacierets to mark their movement,
more, even to the footsteps still plainly visible on the
slopes.</p>

<p>The ponies were dragging up to 900 lbs. each these
days, and though they did not seem to be unduly distressed,
two of them soon showed signs of lameness. This caused
some anxiety, but the trouble was mended by rest. On the
whole, though the surface was hard, I think we were giving
them too much weight.</p>

<p>The sea-ice off Hut Point and Observation Hill was
already very dangerous, and had we then had the experience
and knowledge of sea-ice with which we can now look back,
it is probable that we should not have slept so easily upon
its surface. Parties travelling to Hut Point and beyond in
summer must keep well out from the Point and Cape
Armitage. But all haste was being made to transport the
necessary stores on to the Barrier surface, where a big home
dep&ocirc;t could be made, so far as we could judge, in safety.
The pressure ridges in the sea-ice between Cape Armitage
and Pram Point, which are formed by the movement of the
Barrier, were large, and in some of the hollows countless
seals were playing in the water. Judging by the size of
these ridges and by the thickness of this ice when it broke
up, the ice south of Hut Point was at least two years
old.</p>

<p>I well remember the day we took the first of our loads
on to the Barrier. I expect we were all a little excited, for
to walk upon the Barrier for the first time was indeed an
adventure: what kind of surface was it, and how about
these beastly crevasses of which we had read so much?
Scott was ahead, and so far as we could see there was
nothing but the same level of ice all round&mdash;when suddenly
he was above us, walking up the sloping and quite
invisible drift. A minute after and our ponies and sledges
were up and over the tide crack, and beneath us soft and
yielding snow, very different from the hard wind-swept surface
of the frozen sea, which we had just left. Really it was
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>rather prosaic and a tame entrance. But the Barrier is a
tricky place, and it takes years to get to know her.</p>

<p>On our outward journey this day Oates did his best to
kill a seal. My own tent was promised some kidneys if we
were good, and our mouths watered with the prospect of
the hoosh before us. The seal had been left for dead, and
when on our homeward way we neared the place of his
demise Titus went off to carve our dinner from him. The
next thing we saw was the seal lolloping straight for his
hole, while Oates did his best to stab him. The quarry
made off safely not much hurt, for, as we discovered later,
a clasp-knife is quite useless to kill a seal. Oates returned
with a bad cut, as his hand had slipped down the knife;
and it was a long time before he was allowed to forget it.</p>

<p>This Barrier, which we were to know so well, was soft,
too soft for the ponies, and apparently flat. Only to our
left, some hundreds of yards distant, there were two little
snowy mounds. We got out the telescope which we carried,
but could make nothing of them. While we held our
ponies Scott walked towards them, and soon we saw him
brushing away snow and uncovering something dark beneath.
They were tents, obviously left by Shackleton or
his men when the Nimrod was embarking his Southern
party from the Barrier. They were snowed up outside, and
iced up inside almost to the caps. Afterwards we dug them
out, a good evening's work. The fabric was absolutely
rotten, we just tore it down with our hands, but the bamboos
and caps were as sound as ever. When we had dug
down to the floor-cloth we found everything intact as when
it was left. The cooker was there and a primus&mdash;Scott
lighted it and cooked a meal; we often used it afterwards.
And there were Rowntree's cocoa, Bovril, Brand's extract
of beef, sheep's tongues, cheese and biscuits&mdash;all open to
the snow and all quite good. We ate them for several days.
There is something impressive in these first meals off food
which has been exposed for years.</p>

<p>It was on a Saturday, January 28, that we took our first
load a short half-mile on to the Barrier and left it at a place
afterwards known as the Fodder Dep&ocirc;t. Two days later
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>we moved our camp 1 mile 1200 yards farther on to the
Barrier and here was erected the main dep&ocirc;t, known as
Safety Camp. 'Safety' because it was supposed that even
if a phenomenal break-up of sea-ice should occur, and take
with it part of the Barrier, this place would remain. Subsequent
events proved the supposition well founded. This
short bit of Barrier sledging gave all of us food for thought,
for the surface was appallingly soft, and the poor ponies
were sinking deep. It was obvious that no animals could
last long under such conditions. But somehow Shackleton
had got his four a long way.</p>

<p>There was now no hurry, for there was plenty of food.
It was only when we went on from here that we must
economize food and travel fast. It was determined to give
the ponies a rest while we made the dep&ocirc;t and rearranged
sledges, which we did on the following day. We had with us
one pair of pony snow-shoes, a circle of wire as a foundation,
hooped round with bamboo, and with beckets of the
same material. The surface suggested their trial, which
was completely successful. The question of snow-shoes
had been long and anxiously considered, and shoes for all
the ponies were at Cape Evans; but as we had so lately
landed from the ship the ponies had not been trained in
their use, and they had not been brought.</p>

<p>Scott immediately sent Wilson and Meares with a dog-team
to see whether the sea-ice would allow them to reach
Cape Evans and bring back shoes for the other ponies.
Meanwhile the next morning saw us trying to accustom
the animals to wearing snow-shoes by exercising them in
the one pair we possessed. But it seemed no use continuing
to do this after the dog party came in. They had found the
sea-ice gone between Glacier Tongue and Winter Quarters
and so were empty-handed. They reported that a crevasse
at the edge of the Tongue had opened under the sledge,
which had tilted back into the crevasse but had run over it.
These Glacier Tongue crevasses are shallow things; Gran
fell into one later and walked out of the side of the Tongue
on to the sea-ice beyond!</p>

<p>It was determined to start on the following day with five
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>weeks' provisions for men and animals; to go forward for
about fourteen days, dep&ocirc;t two weeks' provisions and
return. Most unfortunately Atkinson would have to be
left behind with Crean to look after him. He had chafed
his foot, and the chafe had suppurated. To his great disappointment
there was no alternative but to lie up. Luckily
we had another tent, and there was the cooker and primus
we had dug out of Shackleton's tent. Poor Crean was to
spend his spare time in bringing up loads from the Fodder
Dep&ocirc;t to Safety Camp and, worse still from his point of
view, dig a hole downwards into the Barrier for scientific
observations!</p>

<p>We left the following morning, February 2, and marched
on a patchy surface for five miles (Camp 4). The temperature
was above zero and Scott decided to see whether
the surface was not better at night. On the whole, it is
problematical whether this is the case&mdash;we came to the conclusion
later that the ideal surface for pulling a sledge on
ski was found at a temperature of about +16&deg;. But there
is no doubt whatever that ponies should do their work at
night, when the temperature is colder, and rest and sleep
when the sun has its greatest altitude and power. And so
we camped and turned in to our sleeping-bags at 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
and marched again soon after midnight, doing five miles
before and five miles after lunch: lunch, if you please, being
about 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and a very good time, for just then the daylight
seemed to be thin and bleak and one always felt the
cold.</p>

<p>Our road lay eastwards through the Strait, some twenty-five
miles in width, which runs between the low, rather uninteresting
scarp of White Island to the south, and the beautiful
slopes of Erebus and Terror to the north. This part
of the Barrier is stagnant, but the main stream in front of
us, unchecked by land, flows uninterruptedly northwards
towards the Ross Sea. Only where the stream presses
against the Bluff, White Island and, most important of all,
Cape Crozier, and rubs itself against the nearly stationary
ice upon which we were travelling, pressures and rendings
take place, forming some nasty crevasses. It was intended
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>to steer nearly east until this line was crossed some distance
north of White Island, and then steer due south.</p>

<p>It is most difficult on a large snow surface to say
whether it is flat. Certainly there are plenty of big crevasses
for several miles in this neighbourhood, though
they are generally well covered, and we found only very
small ones on this outward journey. I am inclined to think
there are also some considerable pressure waves. As we
came up to Camp 5 we floundered into a pocket of soft
snow in which one pony after another plunged deeper and
deeper until they were buried up to their bellies and could
move no more. I suppose it was an old crevasse filled with
soft snow, or perhaps one of the pressure-ridge hollows
which had been recently drifted up. My own pony somehow
got through with his sledge to the other side, and
every moment I expected the ground to fall below us
and a chasm to swallow us up. The others had to be unharnessed
and led out. The only set of snow-shoes was then
put on to Bowers' big pony and he went back and drew the
stranded sledges out. Beyond we pitched our camp.</p>

<p>On February 3-4 we marched for ten miles to Camp 6.
In the last five miles we crossed several crevasses, our first;
and I heard Oates ask some one what they looked like.
&quot;Black as hell,&quot; he said, but we saw no more just now, for
this march carried us beyond the line of pressure which
runs between White Island and Cape Crozier. This halt
was called Corner Camp, as we turned here and marched
due south. Corner Camp will be heard of again and again
in this story: it is thirty miles from Hut Point.</p>

<p>By 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> it was blowing our first Barrier blizzard. We
were to find out afterwards that a Corner Camp blizzard
blows nearly as often as a Hut Point wind. The Bluff seems
to be the breeding-place for these disturbances, which pour
out towards the sea by way of Cape Crozier. Corner Camp
is in the direct line between the two.</p>

<p>One summer blizzard is much like another. The temperature,
never very low, rises, and you are not cold in the
tent. Sometimes a blizzard is a very welcome rest: after
weeks of hard pulling, dragging yourself awake each
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>morning, feeling as though you had only just gone to sleep,
with the mental strain perhaps which work among crevasses
entails, it is most pleasant to be put to bed for two
or three days. You may sleep dreamlessly nearly all the
time, rousing out for meals, or waking occasionally to hear
from the soft warmth of your reindeer bag the deep boom
of the tent flapping in the wind, or drowsily you may visit
other parts of the world, while the drifting snow purrs
against the green tent at your head.</p>

<p>But outside there is raging chaos. It is blowing a full
gale: the air is full of falling snow, and the wind drives this
along and adds to it the loose snow which is lying on the
surface of the Barrier. Fight your way a few steps away
from the tent, and it will be gone. Lose your sense of
direction and there is nothing to guide you back. Expose
your face and hands to the wind, and they will very soon be
frost-bitten. And this at midsummer. Imagine the added
cold of spring and autumn: the cold and darkness of
winter.</p>

<p>The animals suffer most, and during this first blizzard
all our ponies were weakened, and two of them became
practically useless. It must be remembered that they had
stood for five weeks upon a heaving deck; they had been
through one very bad gale: the time during which we were
unloading the ship was limited, and since that time they had
dragged heavy loads the greater part of 200 miles. Nothing
was left undone for them which we could manage, but
necessarily the Antarctic is a grim place for ponies. I think
Scott felt the sufferings of the ponies more than the animals
themselves. It was different for the dogs. These fairly
warm blizzards were only a rest for them. Snugly curled
up in a hole in the snow they allowed themselves to be
drifted over. Bieleglas and Vaida, two half brothers who
pulled side by side, always insisted upon sharing one hole,
and for greater warmth one would lie on the top of the
other. At intervals of two hours or so they fraternally
changed places.</p>

<p>This blizzard lasted three days.</p>

<p>We now marched nearly due south, the open Barrier in
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>front, Mount Terror and the sea behind, for five days,
covering fifty-four miles, when, being now level with the
southern extremity of the Bluff, we laid the Bluff Dep&ocirc;t.
The bearings of Bluff Dep&ocirc;t, as well as those of Corner
Camp, are given in Scott's Last Expedition.</p>

<p>The characteristics of these days were the collapse of
two of the ponies, Bl&uuml;cher and Blossom, and the partial
collapse of a third, Jimmy Pigg, although the surface hardened,
becoming a marbled series of wind-swept ridges
and domes in this region. For the rest the new hands were
finding out how to keep warm on the Barrier, how to pitch
a tent and cook a meal in twenty minutes, and the thousand
and one little tips which only experience can teach. But
all the care in the world could do little for the poor ponies.</p>

<p>It must be confessed at once that some of these ponies
were very poor material, and it must be conceded that
Oates who was in charge of them started with a very great
handicap. From first to last it was Oates' consummate management,
seconded by the care and kindness of the ponies'
leaders, which obtained results which often exceeded the
most sanguine hopes.</p>

<p>One evening we watched Scott digging crumbly blocks
of snow out of the Barrier and building a rough wall,
something like a grouse butt, to the south of his pony.
In our inmost hearts I fear we viewed these proceedings
with distrust, and saw in it but little usefulness,&mdash;one little
bit of leaky wall in a great plain of snow. But a very little
wind (which you must understand comes almost invariably
from the south) convinced us from personal experience
what a boon these walls could be. Henceforward every
night on camping each pony leader built a wall behind his
pony while his pemmican was cooking, and came out after
supper to finish this wall before he turned in to his sleeping-bag&mdash;no
small thing when you consider that the warmth
of your hours of rest depends largely upon getting into
your bag immediately you have eaten your hoosh and cocoa.
And not seldom you might hear a voice in your dreams:
&quot;Bill! Nobby's kicked his wall down&quot;; and out Bill
would go to build it up again.</p>

<p>Oates wished to take certain of the ponies as far south
as possible on the Dep&ocirc;t journey, and then to kill them
and leave the meat there as a dep&ocirc;t of dog food for
the Polar Journey. Scott was against this plan. Here at
Bluff Dep&ocirc;t he decided to send back the three weakest
ponies (Blossom, Bl&uuml;cher and Jimmy Pigg, with their
leaders, Lieutenant Evans, Forde and Keohane). They
started back the next morning (February 13) while the
remainder of the party went forward over a surface which
gradually became softer as we left behind the windy region
of the Bluff. We now had with us the two teams of dogs,
driven by Meares and Wilson, and five ponies.</p>


<ul><li>Scott with 'Nobby.'</li>
<li>Oates with 'Punch.'</li>
<li>Bowers with 'Uncle Bill.'</li>
<li>Gran with 'Weary Willie.'</li>
<li>Cherry-Garrard with 'Guts.'</li>
</ul>

<p>Scott, Wilson, Meares and myself inhabited one tent,
Bowers, Oates and Gran the other. Scott was evolving in
his mind means by which ponies should follow one another
in a string, the second pony with his leading rein fastened
to the back of the sledge of the first and so on, the cavalcade
to be managed by two or three men only, instead
of one man to lead each pony.</p>

<p>Sunday night (February 12) we started from Bluff
Dep&ocirc;t and did seven miles before lunch against a considerable
drift and wind. It was pretty cold, and ten minutes
after we left our lunch camp with the ponies it was blowing
a full blizzard. The dog party had not started, so we
camped and slept five in the four-man tent, and it was by
no means uncomfortable. Probably this was the time when
Scott first thought of taking a five-man party to the Pole.
By Monday evening the blizzard was over, the dogs came
up, and we did 6&frac12; miles of very heavy going. Gran's pony,
Weary Willie, a sluggish and obstinate animal, was far
behind, as usual, when we halted our ponies at the camping
place. Farther off the dog-teams were coming up. What
happened never became clear. Poor Weary, it seems, was in
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>difficulties in a snow-drift: the dogs of one team being very
hungry took charge of their sledge and in a moment were
on the horse, to all purposes a pack of ravenous wolves.
Gran and Weary made a good fight and the dogs were
driven off, but Weary came into camp without his sledge,
covered with blood and looking very sick.</p>

<p>We halted after doing only &frac34; mile more after lunch; for
the pony was done, and little wonder. The following day
we did 7&frac12; miles with difficulty, both Uncle Bill and Weary
Willie going very slowly and stopping frequently. The
going was very deep. The ponies were fast giving out, and
it was evident that we had much to learn as to their use on
the Barrier; they were thin and very hungry; their rations
were unsatisfactory; and the autumn temperatures and
winds were beyond their strength. We went on one more
day in a minus twenty temperature and light airs, and then
in latitude 79&deg; 29&acute; S. it was determined to lay the dep&ocirc;t,
which was afterwards known as One Ton, and return. In
view of subsequent events it should be realized that this
dep&ocirc;t was just a cairn of snow in which were buried food
and oil, and over which a flag waved on a bamboo. There
is no land visible from One Ton except on a very clear day
and it is 130 geographical miles from Hut Point.</p>

<p>We spent a day making up the mound which contained
about a ton of provisions, oil, compressed fodder, oats and
other necessaries for the forthcoming Polar Journey. Scott
was satisfied with the result, and indeed this dep&ocirc;t ensured
that we could start southwards for the Pole fully laden from
this point.</p>

<p>Here the party was again split into two for the return.
Scott was anxious to get such news about the landing of
Campbell's party on King Edward VII.'s Land as the ship
should have left at Hut Point on her return journey. He
decided to take the two dog-teams, the first with himself
and Meares, the second with Wilson and myself, and make
a quick return, leaving Bowers with Oates and Gran to
help him to bring back the five ponies, driving them one
behind the other.<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Return Of The Pony Party From One Ton Dep&ocirc;t</span></h4>

<h5>(<i>From a Letter written by Bowers</i>)</h5>

<p>As our loads were so light Titus thought it would be
better for the ponies to do their full march in one stretch
and so have a longer rest. We, therefore, decided to forgo
lunch and have a good meal on camping. The recent trails
were fresh enough to follow and so saved us steering by
compass, which is very difficult as the needle will only come
to rest after you have been standing still for about a minute.
That march was extraordinary, the snowy mist hid all
distant objects and made all close ones look gigantic.
Although we were walking on a flat undulating plain, one
could not get away from the impression that the ground
was hilly&mdash;quite steep in places with deep hollows by the
wayside. Suddenly a herd of apparent cattle would appear
in the distance, then you would think, 'No, it's a team of
dogs broken loose and rushing towards you.' In another
moment one would be walking over the black dots of some
old horse droppings which had been the cause of the hallucinations.
Since then I have often been completely taken
in by appearances under certain conditions of light, and the
novelty has worn off. Sastrugi are the hard waves formed
by wind on a snow surface; these are seldom more than
a foot or so in height, and often so obscured as to be
imperceptible irregularities. On this occasion they often
appeared like immense ridges until you walked over them.
After going about 10 miles we spotted a tiny black triangle
in the dead white void ahead, it was over a mile away and
was the lunch camp of the dogs. We were fairly close
before they broke camp and hurriedly packed up. I
thought they looked rather sheepish at having been caught
up, like the hare and the tortoise again. Still we had been
marching very quickly and Scott was delighted to see
Weary Willie going so well. They then dashed off, and
after completing just over 12 miles we reached Pagoda
Cairn where a bale of fodder had been left.</p>

<p>Here we camped and threw up our walls as quickly as
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>possible to shelter the beasts from the cold wind. Weary
was the most annoying, he would deliberately back into
his wall and knock the whole structure down. In the case
of my own pony, I had to put the wall out of his reach as
his aim in life was to eat it, generally beginning at the
bottom. He would diligently dislodge a block, and bring
down the whole fabric. One cannot be angry with the silly
beggars&mdash;Titus says a horse has practically no reasoning
power, the thing to do is simply to throw up another wall
and keep on at it.</p>

<p>The weather cleared during the night, and the next day,
February 19, we started off under ideal conditions, the sun
was already dipping pretty low, marks easy to pick up,
and on this occasion we could plainly see a cairn over seven
miles away, raised by the mirage; the only trouble about
seeing things so far off is that they take such an awful time
to reach. Mirage is a great feature down here and one of
the most common of optical phenomena on the Barrier;
it is often difficult to persuade oneself that open water does
not lie ahead. We passed the scene of Weary Willie's fight
with the dogs during the march and also had an amusing
argument as to a dark object on the snow ahead. At first
we thought it was the dog camp again, but it turned out to
be an empty biscuit tin, such is the deceptive nature of the
light. Later we sighted our old blizzard camp and decided
to utilize the walls again. Weary Willie was decidedly
worse and had to be literally jumped along by the pony to
which he was attached. Within half a mile of the walls
Weary refused to go farther, and after wasting some time
in vain efforts to urge him on we had to camp where we
were, having only done 10&frac12; miles. This was very sad, but
I took hope from the fact that Titus, who is usually pretty
pessimistic, had not yet given up hopes of getting him
back alive. He had an extra whack of oats at the expense
of the other ponies, and my big beast made up for his
shortage by hauling the sledge towards him with his
tethered leg, and forcing his nose into our precious biscuit
tank, out of which he helped himself liberally at our expense.
The sledges were now too light to anchor the
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>animals, so we had to peg them down with anything we
could and bank them up with snow.</p>

<p>Weary was better the next day (February 20) but we
decided at the outset to go no farther than the Bluff Camp
where we had left some fodder. This was barely 10 miles
off, yet my old animal showed signs of lassitude before the
end; there was nothing alarming, however, and we saw
the dep&ocirc;t over five miles off which interested the beasts,
who see these things and somehow connect them, in the
backs of their silly old heads, with food and rest. Weary
Willie made a decided improvement, so we camped in high
spirits. Captain Scott had asked me if possible to take
some theodolite observations for the determination of the
position of Bluff Camp. Ours is much farther off and
farther beyond the Bluff than the old Discovery Dep&ocirc;t A,
which was practically the same position Shackleton used.
In both cases, Scott and Shackleton were keeping nearer
the coast; now, however, that the Beardmore has been discovered
we can aim straight for that, which takes one
farther east by at least 15 miles off the Bluff. This is rather
an advantage, I think, as close in to this remarkable headland
the onward movement of the Barrier arrested by the
immovable hills causes a terrific chaos of crevasses off the
cliffs at the end. These extend many miles and include
some chasms big enough to take the Terra Nova all standing.
Needless to remark, one is well clear of this sort of
scenery with ponies&mdash;hence our course. I was unable to
get any observations, unfortunately, as it clouded over almost
at once and later in the day started to snow without
wind. This often happens before a bliz, and as we were
anxious about the ponies to say nothing of our own shortage
of biscuit we felt a trifle apprehensive. It was very
gloomy when we left camp at midnight, as the midnight
sun was already cartwheeling the southern horizon, the
first sign of autumn, also the season had undoubtedly
broken up, and the sky was covered with low stratus clouds
as thick as a hedge. We lost sight of the cairn almost at
once and followed the remains of old tracks for a little while
till the snowy gloom made it impossible to see them. You
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>will remember that it was at the Bluff Camp that Teddy
Evans returned with the three weak ponies, so there were
plenty of traces of our march now. Just on four miles from
the start I saw a small mound some distance to the west,
and struck over there: it was a small cairn without the
signs of a camp and rather puzzled me at the time. As I
shall mention it later I will call it X for convenience. We
then pushed on and I found steering most difficult. In the
fuzzy nothingness ahead one could see no point on which to
fix the eye, and the compass required standing still to look
at it every time. Our sledging compasses are spirit ones,
and as steady as a small hand compass could possibly be.
You will understand, however, that owing to the proximity
of the Magnetic Pole the pull on the needle is chiefly downwards.
It is forced into a horizontal position by a balancing
weight on the N. side, so it is obvious that its direction
power is greatly reduced. On the ship, owing to the vibration
of the engines and the motors, we were absolutely
unable to steer by the compass at all when off the region
of the Magnetic Pole.</p>

<p>On this occasion (February 21) we zig-zagged all over
the place&mdash;first I went ahead, and Oates said I zig-zagged,
then he went ahead, and I understood at once, as it was
impossible to walk straight for two consecutive minutes.
However, we plodded along with frequent stoppages till
the wind came away, and then having determined the
direction of that, steered by keeping the snow on our backs.
The wind was not strong enough to be unpleasant, and all
was well. We legged it into the void for nearly seven miles
beyond X Cairn when I suddenly found myself only a few
yards away from another cairn. This shows that somehow,
without the use of tracks or landmarks, we had marched
seven miles without being able to see thirty yards, and had
yet hit off the direct track to a T; of course, it was only
coincidence, though some people might credit themselves
with superlative navigating powers on such evidence. The
wind increased, and with the knowledge I now have of
blizzards I would camp at once. Then I thought it better
to shove on, as the ponies were marching splendidly. The
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>danger lay in the fact that though it is easy enough for you to
march with the wind behind, you can't march for ever and
you will probably get tired before the wind does. Camping
in a stiff breeze is always difficult, to say nothing of a gale;
and for three men with five ponies to manage would be
wellnigh impossible. Fortunately for us this was not really
a blizzard, though it was quite near enough to one. The
sky broke later and showed the Bluff and White Island,
and then the scurrying clouds of drift would encircle us to
break again and come on again.</p>

<p>After having done seventeen miles we got a lull and
stopped to camp right away. We were pretty quick about
it, and fortunately got the ponies picketed, and tent pitched,
before the wind came down on us again. We were pretty
hungry by the time the walls were erected. Still we were
quite happy, ate everything we could get, except the three
lumps of sugar I always kept for old Uncle Bill out of my
whack. The little blow blew itself out towards evening and
in perfect calm and sunshine I got a splendid set of observations.
Erebus and Terror were showing up as clear as a
bell and I got a large number of angles for Evans' survey.
We started out as usual, and had the most pleasant, as well
as the longest, of our return marches on the last day of
summer, February 22. We did eighteen miles right off
the reel, the sun was brilliant from midnight onwards. He
now half immersed himself below the horizon for a short
interval once in 24 hours. All old cairns were visible a
tremendous distance, six or seven miles at least for big
ones. Mount Terror lay straight ahead and looked so clear
that it seemed impossible to imagine it 70 miles away. At
the end of our march we saw a small cairn beyond our 8th
outward camp mound. Nobody would have rigged up
another cairn so close without an object, so the thought of
a dead horse flashed through my mind at once. Titus was
so sure that Bl&uuml;cher would never get back, that he had bet
Gran a biscuit on it. I saw the cairn had a fodder bale on
the top, and later saw a note made fast to the wire. It was
in Teddy Evans' handwriting and to our surprise recorded
Blossom's death. Titus was so sure that Blossom would
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>survive Bl&uuml;cher that we started to think back and thus the
mystery of X Cairn was clear to me. I was quite certain
now that both the ancient ponies had died and that Jimmy
Pigg had returned alone. The following day (February 23)
was a good marching day also, but a bit cloudy latterly.
We did fourteen miles as this evidence of pony failure made
us all the more anxious about ours, though really they were
going very well. About eight miles on we came to one of
Evans' camps and the solitary pony wall told its own tale
of the death of the other two. He must have had a miserable
return. At eleven miles there were two bales of fodder
dep&ocirc;ted, we were only 50 miles odd from our destination
off Cape Armitage, and had one meal over three days' food.
If, therefore, we could average 15 miles a day that would
suffice. It was a silly risk in view of blizzards and other
possibilities, chiefly our own inexperience. As it was I took
it and left the fodder there for next year.</p>

<p>February 24 was another march into impenetrable
gloom. Fortunately Corner Camp, though dark enough,
was not shaded in mist. I examined it for notes and evidence
and found some. The sun set properly now, and had
we been farther from home I should have changed to day
marching. I have seldom seen such a scene of utter desolation
as Corner Camp presented on that gloomy day. The
fog then settled down and like people of the mist, we
struck off blindly to the N.W. At 3.15 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> a light S.
breeze came away; I dreaded a blizzard with so little pony
food, and already regretted my folly in leaving the fodder.
After doing twelve miles we had to camp, as it was impossible
even to march straight in the white haze. We made
five colossal walls and turned in, hoping for the best. Fortune
favours the reckless, as well as the brave, at times, and
it did this time, as the blizzard still held off. The signs of
one impending were unmistakable notwithstanding. Weary
Willie did less well on February 25, and as the surface became
heavier, we had to camp after only doing eleven miles.</p>

<p>I thought best in view of the threatening appearance of
the weather to have a six hours' rest, and march into Safety
Camp the same day, a distance of eight miles. We found
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>to our horror that Gran had dropped the top cap of our
primus at the last camp. Cold food stared us in face!</p>

<p>However, we did manage to melt some snow for a
cheering drink by cutting a piece of tin as near the shape of
the cap as possible. Our biscuit was finished owing to the
ravages of my pony. Before turning in I saw some specks
to the N. and skipping my theodolite on its tripod, looked
through the telescope and saw two tents and a number of
ski stuck up. [This was Scott's man-hauling party together
with Jimmy Pigg, going out to Corner Camp.] This we
concluded was either a man-hauling, or man and beast
party bound for Corner Camp. We overslept and so did
not get away till the afternoon. It was still very cloudy and
threatening. I found that I had steered considerably to the
southward of the right direction in the fog, and it is lucky
we met with no crevasses off White Island. Safety Camp
at last appeared, and the last four miles seemed interminable.
We had given the animals their last feed before
starting, not a particle remained, but they stuck it. The
surface was very heavy. Once, however, that they had seen
the camp they never stopped. I suppose they knew they
were nearly home. We marched in about 9.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I said
'Thank God' when I looked at the weather, and the empty
sledges. The dogs were in camp, also the dome tent [we
had some tents shaped like a dome in addition to those we
used for sledging], out of which Uncle Bill (the real 'Uncle
Bill Wilson') and Meares emerged. We soon had the
ponies behind walls and well fed, borrowed their primus for
ourselves, and had a square meal of pemmican and biscuit
with fids of seal liver in it.</p>

<h4 class="smcap">The Return Of The Dog Party</h4>

<p>The history of the dog-teams was eventful. We travelled
fast, doing nearly 78 miles in the first three days, by which
time we were approaching Corner Camp. The dogs were
thin and hungry and we were pushing them each day just
so long as they could pull, running ourselves for the most
part. Scott determined to cut the corner, that is to miss<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
Corner Camp and cut diagonally across our outward track.
It was not expected that this would bring us across any
badly crevassed area.</p>

<p>We started on the evening of February 20 in a very bad
light. It was coldish, with no wind. After going about
three miles I saw a drop in the level of the Barrier which
the sledge was just going to run over. I shouted to Wilson
to look out, but he had already jumped on to the sledge
(for he was running) having seen Stareek put his paws
through. It was a nasty crevasse, about twenty feet across
with blue holes on both sides. The sledge ran over and
immediately on the opposite side was brought up by a
large 'haystack' of pressure which we had not seen owing
to the light. Meares' team, on our left, never saw any sign
of pressure. The light was so bad that we never saw this
cairn of ice until we ran into it.</p>

<p>We ran level for another two miles, Meares and Scott
on our left. We were evidently crossing many crevasses.
Quite suddenly we saw the dogs of their team disappearing,
following one another, just like dogs going down a hole
after some animal.</p>

<p>&quot;In a moment,&quot; wrote Scott, &quot;the whole team were
sinking&mdash;two by two we lost sight of them, each pair
struggling for foothold. Osman the leader exerted all his
strength and kept a foothold&mdash;it was wonderful to see him.
The sledge stopped and we leapt aside. The situation was
clear in another moment. We had been actually travelling
along the bridge [or snow covering] of a crevasse, the
sledge had stopped on it, whilst the dogs hung in their
harness in the abyss, suspended between the sledge and
the leading dog. Why the sledge and ourselves didn't
follow the dogs we shall never know.&quot;</p>

<p>We of the other sledge stopped hurriedly, tethered
our team and went to their assistance with the Alpine
rope. Osman, the big leader, was in great difficulties. He
crouched resisting with all his enormous strength the pull
of the rope upon which the team hung in their harness in
mid air. It was clear that if Osman gave way the sledge
and dogs would probably all be lost down the crevasse.<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></p>

<p>First we pulled the sledge off the crevasse, and drove
the tethering peg and driving stick through the cross
pieces to hold it firm. Scott and Meares then tried to pull
up the rope from Osman's end, while we hung on to the
sledge to prevent it slipping down the crevasse. They
could not move it an inch. We then put the strain as
much as possible on to a peg. Meanwhile two dogs had
fallen out of their harness into the crevasse and could be
seen lying on a snow-ledge some 65 feet down. Later
they curled up and went to sleep. Another dog as he
hung managed to get some purchase for his feet on the
side of the crevasse, and a free fight took place among
several more of them, as they dangled, those that hung
highest using the backs of those under them to get a purchase.</p>

<p>&quot;It takes one a little time,&quot; wrote Scott, &quot;to make
plans under such sudden circumstances, and for some
minutes our efforts were rather futile. We could not get
an inch on the main trace of the sledge or on the leading
rope, which was binding Osman to the snow with a throttling
pressure. Then thought became clearer. We unloaded
our sledge, putting in safety our sleeping-bags with
the tent and cooker. Choking sounds from Osman made
it clear that the pressure on him must soon be relieved.
I seized the lashing off Meares' sleeping-bag, passed the
tent poles across the crevasse, and with Meares managed
to get a few inches on the leading line; this freed Osman,
whose harness was immediately cut.</p>

<p>&quot;Then securing the Alpine rope to the main trace we
tried to haul up together. One dog came up and was unlashed,
but by this time the rope had cut so far back at the
edge that it was useless to attempt to get more of it. But
we could now unbend the sledge, and do that for which we
should have aimed from the first, namely, run the sledge
across the gap and work from it. We managed to do this,
our fingers constantly numbed. Wilson held on to the
anchored trace whilst the rest of us laboured at the leader
end. The leading rope was very small and I was fearful of
its breaking, so Meares was lowered down a foot or two to
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>secure the Alpine rope to the leading end of the trace; this
done, the work of rescue proceeded in better order. Two
by two we hauled the animals up to the sledge and one by
one cut them out of their harness. Strangely the last dogs
were the most difficult, as they were close under the lip of
the gap, bound in by the snow-covered rope. Finally, with
a gasp we got the last poor creature on to firm snow. We
had recovered eleven of the thirteen.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The dogs had been dangling for over an hour, and some
of them showed signs of internal injuries. Meanwhile the
two remaining dogs were lying down the crevasse on a
snow-ledge. Scott proposed going down on the Alpine
rope to get them; all his instincts of kindness were aroused,
as well as the thought of the loss of two of the team.
Wilson thought it was a mad idea and very dangerous, and
said so, asking however whether he might not go down
instead of Scott if anybody had to go. Scott insisted, and
we paid down the 90-foot Alpine rope to test the distance.
The ledge was about 65 feet below. We lowered Scott,
who stood on the ledge while we hauled up the two dogs
in turn. They were glad to see him, and little wonder!</p>

<p>But the rescued dogs which were necessarily running
about loose on the Barrier, in their mangled harnesses,
chose this moment to start a free fight with the other team.
With a hurried shout down the crevasse we had to rush off
to separate them. Nougis I. had been considerably mauled
before this was done&mdash;also, incidentally, my heel! But at
last we separated them, and hauled Scott to the surface. It
was all three of us could do and our fingers were frost-bitten
towards the end.</p>

<p>Scott's interest in the incident, apart from the recovery
of the dogs, was scientific. Since we were running across
the line of cleavage when the dogs went down, it was to be
expected that we should be crossing the crevasses at right
angles, and not be travelling, as actually happened, parallel
to, or along them. While we were getting him up the sixty
odd feet to which we had lowered him he kept muttering:
&quot;I wonder why this is running the way it is&mdash;you expect
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>to find them at right angles,&quot; and when down the crevasse
he wanted to go off exploring, but we managed to persuade
him that the snow-ledge upon which he was standing was
utterly unsafe, and indeed we could see the nothingness
below through the blue holes in the shelf. Another regret
was that we had no thermometer: the temperature of the
inside of the Barrier is of great interest and a fairly reliable
record of the average temperature throughout the year
might have been obtained when so far down into it. Altogether
we could congratulate ourselves on a fortunate
ending to a nasty business. We expected several more
miles of crevasses, and the wind was getting up, driving
the surface drift like smoke over the ground, with a very
black sky to the south. We pitched the tent, had a good
meal and mended the dog harness which had been ruthlessly
cut in clearing the dogs. Luckily we found no more
crevasses for it was now blowing hard, and rescue work
would have been difficult, and we pushed on as far as
possible that night, doing eleven miles after lunch, and
sixteen for the day. It had been strenuous, for we had been
working in or over the crevasse for 2&frac12; hours, and dogs
and men were tired out. It cleared and became quite warm
as we camped. There was a pleasant air of friendship in
the tent that night, rather more than usual. That is generally
the result of this kind of business.</p>

<p>We reached Safety Camp next day (February 22)
anxious for news of the ship's doings, the landing of
Campbell's party, and of the ponies which had been sent
back from the Bluff Dep&ocirc;t. Lieutenant Evans, Forde and
Keohane, the pony leaders, were there, but only one pony.
The other two had died of exhaustion soon after they left us
and we had passed the cairns which marked their graves
without knowledge. Their story was grim, and they had
had a mournful journey back. First Blossom, and then
Bl&uuml;cher collapsed, their ends being hastened by the blizzard
of February 1.</p>

<p>This crevasse incident, followed by the news of the loss
of the ponies, was a blow to Scott, and his mind was also
uneasy about Atkinson and Crean, whom we had left here,
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>and who had disappeared leaving no record. Nor was the
report from the Terra Nova here, so we judged that the
missing men and the report must be at Hut Point. After
three or four hours' sleep, and a cup of tea and a biscuit,
we started man-hauling with cooker and sleeping-bags: the
former because we were to have our good meal at the hut,
the latter in case we were hung up. Travelling over the sea-ice
as far as the Gap, from which we saw that the open sea
reached to Hut Point, we made our way into the hut, and
there was a mystery. The accumulations of ice which we
found in it were dug away: there was a notice outside
dated February 8 saying, &quot;mail for Captain Scott is in bag
inside south door.&quot; We hunted everywhere, but there was
no Atkinson nor Crean, nor mail, nor the things which the
ship was to have brought. All kinds of wild theories were
advanced. By the presence of a fresh onion and some bread
it was clear that the ship's party had been there, but the
rest was utterly vague. It was then suggested that we were
expected back about this time, and that the missing men
had been sledging to Safety Camp round Cape Armitage
on the very shaky sea-ice while we passed them as we came
through the Gap. Sledge tracks were found leading on to
the sea-ice: we started back in doubt. Scott was terribly
anxious, we were all tired, and the dep&ocirc;t never seemed to
come nearer. It was not until we were some two hundred
yards from it that we saw the extra tent. &quot;Thank God!&quot;
I heard Scott mutter under his breath, and &quot;I believe you
were even more anxious than I was, Bill.&quot;</p>

<p>Atkinson had the ship's mail, signed by Campbell.
&quot;Every incident of the day,&quot; Scott wrote, &quot;pales before the
startling contents of the mail-bag which Atkinson gave me&mdash;a
letter from Campbell setting out his doings and the
finding of Amundsen established in the Bay of Whales.&quot;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-17.jpg"><img src="./images/1-17_th.jpg" alt="Hut Point&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." title="Hut Point&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Hut Point</span>&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del.</p>
<hr />


<p>Strongly as Scott tries to word this, it quite fails to convey
how he felt, and how we all felt more or less, in spite
of the warning conveyed in the telegram from Madeira
to Melbourne. For an hour or so we were furiously
angry, and were possessed with an insane sense that we
must go straight to the Bay of Whales and have it out with<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>
Amundsen and his men in some undefined fashion or other
there and then. Such a mood could not and did not bear
a moment's reflection; but it was natural enough. We
had just paid the first instalment of the heart-breaking
labour of making a path to the Pole; and we felt, however
unreasonably, that we had earned the first right of way.
Our sense of co-operation and solidarity had been wrought
up to an extraordinary pitch; and we had so completely
forgotten the spirit of competition that its sudden intrusion
jarred frightfully. I do not defend our burst of rage&mdash;for
such it was&mdash;I simply record it as an integral human part
of my narrative. It passed harmlessly; and Scott's account
proceeds as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;One thing only fixes itself definitely in my mind.
The proper, as well as the wiser, course for us is to proceed
exactly as though this had not happened. To go forward
and do our best for the honour of the country without fear
or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen's plan is a
very serious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to
the Pole by 60 miles&mdash;I never thought he could have got
so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan of running them
seems excellent. But, above and beyond all, he can start
his journey early in the season&mdash;an impossible condition
with ponies.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>We read that on leaving McMurdo Sound the Terra
Nova coasted eastward along the Barrier face, with Campbell
and his men who were to be landed on King Edward
VII.'s Land if possible. She surveyed the face of the
Barrier as she went from Cape Crozier to longitude 170&deg;
W., whence she shaped a course direct for Cape Colbeck,
which Priestley states in his diary &quot;is only 200 feet high
according to our measurement and looks uncommonly like
common or garden Barrier.&quot;</p>

<p>Here they met heavy pack, and were forced to return
without finding any place where the cliff was low enough
to allow Campbell and his five men to land. They coasted
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>back, making for an inlet known as Balloon Bight. Priestley
tells the story:</p>

<p>&quot;February 1, 1911. Our trip has not been without
outcome after all, and all our doubts about wintering here
or in South Victoria Land have been settled in a startling
fashion. About ten o'clock we steamed into a deep bay in
the Barrier which proved to be Shackleton's Bay of Whales,
and our observations in the last expedition [Shackleton's]
have been wonderfully upheld. Our present sights and
angles Pennell tells me are almost a duplicate of those that
we got. Every one has always been doubtful about the Bay
of Whales we reported, but now the matter has been set at
rest finally. There is no doubt now that Balloon Bight and
the neighbouring bay marked on the Discovery's chart
have become merged into one, and further, that since that
period the resulting bight has broken back considerably
more: indeed it seems to have altered a good deal on its
western border since our visit to it in 1908. Otherwise it
is the same, the same deceptive caves and shadows having
from a distance the appearance of rock exposures, the same
pressure-ridged cliffs, the same undulations behind, the
same expanse of sea-ice and even the same crowds of whales.
I hope that before we leave we shall find it possible to survey
the bight, but that depends on the weather. It was satisfactory
to find all our observations coming right and everybody
backing up Shackleton, and I turned in last night
feeling quite cheerful and believing that there would be
a really good chance of the Eastern Party finding a home
on the Barrier here&mdash;our last chance of surveying King
Edward's Land.</p>

<p>&quot;However, man proposes but God disposes, and I was
waked up by Lillie at one o'clock this morning by the
astounding news that there was a ship in the bay at anchor
to the sea-ice. All was confusion on board for a few minutes,
everybody rushing up on deck with cameras and clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;It was no false alarm, there she was within a few yards
of us, and what is more, those of us who had read Nansen's
books recognized the Fram.</p>

<p>&quot;She is rigged with fore and aft sails and as she has
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>petrol engines she has no funnel. Soon afterwards the men
forward declared that they sighted a hut on the Barrier, and
the more excited declared that there was a party coming
out to meet us. Campbell, Levick, and myself were therefore
lowered over the side of the ship while she was being
made fast, and set off on ski towards the dark spot we could
see. This proved to be only an abandoned dep&ocirc;t and we
returned to the ship, where Campbell, who in his anxiety
to be the first to meet them had left us beginners far behind,
had opened up conversation with the night watchman.</p>

<p>&quot;He informed us that there were only three men on
board and that the remainder of them were settling Amundsen
in winter quarters about as far from the dep&ocirc;t as the
dep&ocirc;t was from the ship. Amundsen is coming to visit
the Fram to-morrow, and we are staying long enough
to allow Pennell and Campbell to interview him. They
reached the pack about January 6 and were through it by
the 12th, so they did not have as bad a time as we did.
They inform us that Amundsen does not intend to make
his descent on the Pole until next year. This is encouraging
as it means a fair race for the next summer, though
the news we are bringing to them will keep the Western
[Main] Party on tenterhooks of excitement all the winter.</p>

<p>&quot;Our plans have of course been decided for us. We
cannot according to etiquette trench on their winter quarters,
but must return to McMurdo Sound and then go off
towards Robertson Bay and settle ourselves as best we can.
While we are waiting events we have not been by any
means idle. Rennick got a sounding, 180 fathoms, and
the crew have killed three seals, including one beautiful
silver crab-eater, Lillie has secured water samples at 50,
100, 150, and 170 fathoms and has had a haul with the
plankton net, and Williams is endeavouring to fit up the
trawl for a haul to-morrow if we get time and appropriate
weather. I got a roll of films and gave the roll to Drake to
take home and get developed in Christchurch. There are
photographs of the Fram, of the Fram and Terra Nova
together, of their dep&ocirc;t, and of the ice-cliffs and the sea-ice
which is decidedly overcut, the thick snow having been
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>removed in places by the swell until a ledge several yards
wide is lying just submerged.</p>

<p>&quot;It has been calm all the night with the snow falling
at intervals.</p>

<p>&quot;February 4, 1911. I was waked at seven o'clock this
morning by Levick demanding the loan of my camera. It
appears that Amundsen, Johansen and six men had arrived
at the Fram this morning at about 6.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and had come
over to interview Campbell and Pennell. Campbell, Pennell
and Levick then went back to breakfast with them and
stayed until nearly noon when they returned telling us to
expect Amundsen, Nilsen, the first lieutenant of the Fram
who is taking her back after landing the party, and a young
lieutenant whose name none of us caught, to lunch. After
lunch a party of officers and men went to see the rest of the
Norwegians, see over the ship, and say good-bye. I did
not go and was able to show Lieut. Jensen over the ship in
the meantime. About three o'clock we let go the ice anchor
and parted from the Fram, steaming along the ice very
slowly in order to dredge from 190 to 300 fathoms. The
haul was successful, about two bucketsful of the muddy
bottom being secured, and a still more valuable catch from
the biological point of view were two long crinoids, about
a couple of feet in length and in fairly perfect condition,
which had become attached to the outside of the net.</p>

<p>&quot;We are now standing along the Barrier continuing
our survey to the bight we first struck, after which we sail
to Cape Evans, stay a day there and then make up North to
try and effect a lodgment on the coast beyond Cape Adare.</p>

<p>&quot;During the morning Browning and I examined the
ice-face forming the eastern face of the bight. We found
it to be made of clear ice of grain from a quarter to three-eighths
of an inch in size and full of bubbles.</p>

<p>&quot;On the way there I took a couple of photographs of
some of Amundsen's dogs, and when we were there I got
a few of crevasses and caves in the Barrier face.</p>

<p>&quot;Well! we have left the Norwegians and our thoughts
are full, too full, of them at present. The impression they
have left with me is that of a set of men of distinctive per<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>sonality,
hard, and evidently inured to hardship, good goers
and pleasant and good-humoured. All these qualities combine
to make them very dangerous rivals, but even did one
want not to, one cannot help liking them individually in
spite of the rivalry.</p>

<p>&quot;One thing I have particularly noticed is the way in
which they are refraining from getting information from
us which might be useful to them. We have news which
will make the Western Party as uneasy as ourselves and the
world will watch with interest a race for the Pole next year,
a race which may go any way, and may be decided by luck
or by dogged energy and perseverance on either side.</p>

<p>&quot;The Norwegians are in dangerous winter quarters, for
the ice is breaking out rapidly from the Bay of Whales
which they believe to be Borchgrevink's Bight, and they
are camped directly in front of a distinct line of weakness.
On the other hand if they get through the winter safely
(and they are aware of their danger), they have unlimited
dogs, the energy of a nation as northern as ourselves, and
experience with snow-travelling that could be beaten by no
collection of men in the world.</p>

<p>&quot;There remains the Beardmore Glacier. Can their
dogs face it, and if so, who will get there first. One thing I
feel and that is that our Southern Party will go far before
they permit themselves to be beaten by any one, and I
think that two parties are very likely to reach the Pole next
year, but God only knows which will get there first.</p>

<p>&quot;A few of the things we learnt about the Norwegians
are as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;The engines of the Fram occupy only half the size of
our wardroom, the petrol tanks have not needed replenishment
since they left Norway, and their propeller can be
lifted by three men. They kept fresh potatoes from Norway
to the Barrier. (Some of them must surely be renegade
Irishmen.) They have each a separate cabin 'tween-decks
in the Fram, and are very comfortable. They are using for
transporting their stores to the hut, eight teams of five
dogs each, working every alternate day.</p>

<p>&quot;They intend to use for the Polar Journey teams of
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>ten dogs, each team working one day out of two. Their
dogs stop at a whistle, and if they make a break they can be
stopped by overturning the sledge, empty or full as the
case may be. They are nine in the shore party and ten in
the ship. Their ship is going back to Buenos Ayres with
Nilsen in charge and during the winter is to encircle the
world, sounding all the way.</p>

<p>&quot;They are not starting on the dash South this year and
do not yet know whether they will lay dep&ocirc;ts this year.
They have 116 dogs and ten of these are bitches, so that
they can rear pups, and have done so very successfully on
the way out. The Fram acts like a cork in the sea; she rolls
tremendously but does not ship water, and during the
voyage they have had the dogs running loose about the
decks. There is a lot more miscellaneous information, but
I may remember it more coherently a little later when
the main impressions of the rencontre are a little more
faint.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>It will be seen that Priestley missed three points. First,
he was left with a conventional but very erroneous impression of
Amundsen as a blunt Norwegian sailor, not in the least
an intellectual. Second, he thought Amundsen had camped
on the ice and not on terra firma. Third, he thought Amundsen
was going to the Pole by the old route over the
Beardmore. The truth was that Amundsen was an explorer
of the markedly intellectual type, rather Jewish than
Scandinavian, who had proved his sagacity by discovering
solid footing for the winter by pure judgment. For the
moment, let it be confessed, we all underrated Amundsen,
and could not shake off the feeling that he had stolen a
march on us.</p>

<p>Back to McMurdo Sound, and the news left at Hut
Point. Then the two ponies which had been allotted to
Campbell were swum ashore at Cape Evans, since he
thought that now they would be of more use to Scott than
to himself. Subsequent events proved the extreme usefulness
of this unselfish act. The Terra Nova would steam
north and try and land Campbell's party on the extreme
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>northern shores of Queen Victoria Land. At the same time
there was so little coal left that it might be necessary to
go straight back to New Zealand. Campbell regretted not
being able to see Scott, supposing that the altered circumstances
caused Scott to wish to rearrange his parties, and
also because Amundsen had asked Campbell to land his
party at the Bay of Whales, giving him the area to the east
to explore, and Campbell did not wish to accept before
getting Scott's permission.</p>

<p>As we know now coal ran so short that it came to an
alternative of dumping Campbell, his men and gear hastily
on the beach at Cape Adare, or taking them back to New
Zealand. As one member of the crew said: &quot;Exploring is
all very well in its way, but it is a thing which can be very
easily overdone.&quot; The ship was as ready to get rid of them
as they were to get rid of the ship. They were landed,
working to their waists in the surf, and the ship got safely
back to New Zealand.</p>

<p>Scott decided that the period of waiting until the pony
party arrived from One Ton should be employed in sledging
stores out to Corner Camp. But the dog-teams were
done, &quot;the dogs are thin as rakes; they are ravenous and
very tired. I feel this should not be, and that it is evident
that they are underfed. The ration must be increased next
year and we must have some properly-thought-out diet.
The biscuit alone is not good enough.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In addition,
several dogs were feeling the effects of injuries due to the
crevasse incident. There remained the men and the one
pony which had survived out of the three sent back from
Bluff Dep&ocirc;t, namely Jimmy Pigg.</p>

<p>The party started on Friday, February 24, marching
by day. It consisted of Scott, Crean and myself with one
sledge and tent, Lieutenant Evans, Atkinson and Forde
with a second sledge and tent, and Keohane leading James
Pigg. On the second night out we saw the pony party
pass us in the distance on their way to Safety Camp.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> At
Corner Camp Scott decided to leave Lieutenant Evans'<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>
party to come in with the pony more slowly, and himself
to push on with Crean and myself at top speed for Safety
Camp. We made a forced march well into the night, doing
twenty-six miles for the day, and camped some ten miles
from Safety Camp, where the pony party must by this
time have arrived.</p>

<p>The events which followed were disastrous, and the
steps which led to a catastrophe which entailed the loss of
much of our best transport, and only by a miracle did not
lead to the loss of several lives, were complicated. At this
moment, the night of February 26, there were three parties
on the Barrier. Behind Scott was Lieutenant Evans' party
and the pony, James Pigg. Scott himself was camped
within easy marching distance of Safety Camp with Crean
and myself. At Safety Camp were the two dog-teams with
Wilson and Meares, while the pony party from One Ton
Dep&ocirc;t had just arrived with five ponies which were for the
most part thin, hungry and worn. Between Safety Camp
and Hut Point lay the frozen sea, which might or might
not break up this year, but we knew from our observations
a few days before that the ice was in a shaky condition.
At that time the ice sheet extended some seven miles to
the north of Hut Point. The season was fast closing in:
temperatures of fifty or sixty degrees of frost had been
common for the last fortnight, and this was bad for the
ponies. We had been unfortunate in having several severe
blizzards, and it was already clear that it was these autumn
blizzards more than cold temperatures and soft surfaces
which the ponies could not endure. Scott was most anxious
to get the animals into such shelter as we could make for
them at Hut Point.</p>

<p>The next morning, February 27, we woke to a regular
cold autumn blizzard&mdash;very thick, wind force 9 and temperature
about minus twenty. This was disheartening, and
indeed with our six worn ponies still on the Barrier the
outlook for them was discouraging. The blizzard came to
an end the next morning. Scott must take up the first part
of that day's story:</p>

<p>&quot;Packed up at 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and marched into Safety Camp.<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>
Found every one very cold and depressed. Wilson and
Meares had had continuous bad weather since we left,
Bowers and Oates since their arrival. The blizzard had
raged for two days. The animals looked in a sorry condition,
but all were alive. The wind blew keen and cold from
the east. There could be no advantage in waiting here, and
soon all arrangements were made for a general shift to Hut
Point. Packing took a long time. The snowfall had been
prodigious, and parts of the sledges were 3 or 4 feet under
drift. About 4 o'clock the two dog-teams got safely away.
Then the pony party prepared to go. As the cloths were
stript from the ponies the ravages of the blizzard became
evident. The animals, without exception, were terribly
emaciated, and Weary Willie was in a pitiable condition.</p>

<p>&quot;The plan was for the ponies to follow the dog tracks,
our small party to start last and get in front of the ponies
on the sea-ice. I was very anxious about the sea-ice passage
owing to the spread of the water holes.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The two dog-teams left with Meares and Wilson some
time before the ponies, and for the moment they go out of
this story.</p>

<p>Bowers' pony, Uncle Bill, was ready first, and he
started with him. We got three more ponies harnessed,
Punch, Nobby and Guts, and tried to harness Weary
Willie, but when we attempted to lead him forward he
immediately fell down.</p>

<p>Scott rapidly reorganized. He sent Crean and me forward
with the three better ponies to join Bowers, now
waiting a mile ahead. Oates and Gran he kept with himself,
to try and help the sick pony. His diary tells how &quot;we
made desperate efforts to save the poor creature, got him
once more on his legs, gave him a hot oat mash. Then,
after a wait of an hour, Oates led him off, and we packed
the sledge and followed on ski; 500 yards from the camp
the poor creature fell again and I felt it was the last effort.
We camped, built a snow wall round him, and did all we
possibly could to get him on his feet. Every effort was
fruitless, though the poor thing made pitiful struggles.<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>
Towards midnight we propped him up as comfortably as
we could and went to bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Wednesday, March 1. <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Our pony died in the
night. It is hard to have got him back so far only for this.
It is clear that these blizzards are terrible for the poor
animals. Their coats are not good, but even with the best
of coats it is certain they would lose condition badly if
caught in one, and we cannot afford to lose condition at the
beginning of a journey. It makes a late start necessary for
next year.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we have done our best and bought our experience
at a heavy cost. Now every effort must be bent on
saving the remaining animals.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>A letter from Bowers home, which certainly does not
overstate the adventures of himself and the two men sent
forward to join him, is probably the best description of
the incidents which followed. It will be remembered that
Crean and I with three ponies were sent from Safety Camp
to join him: he was already leading one pony. Night was
beginning to fall, and the light was bad, but from the edge
of the Barrier the two dog-teams could still be seen as black
dots in the distance towards Cape Armitage.</p>

<p>&quot;On the night of February 28 I led off with my pony
and was surprised at the delay in the others leaving&mdash;knowing
nothing of Weary's collapse. Over the edge of
the Barrier I went, and at the bottom of the snow incline
awaited the others. To my surprise Cherry and Crean appeared
with Punch, Nobby and Guts in a string, and then
I heard the reason for Oates and Scott not having come on.
My orders were to push on to Hut Point over the sea-ice
without delay, and to follow the dogs; previously I had
been told to camp on the sea-ice only in case of the beasts
being unable to go on. We had four pretty heavy sledges,
as we were taking six weeks' man food and oil to the hut, as
well as a lot of gear from the dep&ocirc;t, and pony food, etc.
Unfortunately the dogs misunderstood their orders and,
instead of piloting us, dashed off on their own. We saw
them like specks in the distance in the direction of the old
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>seal crack. Having crossed this they wheeled to the right
in the direction of Cape Armitage and disappeared into a
black indefinite mist, which seemed to pervade everything
in that direction. We heard afterwards that in a mile or two
they came to some alarming signs and, turning, made for
the Gap where they got up on to the land about midnight.</p>

<p>&quot;I plugged on in their tracks, till we came to the seal
crack which was an old pressure-ridge running many miles
S.W. from Pram Point. We considered the ice behind this
crack&mdash;over which we had just come&mdash;fast ice; it was older
ice than that beyond, as it had undoubtedly frozen over
first. Having crossed the crack we streaked on for Cape
Armitage. The animals were going badly, owing to the
effects of the blizzard, and frequent stoppages were necessary.
On coming to some shaky ice we headed farther west
as there were always some bad places off the cape, and I
thought it better to make a good circuit. Crean, who had
been over the ice recently, told me it was all right farther
round. However, about a mile farther on I began to have
misgivings; the cracks became too frequent to be pleasant,
and although the ice was from five to ten feet thick, one
does not like to see water squelching between them, as we
did later. It spells motion, and motion on sea-ice means
breakage. I shoved on in the hope of getting on better ice
round the cape, but at last came a moving crack, and that
decided me to turn back. We could see nothing owing to
the black mist, everything looked solid as ever, but I knew
enough to mistrust moving ice, however solid it seemed.
It was a beastly march back: dark, gloomy and depressing.
The beasts got more and more down in their spirits and
stopped so frequently that I thought we would never reach
the seal crack. I said to Cherry, however, that I would take
no risks, and camp well over the other side on the old sound
ice if we could get there. This we managed to do eventually.
Here there was soft snow, whereas on the sea side of
the crack it was hard: that is the reason we lost the dogs'
tracks at once on crossing. Even over this crack I thought
it best to march as far in as possible. We got well into the
bay, as far as our exhausted ponies would drag, before I
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>camped and threw up the walls, fed the beasts, and retired
to feed ourselves. We had only the primus with the missing
cap and it took over 1&frac12; hours to heat up the water; however,
we had a cup of pemmican. It was very dark, and I
mistook a small bag of curry powder for the cocoa bag,
and made cocoa with that, mixed with sugar; Crean drank
his right down before discovering anything was wrong.
It was 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> before we were ready to turn in. I went out
and saw everything quiet: the mist still hung to the west,
but you could see a good mile and all was still. The sky
was very dark over the Strait though, the unmistakable
sign of open water. I turned in. Two and a half hours later
I awoke, hearing a noise. Both my companions were snoring,
I thought it was that and was on the point of turning
in again having seen that it was only 4.30, when I heard
the noise again. I thought&mdash;'my pony is at the oats!' and
went out.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot describe either the scene or my feelings. I
must leave those to your imagination. We were in the
middle of a floating pack of broken-up ice. The tops of the
hills were visible, but all below was thin mist and as far as
the eye could see there was nothing solid; it was all broken
up, and heaving up and down with the swell. Long black
tongues of water were everywhere. The floe on which we
were had split right under our picketing line, and cut poor
Guts' wall in half. Guts himself had gone, and a dark
streak of water alone showed the place where the ice had
opened under him. The two sledges securing the other
end of the line were on the next floe and had been pulled
right to the edge. Our camp was on a floe not more than
30 yards across. I shouted to Cherry and Crean, and
rushed out in my socks to save the two sledges; the two
floes were touching farther on and I dragged them to this
place and got them on to our floe. At that moment our own
floe split in two, but we were all together on one piece. I
then got my finnesko on, remarking that we had been in
a few tight places, but this was about the limit. I have been
told since that I was quixotic not to leave everything and
make for safety. You will understand, however, that I
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>never for one moment considered the abandonment of anything.</p>

<p>&quot;We packed up camp and harnessed up our ponies in
remarkably quick time. When ready to move I had to
decide which way to go. Obviously towards Cape Armitage
was impossible, and to the eastward also, as the wind
was from that direction, and we were already floating west
towards the open sound. Our only hope lay to the south,
and thither I went. We found the ponies would jump the
intervals well. At least Punch would and the other two
would follow him. My idea was never to separate, but to
get everything on to one floe at a time; and then wait till it
touched or nearly touched another in the right direction,
and then jump the ponies over and drag the four sledges
across ourselves. In this way we made slow, but sure progress.
While one was acting all was well, the waiting for a
lead to close was the worst trial. Sometimes it would take
10 minutes or more, but there was so much motion in the
ice that sooner or later bump you would go against another
piece, and then it was up and over. Sometimes they split,
sometimes they bounced back so quickly that only one
horse could get over, and then we had to wait again. We
had to make frequent detours and were moving west all
the time with the pack, still we were getting south, too.</p>

<p>&quot;Very little was said. Crean like most bluejackets behaved
as if he had done this sort of thing often before.
Cherry, the practical, after an hour or two dug out some
chocolate and biscuit, during one of our enforced waits,
and distributed it. I felt at that time that food was the last
thing on earth I wanted, and put it in my pocket; in less
than half an hour, though, I had eaten the lot. The ponies
behaved as well as my companions, and jumped the floes in
great style. After getting them on a new floe we simply
left them, and there they stood chewing at each others' head
ropes or harness till we were over with the sledges and
ready to take them on again. Their implicit trust in us was
touching to behold. A 12-feet sledge makes an excellent
bridge if an opening is too wide to jump. After some hours
we saw fast ice ahead, and thanked God for it. Meanwhile
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>a further unpleasantness occurred in the arrival of a host of
the terrible 'killer' whales. These were reaping a harvest
of seal in the broken-up ice, and cruised among the floes
with their immense black fins sticking up, and blowing with
a terrific roar. The Killer is scientifically known as the
Orca, and, though far smaller than the sperm and other
large whales, is a much more dangerous animal. He is
armed with a huge iron jaw and great blunt socket teeth.
Killers act in concert, too, and, as you may remember,
nearly got Ponting when we were unloading the ship, by
pressing up the thin ice from beneath and splitting it in all
directions.</p>

<p>&quot;It took us over six hours to get close to the fast ice,
which proved to be the Barrier, some immense chunks of
which we actually saw break off and join the pack. Close
in, the motion was less owing to the jambing up of the ice
somewhere farther west. We had only just cleared the
Strait in time though, as all the ice in the centre, released
beyond Cape Armitage, headed off into the middle of the
Strait, and thence to the Ross Sea. Our spirits rose as
we neared the Barrier edge, and I made for a big sloping
floe which I expected would be touching; at any rate I
anticipated no difficulty. We rushed up the slope towards
safety, and were little prepared for the scene that met our
eyes at the top. All along the Barrier face a broad lane of
water from thirty to forty feet wide extended. This was
filled with smashed-up brash ice, which was heaving up and
down to the swell like the contents of a cauldron. Killers
were cruising there with fiendish activity, and the Barrier
edge was a sheer cliff of ice on the other side fifteen to
twenty feet high. It was a case of so near and yet so far.
Suddenly our great sloping floe calved in two, so we beat
a hasty retreat. I selected a sound-looking floe just clear
of this turmoil, that was at least ten feet thick, and fairly
rounded, with a flat surface. Here we collected everything
and having done all that man could do, we fed the beasts
and took counsel.</p>

<p>&quot;Cherry and Crean both volunteered to do anything,
in the spirit they had shown right through. It appeared
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>of first necessity to communicate with Captain Scott. I
guessed his anxiety on our behalf, and, as we could do
nothing more, we wanted help of some sort. It occurred to
me that a man working up to windward along the Barrier
face might happen upon a floe touching [the Barrier]. It
was obviously impossible to take ponies up there anywhere,
but an active man might wait his opportunity. Going to
windward, too, he could always retreat on to our floe, as the
ice was being pushed together in our direction. The next
consideration was, whom to send. To go myself was out
of the question. The problem was whether to send one,
or both, my companions. As my object was to save the
animals and gear, it appeared to me that one man remaining
would be helpless in the event of the floe splitting up, as he
would be busy saving himself. I therefore decided to send
one only. This would have to be Crean, as Cherry, who
wears glasses, could not see so well. Both volunteered, but
as I say, I thought out all the pros and cons and sent Crean,
knowing that, at the worst, he could get back to us at any
time. I sent a note to Captain Scott, and, stuffing Crean's
pockets with food, we saw him depart.</p>

<p>&quot;Practical Cherry suggested pitching the tent as a
mark of our whereabouts, and having done this I mounted
the theodolite to watch Crean through the telescope. The
rise and fall of the floe made this difficult, especially as a
number of Emperor penguins came up and looked just
like men in the distance. Fortunately the sunlight cleared
the frost smoke, and as it fell calm our westerly motion
began to decrease. The swell started to go down. Outside
us in the centre of the Strait all the ice had gone out, and
open water remained. We were one of a line of loose floes
floating near the Barrier edge. Crean was hours moving to
and fro before I had the satisfaction of seeing him up on
the Barrier. I said: 'Thank God one of us is out of the
wood, anyhow.'</p>

<p>&quot;It was not a pleasant day that Cherry and I spent all
alone there, knowing as we did that it only wanted a zephyr
from the south to send us irretrievably out to sea; still
there is satisfaction in knowing that one has done one's
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>utmost, and I felt that having been delivered so wonderfully
so far, the same Hand would not forsake us at the last.</p>

<p>&quot;We gave the ponies all they could eat that day. The
Killers were too interested in us to be pleasant. They had
a habit of bobbing up and down perpendicularly, so as
to see over the edge of a floe, in looking for seals. The
huge black and yellow heads with sickening pig eyes only
a few yards from us at times, and always around us, are
among the most disconcerting recollections I have of that
day. The immense fins were bad enough, but when they
started a perpendicular dodge they were positively beastly.
As the day wore on skua gulls, looking upon us as certain
carrion, settled down comfortably near us to await developments.
The swell, however, was getting less and less and it
resolved itself into a question of speed, as to whether the
wind or Captain Scott would reach us first.</p>

<p>&quot;Crean had got up into the Barrier at great risks to himself
as I gathered afterwards from his very modest account.
He had reached Captain Scott some time after his [Scott's]
meeting with Wilson.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> I heard that at the time Captain
Scott was very angry with me for not abandoning everything
and getting away safely myself. For my own part I
must say that the abandoning of the ponies was the one
thing that had never entered my head. It was a long way
round, but at 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> he arrived at the edge of the Barrier
opposite us with Oates and Crean. Everything was still,
and Cherry and I could have got on safe ice at any time
during the last half hour by using the sledge as a ladder.
A big overturned fragment had jambed in the lane, between
a high floe and the Barrier edge, and, there being
no wind, it remained there. However, there was the consideration
of the ponies, so we waited.</p>

<p>&quot;Scott, instead of blowing me up, was too relieved at
our safety to be anything but pleased. I said: 'What
about the ponies and the sledges?' He said: 'I don't
care a damn about the ponies and sledges. It's you I want,
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>and I am going to see you safe here up on the Barrier
before I do anything else.' Cherry and I had got everything
ready, so, dragging up two sledges, we dumped the
gear off them, and using them as ladders, one down from
the berg on to the buffer piece of ice, and the other up to
the top of the Barrier, we got up without difficulty. Captain
Scott was so pleased, that I realized the feeling he must
have had all day. He had been blaming himself for our
deaths, and here we were very much alive. He said: 'My
dear chaps, you can't think how glad I am to see you safe&mdash;Cherry
likewise.'</p>

<p>&quot;I was all for saving the beasts and sledges, however,
so he let us go back and haul the sledges on to the nearest
floe. We did this one by one and brought the ponies along,
while Titus dug down a slope from the Barrier edge in the
hope of getting the ponies up it. Scott knew more about
ice than any of us, and realizing the danger we didn't, still
wanted to abandon things. I fought for my point tooth
and nail, and got him to concede one article and then
another, and still the ice did not move till we had thrown
and hauled up every article on to the Barrier except the two
ladders and the ponies.</p>

<hr />

<p>&quot;To my intense disappointment at this juncture the ice
started to move again. Titus had been digging down a
road in the Barrier edge, and I hoped to dig down a similar
slope from the floe, the snow thus shovelled down would
go over the blue ice chunk, cover up the slippery ice and
level it up. It would have taken hours, but was the only
chance of getting the animals up. We dug like fury until
Captain Scott peremptorily ordered us up. I ran up on the
floe and took the nosebags off the ponies before we got on
to the Barrier, and hauled the sledges up. It was only just
in time. There was the faintest south-easterly air, but, like
a black snake, the lane of water stretched between the
ponies and ourselves. It widened almost imperceptibly,
2 feet, 6 feet, 10 feet, 20 feet, and, sick as we were about the
ponies, we were glad to be on the safe side of that.</p>

<p>&quot;We dragged the sledges in a little way, and, leaving
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>them, pitched the two tents half a mile farther in, for bits
of the Barrier were continually calving. While supper (it
was about 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>) was being cooked, Scott and I walked
down again. The wind had gone to the east, and all the
ice was under weigh. A lane 70 feet wide extended along
the Barrier edge, and Killers were chasing up and down it
like racehorses. Our three unfortunate beasts were some
way out, sailing parallel to the Barrier. We returned, and
if ever one could feel miserable I did then. My feelings
were nothing to what poor Captain Scott had had to endure
that day. I at once broached the hopeful side of the
subject, remarking that, with the two Campbell had left,
we had ten ponies at Winter quarters. He said, however,
that he had no confidence whatever in the motors
after the way their rollers had become messed up unloading
the ship. He had had his confidence in the dogs much
shaken on the return journey, and now he had lost the most
solid asset&mdash;the best of his pony transport. He said: 'Of
course we shall have a run for our money next season, but
as far as the Pole is concerned I have but very little hope.'
We had a mournful meal, but after the others turned in I
went down again, and by striking across diagonally came
abreast of the ponies' floe, over a mile away. They were
moving west fast, but they saw me, and remained huddled
together not the least disturbed, or doubting that we would
bring them their breakfast nosebags as usual in the morning.
Poor trustful creatures! If I could have done it then,
I would gladly have killed them rather than picture them
starving on that floe out on the Ross Sea, or eaten by the
exultant Killers that cruised around.</p>

<p>&quot;After breakfast Captain Scott sent me to bring up the
sledges. It was dead calm again. Hope always springs, so
I took his pair of glasses and looked west from the Barrier
edge. Nearly all the ice had gone, but a medley of floes
had been hurled up against a long point of Barrier much
farther west. To my delight I saw three green specks on
one of these&mdash;the pony rugs&mdash;and all four of us legged it
back to the tent to tell Captain Scott. We were soon off
over the Barrier. It was a long way, but we had a tent and
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>some food. Crean had a bad day of snow-blindness, and
could see absolutely nothing. So, on arrival at the place,
we pitched the tent and left him there. The ponies were in
a much worse place than the day before, but the ice was
still there, and some floes actually touched the Barrier.</p>

<p>&quot;After our recent experience Captain Scott would only
let us go on condition that as soon as he gave the order we
were to drop everything and run for the Barrier. I was in a
feverish hurry, and with Titus and Cherry selected a possible
route over about six floes, and some low brash ice.
The hardest jump was the first one, but it was nothing to
what they had done the day before, so we put Punch at it.
Why he hung fire I cannot think,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> but he did, at the very
edge, and the next moment was in the water. I will draw
a veil over our struggle to get the plucky little pony out.
We could not manage it, and Titus had at last to put an
end to his struggles with a pick.</p>

<p>&quot;There was now my pony and Nobby. We abandoned
that route, while Captain Scott looked out another and
longer one by going right out on the sea-floes. This we
decided on, if we could get the animals off their present
floe, which necessitated a good jump on any side. Captain
Scott said he would have no repetition of Punch's misfortune
if he could help it. He would rather kill them on
the floe. Anyhow, we rushed old Nobby at the jump, but
he refused. It seemed no good, but I rushed him at it
again and again. Scott was for killing them [it should be
remembered that this ice, with the men on it, might drift
away from the Barrier at any moment, and then there might
be no further chance of saving the men] but I was not, and,
pretending not to hear him, I rushed the old beast again.
He cleared it beautifully, and Titus, seizing the opportunity,
ran my pony at it with similar success. We then
returned to the Barrier and worked along westward till a
suitable place for getting up was found. There Scott and
Cherry started digging a road, while Titus and I went out
via the sea-ice to get the ponies. We had an empty sledge
as a bridge or ladder, in case of emergency, and had to
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>negotiate about forty floes to reach the animals. It was
pretty easy going, though, and we brought them along with
great success as far as the two nearest floes. At this place
the ice was jambed.</p>

<p>&quot;Nobby cleared the last jump splendidly, when suddenly
in the open water pond on one side a school of over
a dozen of the terrible whales arose. This must have
flurried my horse just as he was jumping, as instead of
going straight he jumped [sideways] and just missed the
floe with his hind legs. It was another horrible situation,
but Scott rushed Nobby up on the Barrier, while Titus,
Cherry and I struggled with poor old Uncle Bill. Why
the whales did not come under the ice and attack him I
cannot say&mdash;perhaps they were full of seal, perhaps they
were so engaged in looking at us on the top of the floe that
they forgot to look below; anyhow, we got him safely as
far as [the bottom of the Barrier cliff], pulling him through
the thin ice towards a low patch of brash.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain Scott was afraid of something happening to us
with those devilish whales so close, and was for abandoning
the horse right away. I had no eyes or ears for anything
but the horse just then, and getting on to the thin brash
ice got the Alpine rope fast to each of the pony's forefeet.
Crean was too blind to do anything but hold the rescued
horse on the Barrier, but the other four of us pulled might
and main till we got the old horse out and lying on his side.
The brash ice was so thin that, had a 'Killer' come up then
he would have scattered it, and the lot of us into the water
like chaff. I was sick with disappointment when I found
that my horse could not rise. Titus said: 'He's done; we
shall never get him up alive.' The cold water and shock
on top of all his recent troubles, had been too much for
the undefeated old sportsman. In vain I tried to get him to
his feet; three times he tried and then fell over backwards
into the water again. At that moment a new danger arose.
The whole piece of Barrier itself started to subside.</p>

<p>&quot;It had evidently been broken before, and the tide was
doing the rest. We were ordered up and it certainly was
all too necessary; still Titus and I hung over the old Uncle<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>
Bill's head. I said: 'I can't leave him to be eaten alive
by those whales.' There was a pick lying up on the floe.
Titus said: 'I shall be sick if I have to kill another horse
like I did the last.' I had no intention that anybody should
kill my own horse but myself, and getting the pick I struck
where Titus told me. I made sure of my job before we
ran up and jumped the opening in the Barrier, carrying a
blood-stained pick-axe instead of leading the pony I had
almost considered safe.</p>

<p>&quot;We returned to our old camp that night (March 2)
with Nobby, the only one saved of the five that left One
Ton Dep&ocirc;t. I was fearfully cut up about my pony and
Punch, but it was better than last night; we knew they
would not have to starve and that all their troubles were
now at an end. Before supper I went for a walk along the
Barrier with Scott, and the next day we started back. We
left one tent, two sledges and a lot of gear as Nobby could
only pull two light sledges, and we could not pull an excessive
weight on that bad surface. As it was we had over 800 lbs.
on the sledge when we left. It was a glaring day with the
surface soft and sandy, a combination of unpleasant circumstances.
It took five hours to drag as far as the place
we had originally gone down on to the sea-ice from the
Barrier.</p>

<p>&quot;Evans and his party should now have arrived from
Corner Camp, and as Captain Scott wanted to see if they
had left a note at Safety Camp, I walked up there while the
tea was being brewed. It was about 1&frac14; miles away, and I
found traces of the party in the snow, but no note. It fed
me up to see the walls so recently occupied by our ponies,
and I was glad to leave. The afternoon march was interminable;
it seemed as if we would never reach the coast.
At last we came to the Pram Point Pressure Ridges where
the Barrier joins the peninsula to eastward of Cape Armitage.
They are waves of ice up to 20 feet in height running
along parallel to each other with a valley in between each,
and are only crevassed badly at the outer end as far as we
have seen, though there are smaller crevasses right along.
We camped in one of these valleys about 9.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>; I was
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>thoroughly tired, so I think was everybody else. We were
about a mile from the ice edge; and the problem was where
to get Nobby up the precipitous slopes. This was solved
by the arrival of Evans, Atkinson, Forde and Keohane
about midnight. They had seen us coming in from the
heights, and had come down for news. Teddy Evans had
arrived the day before, and, being warned off the Barrier
edge by a note left by Captain Scott, had made for the land
with his party, and one horse Jimmy Pigg. He had found
a good way up a mile or so farther east, almost under Castle
Rock. He had walked to Hut Point with Atkinson the
next day and heard of the loss of Cherry, myself and the
animals from Bill Wilson and Meares who had been left
there to look after their teams. I hadn't seen Atkinson for
quite a while when we met this time.</p>

<p>&quot;The next day we relayed the sledges up the slope
which was about 700 feet high rising from a small bay. It
was so steep that the pony could only be led up and we
had to put on crampons to grip the ice. These are merely
a sole of leather with light metal plates for foot and heel
containing spikes. [These were altered afterwards.] They
have leather beckets and a lanyard rove off for making
them fast over the finnesko. It took us all the morning to
get everything up to the top and then it started to blow.
The camp was wonderfully sheltered. Jimmy Pigg and
Nobby were reunited after many weeks, and to show their
friendliness the former bit the latter in the back of the neck
as a first introduction. Atkinson had gone to Hut Point to
reassure Uncle Bill as to our safety and arrived again with
Gran just as we got the last load up. There was no sugar at
the hut except what the dogs had brought in, so Gran, who
was quite fresh, volunteered to get a couple of bags from
the dep&ocirc;t at Safety Camp, which could plainly be seen out
on the Barrier. We all went to the edge of the slope to see
him go down it on ski. He did it splendidly and must
have been going with the speed of an express train down
the incline, as he was on the Barrier in an incredibly short
time compared to the hours we had dragged up the same
slope with the loads. Teddy, Titus and Keohane were left
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>at the camp to be joined by Gran later. Scott started off for
Hut Point with Crean and Cherry on his sledge, while I
followed with Forde and Atkinson. The others helped us up
several hundred feet of slope and left us under Castle Rock.</p>

<p>&quot;It was here that they mistook their way in the blizzard
and lost a man from the Discovery. Though it was fine
below it was blowing like anything on the heights. I was
too busily occupied to see much of the hills and snow-slopes
which I got to know so well later. It was about three miles
direct to the hut, but very up and down hill. At the last,
however, you see the Bay in panorama with Cape Armitage
on one side, and Hut Point on the other, where the Discovery
lay two whole years. It is a magnificent view
from the heights and for wild desolate grandeur would
take some beating; the Western Mountains and the great
dome of Mount Discovery across the black strait of water,
covered with dark frost smoke, and here and there an iceberg
driving fast towards the sea. About half a mile below
us was the little hut and, on the left, the 800-feet pyramid
of Observation Hill. It is a perfect chaos of hills and extinct
craters just here.</p>

<p>&quot;It was blowing like fun. We left one sledge on the
top of ski-slope and just took what was necessary on the
other, such as our bags, etc. It was my first experience of
steep downhill sledging. Instead of anybody pulling forward
we all had to hang back and guide the sledge down
the slippery incline without letting it take charge or getting
upset. It is great fun. On reaching the head of the Bay,
however, we had quite a dangerous little bit to cross. Here
it was swept of snow and there was nothing but glassy ice
and the incline ended in a low ice-cliff with the water below
it. Attached as we were to the sledge we should have been
at a disadvantage had it come to swimming, which a slip
might easily have brought about. We scratched carefully
across this and then headed down on the snow, arriving at
the hut all well. The old hut had changed tremendously
since I last saw it, having been dug out and cleared of
snow and ice. Two unrecognizable sweeps greeted us
heartily, they were Bill and Meares; the dogs howled a
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>chorus for our benefit; it was quite like coming home.
Inside the hut, the cause of the blackness was apparent,
they had a blubber fire going, an open one, with no chimney
or uptake for the smoke. After such a long open-air
life it fairly choked me, and for once I could not eat a
square meal. We all slept in a row against the west wall of
the hut with our feet inboard.</p>

<p>&quot;The next morning Captain Scott, Bill, Cherry and I set
out to walk to Castle Rock and meet the other party. It
was fairly fizzing from the sea, but clear. Once up on the
Heights, however, we seemed to get less wind. A couple
of hours later we were at the great rock, Castle Rock,
which is one of the best landmarks about here. The party
in the Saddle Camp had relayed two of the sledges up the
slope; these we hauled on to the top while the two ponies
were harnessed and brought up. There were three sledges
left to take on altogether, so the ponies took one each and
we the other. Meanwhile Captain Scott walked over the
shoulder under Castle Rock to see down the Strait and came
back with the intelligence that he could hardly believe his
eyes, but half the Glacier Tongue had broken off and disappeared.
This great Tongue of ice had stood there on
arrival of the Discovery, ten years before, and had remained
ever since; it had a dep&ocirc;t of Shackleton's on it, and Campbell
had dep&ocirc;ted his fodder on it for us. On the eventful
night of the break-up of the ice at least three miles of the
Tongue which had been considered practically terra firma
had gone, after having been there probably for centuries.
We headed for the hut: Bill had looked out a route for
the ponies, to avoid slippery places. It started to bliz, but
was not too thick for us to see our bearings. At the top of
Ski Slope the ponies were taken out of the sledges and led
down a circuitous route over the rocks. The rest of us put
everything we wanted on one sledge and leaving the others
up there went down the slope as before. The two ponies
arrived before us and were stabled in the verandah.</p>

<p>&quot;That night for the first time since the establishment
of Safety Camp the dep&ocirc;t party were all together again,
minus six ponies. In concluding my report to Captain<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>
Scott on the 'floe' incident, which he asked me to set down
long afterwards, I said, 'In reconsidering the foregoing I
have come to the conclusion that I underestimated the
danger signs on the sea-ice on February 28, and on the
following day might have attached more importance to the
safety of my companions. As it was, however, all circumstances
seemed to conspire together to make the situation
unavoidable.' I did not forget to mention the splendid behaviour
of Cherry and Crean, and, for my own part, I have
no regrets. I took the blame for my lack of experience, but
knew that having done everything I could do, it did not
concern me if anybody liked to criticize my action. My
own opinion is that it just had to be, the circumstances
leading to it were too devious for mere coincidence. Six
hours earlier we could have walked to the hut on sound
sea-ice. A few hours later we should have seen open water
on arrival at the Barrier edge. The blizzard that knocked
out the beasts, the death of Weary, the misunderstanding
of the dogs, everything, fitted in to place us on the sea-ice
during the only two hours of the whole year that we could
possibly have been in such a position. Let those who believe
in coincidence carry on believing. Nobody will ever
convince me that there was not something more. Perhaps
in the light of next year we shall see what was meant by
such an apparent blow to our hopes. Certainly we shall
start for the Pole with less of that foolish spirit of blatant
boast and ridiculous blind self-assurance, that characterized
some of us on leaving Cardiff.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor Captain Scott had now a new anxiety thrust
upon him. The Winter Station with ponies, stores and
motors was all situated on a low beach not twenty yards
from the water's edge, and now that the ice had gone out
(and the hut was not six feet above sea-level at the floor)
how had they fared in the storm? This was a problem we
could not solve without going to see. Cape Evans, though
dimly in sight, was as far off as New Zealand till the sea
froze over. The idea of attempting the shoulder of Erebus
did occur to Captain Scott, but it was so heavily crevassed
as to make a journey from our side almost impossible.<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>
On the other side Professor David's party got up to the
Summit without finding a crevasse. Captain Scott took
his reverses like a brick. I often went out for a walk with
him and sometimes he discussed his plans for next season.
He took his losses very philosophically and never blamed
any of us.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p>This is the end of that part of Bowers' letter which
deals with the incident. Crean told me afterwards how he
got on to the Barrier. He first made for the Gap, following
the best path of the ice, but then had to retrace his
steps and make for White Island jumping from floe to floe.
But then &quot;I was pretty lively,&quot; said he: and &quot;there were
lots of penguins and seals and killers knocking round that
day.&quot;</p>

<p>Crean had one of the ski sticks and that &quot;was a great
help to me for getting over the floes. It was a sloping piece
like what you were on and it was very near touching the
Barrier, in one corner of it only. Well, I dug a hole with
the ski stick in the side of the Barrier for a step for one foot,
and when I finished the hole I straddled my legs and got
one on the floe and one in the side of the Barrier. Then I
got the stick and dug it in on top and I gave myself a bit of
a spring and got my outside leg up top. It was a terrible
place but I thought it was the only chance.</p>

<p>&quot;I made straight for Safety Camp and they must have
spotted me: for I think it was Gran that met me on skis.
Then Scott and Wilson and Oates met me a long way out:
I explained how it happened. He was worried-looking a
bit, but he never said anything out of the way. He told
Oates to go inside and light the primus and give me a
meal.&quot;</p>

<p>A more detailed account of the behaviour of the hundreds
of whales which infested the lanes of open water
between the broken floes and calved bergs is of interest.
Most of them at any rate were Killer whales (Orca
gladiator), and they were cruising about in great numbers,
snorting and blowing, while occasionally they would
in some extraordinary way raise themselves and look about
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>over the ice, resting the fore part of their enormous yellow
and black bodies on the edge of the floes. They were undisguisedly
interested in us and the ponies, and we felt that if
we once got into the water our ends would be swift and
bloody.</p>

<p>But I have a very distinct recollection that the whales
were not all Killers, and that some, at any rate, were Bottle-nosed
whales. This was impressed upon me by one of the
most dramatic moments of that night and day.</p>

<p>We made our way very slowly, sometimes waiting
twenty minutes for the floe on which we were to touch the
next one in the direction we were trying to go, but before
us in the distance was a region of sea-ice which appeared
to slope gradually up on to the fast Barrier beyond. As we
got nearer we saw a dark line appear at intervals between
the two. This we considered was a crevasse at the edge of
the Barrier which was opening and shutting with the very
big swell which was running, and on which all the floes
were bobbing up and down. We told one another that we
could rush the ponies over this as it closed.</p>

<p>We approached the Barrier and began to rise up on the
sloping floes which had edged the Barrier and so on to
small bergs which had calved from the Barrier itself.
Leaving Crean with the ponies, Bowers and I went forward
to prospect, and rose on to a berg from which we hoped to
reach the Barrier.</p>

<p>I can never forget the scene that met us. Between us
and the Barrier was a lane of some fifty yards wide, a seething
cauldron. Bergs were calving off as we watched: and
capsizing: and hitting other bergs, splitting into two and
falling apart. The Killers filled the whole place. Looking
downwards into a hole between our berg and the next, a
hole not bigger than a small room, we saw at least six
whales. They were so crowded that they could only lie so
as to get their snouts out of the water, and my memory is
that their snouts were bottle-nosed. At this moment our
berg split into two parts and we hastily retreated to the
lower and safer floes.</p>

<p>Now in the Zoological Report of the Discovery Ex<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>pedition
Wilson states that the true identity of the Bottle-nosed
whale (Hyperoodon rostrata) in Antarctic Seas has
not been conclusively established. But that inasmuch as it
certainly frequents seas so far as 48&deg; S. latitude it is probable
that certain whales which he and other members of
that expedition saw frequenting the edge of the ice were,
as they appeared to be, Bottle-nosed whales. For my part,
without great knowledge of whales, I am convinced that
these whales which lay but twenty feet below us were whales
of this species.</p>

<p>After our rescue by Scott we pitched our tents, as has
been described, at least half a mile from the fast edge of
the Barrier. All night long, or as it really was, early morning,
the Killers were snorting and blowing under the
Barrier, and sometimes, it seemed, under our tents. Time
and again some member of the party went out of the tent to
see if the Barrier had not broken farther back, but there
was no visible change, and it must have been that the apparently
solid ice on which we were, was split up by crevasses
by the big swell which had been running, and that round
us, hidden by snow bridges, were leads of water in which
whales were cruising in search of seal.</p>

<p>The next day most of the ice had gone out to sea, and
I do not think the whales were so numerous. The most
noticeable thing about them that day was the organization
shown by the band of whales which appeared after Bowers'
pony, Uncle Bill, had fallen between two floes, and we
were trying to get him towards the Barrier. &quot;Good God,
look at the whales,&quot; said some one, and there, in a pool
of water behind the floe on which we were working, lay
twelve great whales in perfect line, facing the floe. And
out in front of them, like the captain of a company of
soldiers, was another. As we turned they dived as one
whale, led by the big fellow in front, and we certainly expected
that they would attack the floe on which we stood.
Whether they never did so, or whether they tried and
failed, for the floes here were fifteen or sixteen feet thick, I
do not know; we never saw them again.</p>

<p>One other incident of those days is worth recalling.<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>
&quot;Cherry, Crean, we're floating out to sea,&quot; was the startling
awakening from Bowers, standing in his socks outside
the tent at 4.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> that Wednesday morning. And indeed
at first sight on getting outside the tent it looked a
quite hopeless situation. I thought it was madness to try
and save the ponies and gear when, it seemed, the only
chance at all of saving the men was an immediate rush for
the Barrier, and I said so. &quot;Well, I'm going to try,&quot; was
Bowers' answer, and, quixotic or no, he largely succeeded.
I never knew a man who treated difficulties with such scorn.</p>

<hr />

<p>There must be some of my companions who look back
upon Hut Point with a peculiar fondness, such as men get
for places where they have experienced great joys and great
trials. And Hut Point has an atmosphere of its own. I do
not know what it is. Partly aesthetic, for the sea and great
mountains, and the glorious colour effects which prevail in
spring and autumn, would fascinate the least imaginative;
partly mysterious, with the Great Barrier knocking at your
door, and the smoke of Erebus by day and the curtain of
Aurora by night; partly the associations of the place&mdash;the
old hut, the old landmarks, so familiar to those who know
the history of the Discovery Expedition, the stakes in the
snow, the holes for which ice was dug to water the ship,
Vince's Cross on the Point. Now there is another Cross,
on Observation Hill.</p>

<p>And yet when we first arrived the hut was comfortless
enough. Wilson and Meares and Gran had been there
some days; they had found some old bricks and a grid,
and there was an open blubber fire in the middle of the
floor. There was no outlet for the smoke and smuts and it
was impossible to see your neighbour, to speak without
coughing, or to open your eyes long before they began to
smart. Atkinson and Crean had cleared the floor of ice
in our absence, but the space between the lower and
upper roofs was solid with blue ice, and the lower roof
sagged down in places in a dangerous way. The wind
howled continuously and to say that the hut was cold is a
very mild expression of the reality.<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></p>

<p>This hut was built by the Discovery Expedition, who
themselves lived in the ship which lay off the shore frozen
into the sea-ice, as a workroom and as a refuge in case of
shipwreck. It was useful to them in some ways, but was
too large to heat with the amount of coal available, and
was rather a white elephant. Scott wrote of it that &quot;on the
whole our large hut has been and will be of use to us, but
its uses are never likely to be of such importance as to
render it indispensable, nor cause it to be said that circumstances
have justified the outlay made on it, or the expenditure
of space and trouble in bringing it to its final home.
It is here now, however, and here it will stand for many a
long year with such supplies as will afford the necessaries
of life to any less fortunate party who may follow in our
footsteps and be forced to search for food and shelter.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Well! It was to be more useful to Scott in 1910 to
1913 than he imagined in 1902. We found the place with
its verandah complete, the remains of the two magnetic
huts and a rubbish heap. It was wonderful what that rubbish
heap yielded up. Bricks to build a blubber stove, a
sheet of iron to put over the top of it, a length of stove
piping to form a chimney. Somehow somebody made
cement, and built the bricks together, and one of the
magnetic huts gave up its asbestos sheeting to insulate the
chimney from the woodwork of the roofs. An old door
made a cook's table, old cases turned upside down made
seats. The provisions left by the Discovery were biscuits
contained in some forty large packing cases. These we piled
up across the middle of our house as a bulkhead and the
old Discovery winter awning was dug out of the snow outside
and fixed against the wall thus made to keep the warmth in.
At night we cleared the floor space and spread our bags.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-18.jpg"><img src="./images/1-18_th.jpg" alt="Hut Point From Observation Hill" title="Hut Point From Observation Hill" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Hut Point From Observation Hill</span></p>
<hr />


<p>The two precious survivors of the eight ponies with
which we started on our journey were housed in the verandah,
which was made wind-proof and snow-proof.
The more truculent dogs lay tethered outside, the more
docile were allowed their freedom, but even so the dog
fights were not infrequent. We had one poor little dog,<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>
Makaka by name. When unloading the ship this dog
had been overrun by the sledge which he was helping
to pull; he suffered again when the team of dogs fell
down the crevasse, and was now partially paralysed. He
was a wretched object, for the hair refused to grow on his
hind quarters, but he was a real sportsman and had no
idea of giving in. Meares and I went out one night when
it was blowing hard, attracted by the cries of a dog. It was
Makaka who had ventured to climb a steep slope and was
now afraid to return. When the dogs finally returned to
Cape Evans, Makaka was allowed to run by the side of the
team; but when Cape Evans was reached he was gone.
Search failed to find him and, after some weeks, hope of
him was abandoned. But a month afterwards Gran and
Debenham went over to Hut Point, and here at the
entrance of the hut they found Makaka, pitifully weak
but able to bark to them. He must have lived on seal, but
how he did so in that condition is a mystery.</p>

<p>The reader may ask how it was that being so near our
Winter Quarters at Cape Evans we were unable to reach
them immediately. Cape Evans is fifteen miles across the
sea from Hut Point, and though both huts are on the same
island&mdash;Hut Point being at the end of a peninsula and
Cape Evans on the remains of a flow of lava which juts out
into the sea&mdash;the land which joins the two has never yet
been crossed by a sledge party owing to the great ice falls
which cover the slopes of Erebus. A glance at the map
will show that although Hut Point is surrounded with sea,
or sea-ice, on every side except that of Arrival Heights, the
Barrier abuts upon the Hut Point Peninsula to the south
beyond Pram Point. Thus there is always communication
with the Barrier by a devious route by which indeed we had
just arrived, but farther progress north is cut off until the
cold temperature of the autumn and winter causes the
open sea to freeze. We arrived at Hut Point on March 5
and Scott expected to be able to cross on the newly-frozen
ice by about March 21. However, it was nearly a month
after that when the first party could pass to Cape Evans,
and then only the Bays were frozen and the Sound was
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>still open water, owing to the winds which swept the ice
out to sea almost as soon as it was formed.</p>

<p>On the top of all the anxieties which had oppressed him
lately Scott had a great fear that a swell so phenomenal as
to break up Glacier Tongue, a landmark which had probably
been there for centuries, might have swept away our
hut at Cape Evans. He was so alarmed about it that
he told Wilson and myself to prepare to form a sledging
party with him to penetrate the Erebus icefalls and
reach Cape Evans. &quot;Went yesterday to Castle Rock with
Wilson to see what chance there might be of getting to
Cape Evans. The day was bright and it was quite warm
walking in the sun. There is no doubt the route to Cape
Evans lies over the worst corner of Erebus. From this
distance (some 7 or 8 miles at least) the whole mountain
side looks a mass of crevasses, but a route might be found
at a level of 3000 or 4000 feet.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> After some days the
project was abandoned as being hopeless.</p>

<p>On March 8 Bowers led a party to bring in the gear and
provisions which had been left at Disaster Camp, the
material, that is, which had been rescued from the sea-ice.
They were away three days and found the pulling very
hard. &quot;At the corner of the bay the Barrier was buckled
into round ridges which took a couple of hours to cross.
We marched for some time alongside an enormous crevasse,
which lay like a street near us. I examined it at
one point which must have been 15 feet wide, and though
it was impossible to see the bottom for snow cornices
it was undoubtedly open as I could hear a seal blowing
below.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Bowers' letter describes them dragging their heavy load
up the slope to Castle Rock: &quot;It took us all the morning to
reach Saddle Camp with the loads in two journeys. I found
a steady plod up a steep hill without spells is better and
less exhausting than a rush and a number of rests. This
theory I put into practice with great success. I don't know
whether everybody saw eye to eye with me over the idea
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>of getting to the top without a spell. After the second
sledge was up Atkinson said: 'I don't mind you as a rule,
but there are times when I positively hate you.'&quot;</p>

<p>Defoe could have written another Robinson Crusoe with
Hut Point instead of San Juan Fernandez. Our sledging
supplies were mostly exhausted and we depended upon the
seals we could kill for food, fuel and light. We were smutty
as sweeps from the blubber we burned; and a more blackguard-looking
crew would have been hard to find. We
spent our fine days killing, cutting up and carrying in seal
when we could find them, or climbing the various interesting
hills and craters which abound here, and our evenings
in long discussions which seldom settled anything. Some
looked after dogs, and others after ponies; some made geological
collections; others sketched the wonderful sunsets;
but before and above all we ate and slept. We must have
spent a good twelve hours asleep in our bags every day
after our six weeks' sledging. And we rested. Perhaps this
is not everybody's notion of a very good time, but it was
good enough for us.</p>

<p>The Weddell seal which frequents the seas which fringe
the Antarctic continent was a standby for most of our
wants; for he can at a pinch provide not only meat to eat,
fuel for your fire and oil for your lamp, but also leather for
your finnesko and an antidote to scurvy. As he lies out on
the sea-ice, a great ungainly shape, nothing short of an
actual prod will persuade him to take much notice of an
Antarctic explorer. Even then he is as likely as not to
yawn in your face and go to sleep again. His instincts
are all to avoid the water when alarmed, for he knows his
enemies the killer whales live there: but if you drive him
into the water he is transformed in the twinkling of an
eye into a thing of beauty and grace, which can travel and
turn with extreme celerity and which can successfully chase
the fish on which he feeds.</p>

<p>We were lucky now in that a small bay of sea-ice, about
an acre in extent, still remained within two miles of us at
a corner where Barrier, sea, and land meet, called Pram
Point by Scott in the Discovery days.<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></p>

<p>Now Pram Point during the summer months is one of
the most populous seal nurseries in McMurdo Sound. In
this neighbourhood the Barrier, moving slowly towards the
Peninsula, buckles the sea-ice into pressure ridges. As the
trough of each ridge is forced downwards, so in summer
pools of sea water are formed in which the seal make their
holes and among these ridges they lie and bask in the sun:
the males fight their battles, the females bring forth their
young: the children play and chase their tails just like
kittens. Now that the sea-ice had broken up, many seal
were to be found in this sheltered corner under the green
and blue ice-cliffs of Crater Hill.</p>

<p>If you go seal killing you want a big stick, a bayonet,
a flensing knife and a steel. Any big stick will do, so long
as it will hit the seal a heavy blow on the nose: this stuns
him and afterwards mercifully he feels no more. The
bayonet knife (which should be fitted into a handle with a
cross-piece to prevent the slipping of the hand down on to
the blade) should be at least 14 inches long without the
handle; this is used to reach the seal's heart. Our flensing
knives were one foot long including the handle, the blades
were seven inches long by 1&frac14; inches broad: some were
pointed and others round and I do not know which was
best. The handles should be of wood as being warmer to
hold.</p>

<p>Killing and cutting up seals is a gruesome but very necessary
business, and the provision of suitable implements is
humane as well as economic in time and labour. The skin
is first cut off with the blubber attached: the meat is then
cut from the skeleton, the entrails cleaned out, the liver
carefully excised. The whole is then left to freeze in pieces
on the snow, which are afterwards collected as rock-like
lumps. The carcass can be cut up with an axe when
needed and fed to the dogs. Nothing except entrails was
wasted.</p>

<p>Lighting was literally a burning question. I do not
know that any lamp was better than a tin matchbox fed
with blubber, with strands of lamp wick sticking up in it,
but all kinds of patterns big and small were made by proud
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>inventors; they generally gave some light, though not a
brilliant one. There were more ambitious attempts than
blubber. The worst of these perhaps was produced by
Oates. Somebody found some carbide and Oates immediately
schemed to light the hut with acetylene. I think he
was the only person who did not view the preparation
with ill-concealed nervousness. However, Wilson took the
situation into his tactful hands. For several days Oates and
Wilson were deep in the acetylene plant scheme and then,
apparently without reason, it was found that it could not
be done. It was a successful piece of strategy which no
woman could have bettered.</p>

<p>Bowers, Wilson, Atkinson and I were on Crater Hill
one morning when we espied a sledge party approaching
from the direction of Castle Rock. As we expected, this
was the Geological party, consisting of Griffith Taylor,
Wright, Debenham and Seaman Evans, home from the
Western Mountains. They entirely failed to recognize in
our black faces the men whom they had last seen from
the ship at Glacier Tongue. I hope their story will be
told by Debenham. For days their doings were the topic
of conversation. Both numerically and intellectually they
were an addition to our party, which now numbered sixteen.
Taylor especially is seldom at a loss for conversation
and his remarks are generally original, if sometimes
crude. Most of us were glad to listen when the discussions
in which he was a leading figure raged round the blubber
stove. Scott and Wilson were always in the thick of it,
and the others chimed in as their interest, knowledge and
experience led. Rash statements on questions of fact were
always dangerous, for our small community contained so
many specialists that errors were soon exposed. At the
same time there were few parts of the world that one or
other of us had not visited at least once. Later, when we
came to our own limited quarters, books of reference were
constantly in demand to settle disputes. Such books as
the Times Atlas, a good encyclopaedia and even a Latin
Dictionary are invaluable to such expeditions for this purpose.
To them I would add Who's Who.<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></p>

<p>From odd corners we unearthed some Contemporary
Reviews, the Girls' Own Paper and the Family Herald,
all of ten years ago! We also found encased in ice an incomplete
copy of Stanley Weyman's My Lady Rotha; it
was carefully thawed out and read by everybody, and the
excitement was increased by the fact that the end of the
book was missing.</p>

<p>&quot;Who's going to cook?&quot; was one of the last queries
each night, and two men would volunteer. It is not great
fun lighting an ordinary coal fire on a cold winter's morning,
but lighting the blubber fire at Hut Point when the
metal frosted your fingers and the frozen blubber had to
be induced to drip was a far more arduous task. The water
was converted from its icy state and, by that time, the
stove was getting hot, in inverse proportion to your temper.
Seal liver fry and cocoa with unlimited Discovery Cabin
biscuits were the standard dish for breakfast, and when it
was ready a sustained cry of 'hoosh' brought the sleepers
from their bags, wiping reindeer hairs from their eyes. I
think I was responsible for the greatest breakfast failure
when I fried some biscuits and sardines (we only had
one tin). Leaving the biscuits in the frying pan, the lid
of a cooker, after taking it from the fire, they went on
cooking and became as charcoal. This meal was known
as 'the burnt-offering.' On April 1 Bowers prepared to
make a fool of two of us by putting chaff in our pannikins
and covering the top only with seal meat. The plan turned
back upon the maker, for he had not enough left to
make up the deficiency, and, as I found out many weeks
afterwards, surreptitiously gave up his own hoosh to the
April fools and went without himself. Of such are the
small incidents which afforded real amusement and even
live in the memory as outstanding features of our existence.</p>

<p>Breakfast done, there was a general clean-up. One
seized the apology for a broom which existed: day foot-gear,
finnesko, hair socks, ordinary socks and puttees, took
the place of fleecy sleeping-socks and fur-lined sleeping-boots:
lunch cooks began to make their preparations: ice
was fetched for water: a frozen chunk of red seal meat
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>or liver was levered and chopped with an ice axe from
the general store of seal meat: fids of sealskin, with the
blubber attached, a good three inches of it perhaps, were
brought in and placed by the stove, much as we bring in a
scuttle of coal. Gradually the community scattered as
duty or inclination led, leaving some members to dig away
the snow-drifts which had accumulated round the door and
windows during the night.</p>

<p>By lunch time every one had some new item of interest.
Wright had found a new form of ice crystal: Scott had
tested the ice off the Point and found it five inches thick:
Wilson had found new seal holes off Cape Armitage, and
we had hopes of finding our food and fuel nearer home:
Atkinson had killed an Emperor penguin which weighed
over ninety pounds, a record: and the assistant zoologist
felt he would have to skin it, and did not want to do so:
Meares had found an excellent place to roll stones down
Arrival Heights into the sea: Debenham had a new theory
to account for the Great Boulder, as a mammoth block different
in structure from the surrounding geological features
was called: Bowers had a scheme for returning from the
Pole by the Plateau instead of the Barrier: Oates might
be heard saying that he thought he could do with another
chupattie. A favourite pastime was the making of knots.
Could you make a clove hitch with one hand?</p>

<p>The afternoon was like the morning, save that the sun
was now sinking behind the Western Mountains. These
autumn effects were among the most beautiful sights of
the world, and it was now that Wilson made the sketches
for many of the water-colours which he afterwards painted
at Winter Quarters. The majority were taken from the
summit of Observation Hill, crouching under the lee of
the rocks into which, nearly two years after, we built the
Cross which now stands to commemorate his death and
that of his companions. He sketched quickly with bare
fingers and mittened hands, jotting down the outlines of
hills and clouds, and pencilling in the colours by name.
After a minute, more or less, the fingers become too cold
for such work, and they must be put back into the wool and
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>fur mitts until they are again warm enough to continue.
Pencil and sketch book, a Winsor and Newton, were carried
in a little blubber-stained wallet on his belt. Scott
carried his sledge diaries in similar books in a similar wallet
made of green Willesden canvas and fastened with a lanyard.</p>

<p>There was a good fug in the hut by dinner time: this
was a mixed blessing. It was good for our gear: sleeping-bags,
finnesko, mitts, socks were all hung up and dried,
most necessary after sledging, and most important for the
preservation of the skins; but it also started the most infernal
drip-drip from the roof. I have spoken of the double
roof of the old Discovery hut. This was still full of solid
ice; indeed some time afterwards a large portion of it fell,
but luckily the inhabitants were outside. The immediate
problem was to prevent the leaks falling on ourselves, our
food or our clothing and bags. And so every tin was
brought into use and hung from leaky spots, while water
chutes came into their own. As the stove cooled so did the
drip cease, and in no prehistoric cavern did more stalactites
and stalagmites grow apace.</p>

<p>On March 16 the last sledge party to the Barrier that
season started for Corner Camp with provisions to increase
the existing dep&ocirc;t there. The party was in charge of Lieutenant
Evans, and consisted of Bowers, Oates, Atkinson,
Wright, and myself, with two seamen, Crean and Forde.
The journey out and back took eight days and was uneventful
as sledge journeys go. Thick weather prevailed
for several days, and after running down our distance to
Corner Camp we waited for it to clear. We found ourselves
six miles from the dep&ocirc;t and among crevasses, which
goes to show how easy it is to steer off the course under
such conditions, and how creditable the navigation is when
a course is kept correctly, sometimes more by instinct than
by skill.</p>

<p>But we got our first experience of cold weather sledging
which was useful. The minus thirties and forties are not
very cold as we were to understand cold afterwards, but
quite cold enough to start with; cold enough to teach you
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>how to look after your footgear, handle metal and not to
waste time. However, the sun was still well up during the
day, and this makes all the difference, since any sun does
more drying of clothes and gear than none at all. At the
same time we began to realize the difficulties which attend
upon spring journeys, though we could only imagine what
might be the trials on a journey in mid-winter, such as we
intended to essay.</p>

<p>It is easy to be wise after the event, but, in looking
back upon the expedition as a whole, and the tragedy
which was to come, mainly from the unforeseen cold of the
autumn on the Barrier (such as minus forties in February)
it seems that we might have grasped that these temperatures
were lower than might have been expected in the
middle of March quite near the open sea. Even if this
had occurred to any one, and I do not think that it did,
I doubt whether the next step of reasoning would have
followed, namely, the possibility that the interior of the
Barrier would, as actually happened, prove to be much
colder than was expected at this date. On the contrary
I several times heard Scott mention the possibility of the
Polar Party not returning until April. At the same time
it must be realized that pony transport to the foot of
the Beardmore Glacier made a late start inevitable, for
the blizzards our ponies had already suffered proved that
spring weather on the Barrier would be intolerable to them.
As a matter of fact, Scott says in his Message to the Public,
&quot;no one in the world would have expected the temperature
and surfaces which we encountered at this time of the
year.&quot;</p>

<p>We returned to find everything at Hut Point, including
the hut, covered with frozen spray. This was the
result of a blizzard of which we only felt the tail end on
the Barrier. Scott wrote: &quot;The sea was breaking constantly
and heavily on the ice foot. The spray carried right
over the Point&mdash;covering all things and raining on the roof
of the hut. Poor Vince's cross, some 30 feet above the
water, was enveloped in it. Of course the dogs had a
very poor time, and we went and released two or three,
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>getting covered in spray during the operation&mdash;our wind
clothes very wet. This is the third gale from the South
since our arrival here (<i>i.e.</i> in 2&frac12; weeks). Any one of these
would have rendered the Bay impossible for a ship, and,
therefore, it is extraordinary that we should have entirely
escaped such a blow when the Discovery was in it in
1902.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>It is difficult to see long distances across open water at
this time of year because the comparatively warm water
throws up into the air a fog, known as frost-smoke. If
there is a wind this smoke is carried over the surface of the
sea, but if calm the smoke rises and forms a dense curtain.
Standing on Arrival Heights, which form the nail of the
finger-like Peninsula on which we now lived, we could see
the four islands which lie near Cape Evans, and a black
smudge in the face of the glaciers which descend from
Erebus, which we knew to be the face of the steep slope
above Cape Evans, afterwards named The Ramp. But,
for the present, our comfortable hut might have been
thousands of miles away for all the good it was to us. As
soon as the wind fell calm the sea was covered by a thin
layer of ice, in twenty-four hours it might be four or five
inches thick, but as yet it never proved strong enough to
resist the next blizzard. In March the ice to the south was
safe; there was appearance of ice in the two bays at the
foot of Erebus' slopes in the beginning of April.</p>

<p>We treated newly formed ice with far too little respect.
It was on April 7 that Scott asked whether any of us would
like to walk northwards over the newly formed ice towards
Castle Rock. We had walked about two miles, the ice
heaving up and down as we went, dodging the open pools
and leads to the best of our ability, when Taylor went right
in. Luckily he could lever himself out without help, and
returned to the hut with all speed. We prepared to cross
this ice to Cape Evans the next day, but the whole of it
went out in the night. On another occasion we were prepared
to set out the following morning, but the ice on
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>which we were to cross went out on the turn of the tide
some five hours before we timed ourselves to start.</p>

<p>Scott was of opinion that the ice in the two Bays under
Erebus was firm, and prepared to essay this route. The
first of these bays is formed by the junction of the Hut
Point Peninsula with Erebus to the south, and by Glacier
Tongue to the north. Crossing Glacier Tongue a party
can descend on to the second bay beyond, the northern
boundary of which is Cape Evans. The Dellbridge Islands,
of which Great Razorback is in direct line between Glacier
Tongue and Cape Evans, help to hold in any ice which
forms here. The route had never been attempted before,
but it was hoped that a way down from the Peninsula on
to the frozen sea might be found at the Hutton Cliffs, an
outcrop of lava rock in the irregular ice face.</p>

<p>&quot;A party consisting of Scott, Bowers, Taylor, and Seaman
Evans with one tent, and Lieutenant Evans, Wright,
Debenham, Gran and Crean with another, started for Hut
Point. It was dark to the south and snowing by the time
they reached the top of Ski Slope. We helped them past
Third Crater. The ice from Hut Point to Glacier Tongue
was impossible, and so they went on past Castle Rock and
were to try and get down somewhere by the Hutton Cliffs
on to some fast sea-ice which seemed to have held there some
time, and so across Glacier Tongue on to sea-ice which also
seemed to be fast as far as Cape Evans.</p>

<p>&quot;After lunch Wilson and I started about 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> in
half a blizzard. It was much better on the Heights and
fairly clear towards Erebus, but we could not see any traces
of the party on the ice.</p>

<p>&quot;April 12. This morning as it was beginning to get
light a blizzard started, and it is blowing very hard now.
The large amount of snow which has fallen will make it
very thick. We are all anxious about the returning party,
for Scott talked of camping on the sea-ice. The ice in
Arrival Bay (just north of Hut Point) has gone out. They
have sleeping-bags, food for two meals, and a full primus
for each tent.</p>

<p>&quot;April 13. We were very anxious about the returning
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>party, especially when all the ice north of Hut Point went
out. The blizzard blew itself out this morning, and it was
a great change to see White Island and The Bluff once
more. Atkinson came in before lunch and told me that,
looking from the Heights, the ice from Glacier Tongue to
Cape Evans appeared to have gone out. This sobered our
lunch. We all made our way to Second Crater afterwards,
and found the ice from the Hutton Cliffs to Glacier Tongue
and thence to Cape Evans was still in.</p>

<p>&quot;Before leaving, Scott arranged to give V&eacute;ry Lights at
10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> from Cape Evans on the first clear night of the
next three. To-night is the third, and the first clear night.
We were out punctually, and then as we watched a flare
blazed up, followed by quite a firework display. We all
went wild with excitement&mdash;knowing that all was well.
Meares ran in and soaked some awning with paraffin, and
we lifted it as an answering flare and threw it into the air
again and again, until it was burning in little bits all over
the snow. The relief was great.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Bowers must tell the story of the returning party:</p>

<p>&quot;We topped the ridges and headed for Erebus beyond
Castle Rock. It looked a little threatening at first, but
cleared a bit as we got on. It was quite interesting to be
breaking new ground. Scott is a fine stepper in a sledge,
and he set a fast and easy swing all the time. It was snowing
and misty when we got beyond the Hutton Cliffs, but
we pitched the tents for lunch before going down the slope.
There was no doubt that a blizzard was coming up. It
cleared during lunch, which we finished about 3.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
as it had been a long morning march.</p>

<p>&quot;It was just as well for us that the mist cleared, for the
slope was not only crevassed in one direction, but it ended
in a high ice-cliff. By working along we found a lowish
place about thirty feet down from top to bottom. Over
this we lowered men and sledges. It had started to blow
and the drift was flying off the cliff in clouds. We put in
a couple of strong male bamboos to lower the last man
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>away, leaving the Alpine rope there to facilitate ascent
(<i>i.e.</i> for any party returning to Hut Point with food). We
then repacked the sledges and headed across the bay towards
the Glacier Tongue, where we arrived after dark
about 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The young sea-ice was covered in a salt
deposit which made it like pulling a sledge over treacle
instead of ice, and it was very heavy going after the snow
uplands. The Tongue was mostly hard blue ice, which is
slipperiness itself, and crevassed every few yards. Most
of these were bridged, but you were continually pushing
a foot, or sometimes two, into nothingness, in the semi-darkness.
None of us, however, went down to the extent
of our harness.</p>

<p>&quot;Arrived on the other side we struck a sheltered dip,
where we decided to camp for something to eat. It was
after 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and I was for camping there for the night, as
it seemed to me folly to venture upon a piece of untried
newly frozen sea-ice in inky darkness, with a blizzard
coming up behind us. Against this of course we were only
five miles from Cape Evans, and though we had hardly any
grub with us, not having anticipated the cliff or the saltness
of the sea-ice, and having to set out to do the journey in one
day, I thought hunger in a sleeping-bag better than lying
out in a blizzard on less than one foot of young ice.</p>

<p>&quot;After a meal we started off at 9.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> in a snowy mist
in which we could literally see nothing. It had fallen calm
though, and at last we could see the outline of the nearest
of the Dellbridge Islands called the Great Razorback;
our course lay for a smaller island ahead called the Little
Razorback. As we neared the Little Razorback Island
the snow hid everything; in fact we could hardly see the
island itself when we were right under it. It was impossible
to go wandering on, so we had after all to camp on the sea-ice.
There was scarcely any snow to put on the valances of
the tents, and the wet salt soaked the bags, and you knew
that there was only about six or ten inches of precarious ice
between you and the black waters beneath. Altogether I
decided that I for one would lie awake in such an insecure
camp.<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></p>

<p>&quot;As expected the blizzard overtook us shortly after
midnight, and the shrieking of the wind among the rocks
above might have been pretty unpleasant had it not assured
me that we were still close to the island and not moving
seaward. Needless to say, I said that I was sure the camp
was as safe as a church. At daylight Taylor dived out and
in until the wind from the door blew out the ice valance and
the next moment the tent closed on us like an umbrella.
We would never have spread it again had not some of the
drift settled round us, and so we were able to secure it
after an hour or two. The air was full of thick drift, and to
work off some of Taylor's energy I said we might climb
the island and look for Cape Evans.</p>

<p>&quot;The island rose up straight from the sea at a sharp angle
all round, and we climbed it with difficulty. On the top
we saw the reason of its name, as it was absolutely so sharp
right along that you could bestride the top as though sitting
in a saddle. It was too windy sitting up there to be
pleasant, so we descended, having seen nothing but clouds
of flying snow, and the peak of Inaccessible Island. At the
bottom of the weather side we found a small ledge perfectly
flat and just big enough to take two tents pitched close
together. At this place the island made a wind buffer
and it was practically calm though the blizzard yelled all
round. I urged Captain Scott to camp on this ledge
and Taylor fizzled for making for Cape Evans, so Scott
decided to ensure Taylor's safety, as he put it, and we
made for the ledge. Once there we had an ideal camp
on good hard ground and no wind, and had we had
food the blizzard might have lasted a week for aught I
cared.</p>

<hr />


<p>&quot;We were two nights there and on the morning of the
13th it took off enough for us to head for home. We saw
Sunny Jim's [Simpson's] Observatory on the Hill, but still
did not know how the hut had fared till we got round the
cape into North Bay. There was the Winter Station all
intact, however, and though North Bay had only just
frozen in, it was strong enough to bear us safely. Somebody
saw us and in another moment the hut poured out
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>her little party, consisting of Sunny Jim, Ponting, Nelson,
Day, Lashly, Hooper, Clissold, Dimitri and Anton. Ponting's
face was a study as he ran up; he failed to recognize
any of us and stopped dead with a blank look&mdash;as he
admitted afterwards, he thought it was the Norwegian expedition
for the space of a moment; and then we were all
being greeted as heartily as if we had really done something
to be proud of.</p>

<p>&quot;The motors had had to be shifted, and a lot of gear
placed higher up the beach, but the water had never
reached near the hut, so all was well. Inside it looked tremendous,
and we looked at our grimy selves in a glass for
the first time for three months; no wonder Ponting did not
recognize the ruffians. He photographed a group of us,
which will amuse you some day, when it is permissible to
send photos. We ate heartily and had hot baths and generally
civilized ourselves. I have since concluded that the
hut is the finest place in the southern hemisphere, but
then I could not shake down to it at once. I hankered for a
sleeping-bag out on the snow, or for the blubbery atmosphere
of Hut Point. I expect the truth of the matter was
that all my special pals, Bill, Cherry, Titus, and Atch, had
been left behind.</p>

<p>&quot;We found eight ponies at Winter Quarters in the
stable, Hackenschmidt having died. These with our two
at Hut Point left us with ten to start the winter with. I
at once looked out the other big Siberian horse that had
been a pair with my late lamented (they were the only
Siberian ponies, all the rest being Manchurians) and
singled him out for myself, should 'the powers that be'
be willing.</p>

<p>&quot;A party had to return to Hut Point with some provision
in a day or two, so I asked to go. Captain Scott had decided
to go himself, but said he would be very pleased if I would
go too; so it being a fine day we left the following Monday.
The two teams consisted of Captain Scott, Lashly, Day
and Dimitri with one tent and sledge, and Crean, Hooper,
Nelson and myself with the other. We had it fine as far
as the Glacier Tongue; and then along came the cheery
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>old south wind in our faces; we crossed the Tongue and
struggled against this till we could camp under the Hutton
Cliffs where we got some shelter. All of us had our faces
frost-bitten, the washing and shaving having made mine
quite tender. It was a bit of a job getting up the cliff: we
had to stand on top of a pile of fallen ice and hoist a 10-feet
sledge on to our shoulders, at least on to the shoulders of
the tall ones; this just touched the overhanging cornice.
A cornice of snow is caused by continual drift over a sharp
edge: it takes all sorts of fantastic shapes, but usually
hangs over like this. Looking edgeways it looks as if it
must fall down, but as a matter of fact is usually very
tough indeed. In this case steps were cut in it with an ice
axe from our extemporary ladder, and Captain Scott and I
got up first. With the aid of a rope and the ladder we got
the light ones up first, and hauled up the gear last of all;
hanging the sledge from the top with one rope enabled
the last two to struggle up it assisted by a rope round them
from above. It was a cold job and more frost-bites occurred
in two of our novices, one on a foot and the other on a
finger.</p>

<p>&quot;We faced the blast again, but got it partially behind us
on reaching the Heights. We camped for the night under
Castle Rock on an inclined slope. It calmed down to a
glorious night with a low temperature. Crean and I lay
head down hill to make Nelson and Hooper&mdash;who had
never sledged before&mdash;more comfortable. As a result Crean
slipped half out of the tent and let in a cold stream of air
under the valance, for which I was at a loss to account
until the morning disclosed him thus, fast asleep of course.
It takes a lot to worry Captain Scott's coxswain.</p>

<p>&quot;We arrived at Hut Point and had a great reception
there, chiefly on account of the food we brought, particularly
the sugar. We had been living on some paraffin
sugar when I left before, and even this was finished. The
next day we stayed there to kill seals. Cherry and I skinned
one and then went for a walk round Cape Armitage. It was
blowing big guns off the cape, fairly fizzing in fact. We
went as far as Pram Point and then turned, coming in with
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>it behind us. I only had a thin balaclava and my ears were
nearly nipped.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Meanwhile those of us who had been left at Hut Point
with the ponies and dogs journeyed out one afternoon to
Safety Camp to get some more bales of compressed fodder.
Easter Sunday we spent in a howling blizzard, which
cleared in the afternoon sufficiently to see a golden sun
sinking into a sea of purple frost-smoke and drift.</p>

<p>I have it on record that we had tinned haddock this day
for breakfast, made by Oates with great care, a biscuit and
cheese hoosh for lunch, and a pemmican fry this evening,
followed by cocoa with a tin of sweetened Nestl&eacute;'s milk in
it, truly a great luxury. For the rest we mended our finnesko,
and read Bleak House. Meares told us how the
Chinese who were going to war with the Lolos (who are
one of the Eighteen tribes on the borders of Thibet and
China) tied the Lolo hostage to a bench, and, having cut
his throat, caught the blood which dripped from it. Into
this they dipped their flag, and then cut out the heart and
liver, which the officers ate, while the men ate the rest!</p>

<p>The relief party arrived on April 18: &quot;We had spent
such a happy week, just the seven of us, at the Discovery
hut that I think, glad as we were to see the men, we would
most of us have rather been left undisturbed, and I expected
that it would mean that we should have to move
homewards, as it turned out.</p>

<p>&quot;Meares is to be left in charge of the party which remains,
namely Forde and Keohane of the old stagers, and
Nelson, Day, Lashly and Dimitri of the new-comers. He is
very amusing with the stores and is evidently afraid that
the food which has just been brought in (sugar, self-raising
flour, chocolate, etc.) will all be eaten up by those who
have brought it. So we have dampers without butter, and
a minimum of chocolate.</p>

<p>&quot;Tuesday and Tuesday night was one of our few still,
cold days, nearly minus thirty. The sea northwards from
Hut Point, whence the ice had previously all gone out,
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>froze nearly five inches by Wednesday mid-day, when we
got three more seal. Scott was evidently thinking that on
Thursday, when we were to start, we might go by the sea-ice
all the way&mdash;when suddenly with no warning it silently
floated out to sea.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The following two teams travelled to Cape Evans via
the Hutton Cliffs on April 21: 1st team Scott, Wilson,
Atkinson, Crean; 2nd team Bowers, Oates, Cherry-Garrard,
Hooper. It was blowing hard, as usual, at the Hutton
Cliffs, and we got rather frost-bitten when lowering the
sledges on to the sea-ice. The sun was leaving us for the
next four months, but luckily the light just lasted for this
operation, though not for the subsequent meal which we
hastily ate under the cliffs, nor for the crossing of Glacier
Tongue. Bowers wrote home:</p>

<p>&quot;I had the lighter team and, knowing what a flier Captain
Scott is I took care to have the new sledge myself. Our
weights were nothing and the difference was only in the
sledge runners, but it made all the difference to us that
day. Scott fairly legged it, as I expected, and we came
along gaily behind him. He could not understand it when
the pace began to tell more on his heavy team than on us.
After lowering down the sledges over the cliffs we recovered
the rope we had left in the first place, and then struck out
over the sea-ice. Then our good runners told so much that
I owned up to mine being the better sledge, and offered to
give them one of my team. This was declined, but after we
crossed the Tongue Captain Scott said he would like to
change sledges at the Little Razorback. At any time over
this stretch we could have run away from his team, and once
they got our sledge they started that game on us. We expected
it, and never had I stepped out so hard before. We
had been marching hard for nearly 12 hours and now we
had two miles' spurt to do, and we should have stuck it,
bad runners and all, had we had smooth ice. As it was we
struck a belt of rough ice, and in the dark we all stumbled
and I went down a whack, that nearly knocked me out.
This was not noticed fortunately, and still we hung on to
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>the end of their sledge while I turned hot and cold and sick
and went through the various symptoms before I got my
equilibrium back, which I fortunately did while legging it at
full speed. They started to go ahead soon after that though,
and we could not hold our own, although we were close to
the cape. I had the same thing happen again after another
fall but we stuck it round the cape and arrived only about
50 yards behind. I have never felt so done, and so was
my team. Of course we need not have raced, but we did,
and I would do the same thing every time. Titus produced
a mug of brandy he had sharked from the ship and we all
lapped it up with avidity. The other team were just about
laid out, too, so I don't think there was much to be said
either way.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Two days later the sun appeared for the last time for
four months.</p>

<p>Looking back I realized two things. That sledging, at
any rate in summer and autumn, was a much less terrible
ordeal than my imagination had painted it, and that those
Hut Point days would prove some of the happiest in my
life. Just enough to eat and keep us warm, no more&mdash;no
frills nor trimmings: there is many a worse and more
elaborate life. The necessaries of civilization were luxuries
to us: and as Priestley found under circumstances compared
to which our life at Hut Point was a Sunday School
treat, the luxuries of civilization satisfy only those wants
which they themselves create.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The First Winter</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The highest object that human beings can set before themselves is not
the pursuit of any such chimera as the annihilation of the unknown; it is
simply the unwearied endeavour to remove its boundaries a little further
from our little sphere of action.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Huxley.</span></p></div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>And so we came back to our comfortable hut. Whatever
merit there may be in going to the Antarctic, once there
you must not credit yourself for being there. To spend a
year in the hut at Cape Evans because you explore is no
more laudable than to spend a month at Davos because you
have consumption, or to spend an English winter at the
Berkeley Hotel. It is just the most comfortable thing and
the easiest thing to do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>In our case the best thing was not at all bad, for the hut,
as Arctic huts go, was as palatial as is the Ritz, as hotels
go. Whatever the conditions of darkness, cold and wind,
might be outside, there was comfort and warmth and good
cheer within.</p>

<p>And there was a mass of work to be done, as well as at
least two journeys of the first magnitude ahead.</p>

<p>When Scott first sat down at his little table at Winter
Quarters to start working out a most complicated scheme
of weights and averages for the Southern Journey, his
thoughts were gloomy, I know. &quot;This is the end of the
Pole,&quot; he said to me, when he pulled us off the bergs after
the sea-ice had broken up; the loss of six ponies out of the
eight with which we started the Dep&ocirc;t Journey, the increasing
emaciation and weakness of the pony transport as
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>we travelled farther on the Barrier, the arrival of the dogs
after their rapid journey home, starved rakes which looked
as though they were absolutely done&mdash;these were not cheerful
recollections with which to start to plan a journey of
eighteen hundred miles.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we had ten ponies left, though two
or three of them were of more than doubtful quality; and
it was obvious that considerable improvement could and
must be made in the feeding of both ponies and dogs. With
regard to the dogs the remedy was plain; their ration was
too small. With regard to the ponies the question was not
so simple. One of the main foods for the ponies which we
had brought was compressed fodder in the shape of bales.
Theoretically this fodder was excellent food value, and was
made of wheat which was cut green and pressed. Whether
it was really wheat or not I do not know, but there could
be no two opinions about its nourishing qualities for our
ponies. When fed upon it they lost weight until they were
just skin and bone. Poor beasts! It was pitiful to see them.</p>

<p>In Oates we had a man who had forgotten as much as
most men know about horses. It was no fault of his that
this fodder was inadequate, nor that we had lost so many
of the best ponies which we had. Oates had always been
for taking the worst ponies out on the Dep&ocirc;t Journey:
travelling as far on to the Barrier as they could go, and
there killing them and dep&ocirc;ting their flesh. Now Oates
took the ten remaining ponies into his capable hands.
Some of them were scarecrows, especially poor Jehu, who
was never expected to start at all, and ended by gallantly
pulling his somewhat diminished load eight marches beyond
One Ton Camp, a distance of 238 miles. Another,
Christopher, was a man-killer if ever a horse was; he had
to be thrown in order to attach him to the sledge; to the
end he would lay out any man who was rash enough to
give him the chance; once started, and it took four men to
achieve this, it was impossible to halt him during the day's
march, and so Oates and his three tent mates and their
ponies had to go without any lunch meal for 130 miles of
the Southern Journey.<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></p>

<p>Oates trained them and fed them as though they were
to run in the Derby. They were exercised whenever possible
throughout the winter and spring by those who were to
lead them on the actual journey. Fresh and good food was
found in the shape of oilcake and oats, a limited quantity
of each of which had been brought and was saved for the
actual Polar Journey, and everything which care and foresight
could devise was done to save them discomfort. It is
a grim life for animals, but in the end we were to know that
up to the time of that bad blizzard almost at the Glacier
Gateway, which was the finishing post of these plucky
animals, they had fed all they needed, slept as well and
lived as well as any, and better than most horses in ordinary
life at home. &quot;I congratulate you, Titus,&quot; said Wilson, as
we stood under the shadow of Mount Hope, with the
ponies' task accomplished, and &quot;I thank you,&quot; said Scott.</p>

<p>Titus grunted and was pleased.</p>

<p>Transport difficulties for the Polar Journey were considerable,
but in every other direction the outlook was
bright. The men who were to do the sledging had been
away from Winter Quarters for three months. They had
had plenty of sledging experience, some of it none too soft.
The sledges, clothing, man-food, and outfit generally were
excellent, although some changes were suggested and could
be put into effect. There was no obvious means, however,
of effecting the improvement most desired, a satisfactory
snow-shoe for the ponies.</p>

<p>The work already accomplished was enormous. On the
Polar Journey the ponies and dogs could now travel light
for the first hundred and thirty geographical miles, when,
at One Ton Camp, they would for the first time take their
full loads: the advantage of being able to start again with
full loads when so far on your way is obvious when it is
considered that the distance travelled depends upon the
weight of food that can be carried. During the geological
journey on the western side of the Sound, Taylor and his
party had carried out much useful geological work in Dry
Valley and on the Ferrar and Koettlitz Glaciers, which had
been accurately plotted for the charts, and had been exam<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>ined
for the first time by an expert physiographer and ice
specialist. The ordinary routine of scientific and meteorological
observations usual with all Scott's sledging parties
was observed.</p>

<p>Further, at Cape Evans there had been running for more
than three months a scientific station, which rivalled in
thoroughness and exactitude any other such station in the
world. I hope that later a more detailed account may be
given of this continuous series of observations, some of
them demanding the most complex mechanism, and all of
them watched over by enthusiastic experts. It must here
suffice to say that we who on our return saw for the first
time the hut and its annexes completely equipped were
amazed; though perhaps the gadget which appealed most
to us at first was the electric apparatus by which the cook,
whose invention it was, controlled the rising of his excellent
bread.</p>

<p>Glad as we were to find it all and to enjoy the food,
bath and comfort which it offered, we had no illusions
about Cape Evans itself. It is uninteresting, as only a low-lying
spit of black lava covered for the most part with snow,
and swept constantly by high winds and drift, can be uninteresting.
The kenyte lava of which it is formed is a
remarkable rock, and is found in few parts of the world:
but when you have seen one bit of kenyte you have seen all.
Unlike the spacious and lofty Hut Point Peninsula, thirteen
miles to the south, it has no outstanding hills and craters;
no landmarks such as Castle Rock. Unlike the broad
folds of Cape Royds, six miles to the north, it has none of the
rambling walks and varied lakes, in which is found most
of the limited plant life which exists in these latitudes,
and though a few McCormick skuas meet here, there is
no nursery of penguins such as that which makes Cape
Royds so attractive in summer. Nor has the Great Ice
Sheet, which reached up Erebus and spread over the Ross
Sea in the past, spilled over Cape Evans in its retreat a
wealth of foreign granites, dolerites, porphyrys and sandstone
such as cover the otherwise dull surface round
Shackleton's old Winter Quarters.<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></p>

<p>Cape Evans is a low lava flow jutting out some three
thousand feet from the face of the glaciers which clothe the
slopes of Erebus. It is roughly an equilateral triangle in
shape, at its base some three thousand feet (9/16th mile)
across. This base-line, which divides the cape from the
slopes of Erebus and the crevassed glaciers and giant ice-falls
which clothe them, consists of a ramp with a slope
of thirty degrees, and a varying height of some 100 to
150 feet. From our hut, four hundred yards away, it
looks like a great embankment behind which rises the
majestic volcano Erebus, with its plume of steam and
smoke.</p>

<p>The cape itself does not rise on the average more than
thirty feet, and somewhat resembles the back of a hog with
several backbones. The hollows between the ridges are for
the most part filled with snow and ice, while in one or two
places where the accumulation of snow is great enough
there are little glacierets which do not travel far before they
ignominiously peter out. There are two small lakes, called
Skua Lake and Island Lake respectively. There is only one
hill which is almost behind the hut, and is called Wind
Vane Hill, for on it were placed one of our wind vanes and
certain other meteorological instruments. Into the glacieret
which flowed down in the lee of this hill we drove two caves,
which gave both an even low temperature and excellent
insulation. One of them was therefore used for our magnetic
observations, and the other as an ice-house for the
mutton we had brought from New Zealand.</p>

<p>The north side, upon which we had built our hut, slopes
down by way of a rubbly beach to the sea in North Bay. We
knew there was a beach for we landed upon it, but we never
saw it again even in the height of summer, for the winter
blizzards formed an ice foot several feet thick. The other
side of the cape ends abruptly in black bastions and baby
cliffs some thirty feet high. The apex of the triangle which
forms as it were the cape proper is a similar kenyte bluff.
The whole makes a tricky place on which to walk in the
dark, for the surface is strewn with boulders of all sizes and
furrowed and channelled by drifts of hard and icy snow,
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>and quite suddenly you may find yourself prostrate upon
a surface of slippery blue ice. It may be easily imagined
that it is no seemly place to exercise skittish ponies or
mules in a cold wind, but there is no other place when the
sea-ice is unsafe.</p>

<p>Come and stand outside the hut door. All round you,
except where the cape joins the mountain, is the sea. You
are facing north with your back to the Great Ice Barrier and
the Pole, with your eyes looking out of the mouth of
McMurdo Sound over the Ross Sea towards New Zealand,
two thousand miles of open water, pack and bergs.
Look over the sea to your left. It is mid-day, and though
the sun will not appear above the horizon he is still near
enough to throw a soft yellow light over the Western
Mountains. These form the coast-line thirty miles across
the Sound, and as they disappear northwards are miraged
up into the air and float, black islands in a lemon sky.
Straight ahead of you there is nothing to be seen but black
open sea, with a high light over the horizon, which you
know betokens pack; this is ice blink. But as you watch
there appears and disappears a little dark smudge. This
puzzles you for some time, and then you realize that this
is the mirage of some far mountain or of Beaufort Island,
which guards the mouth of McMurdo Sound against such
traffic as ever comes that way, by piling up the ice floes
across the entrance.</p>

<p>As you still look north, in the middle distance, jutting
out into the sea, is a low black line of land, with one excrescence.
This is Cape Royds, with Shackleton's old hut
upon it; the excrescence is High Peak, and this line marks
the first land upon the eastern side of McMurdo Sound
which you can see, and indeed is actually the most eastern
point of Ross Island. It disappears abruptly behind a high
wall, and if you let your eyes travel round towards your
right front you see that the wall is a perpendicular cliff two
hundred feet high of pure green and blue ice, which falls
sheer into the sea, and forms, with Cape Evans, on which
we stand, the bay which lies in front of our hut, and which
we called North Bay. This great ice-cliff with its crevasses,
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>towers, bastions and cornices, was a never-ending source
of delight to us; it forms the snout of one of the many
glaciers which slide down the slopes of Erebus: in smooth
slopes and contours where the mountain underneath is of
regular shape: in impassable icefalls where the underlying
surface is steep or broken. This particular ice stream is
called the Barne Glacier, and is about two miles across.
The whole background from our right front to our right
rear, that is from N.E. to S.E., is occupied by our massive
and volcanic neighbour, Erebus. He stands 13,500 feet
high. We live beneath his shadow and have both admiration
and friendship for him, sometimes perhaps tinged
with respect. However, there are no signs of dangerous
eruptive disturbances in modern times, and we feel pretty
safe, despite the fact that the smoke which issues from his
crater sometimes rises in dense clouds for many thousands
of feet, and at others the trail of his plume can be measured
for at least a hundred miles.</p>

<p>If you are not too cold standing about (it does not pay
to stand about at Cape Evans) let us make our way behind
the hut and up Wind Vane Hill. This is only some sixty-five
feet high, yet it dominates the rest of the cape and is
steep enough to require a scramble, even now when the
wind is calm. Look out that you do not step on the electric
wires which connect the wind-vane cups on the hill with
the recording dial in the hut. These cups revolve in the
wind, the revolutions being registered electrically: every
four miles a signal was sent to the hut, and a pen working
upon a chronograph registered one more step. There is
also a meteorological screen on the summit, which has to
be visited at eight o'clock each morning in all weathers.</p>

<hr />


<p>Arrived on the top you will now be facing south, that
is in the opposite direction to which you were facing before.
The first thing that will strike you is that the sea, now
frozen in the bays though still unfrozen in the open sound,
flows in nearly to your feet. The second, that though the
sea stretches back for nearly twenty miles, yet the horizon
shows land or ice in every direction. For a ship this is a
cul-de-sac, as Ross found seventy years ago. But as soon
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>as you have grasped these two facts your whole attention
will be riveted to the amazing sight on your left. Here are
the southern slopes of Erebus; but how different from those
which you have lately seen. Northwards they fell in broad
calm lines to a beautiful stately cliff which edged the sea.
But here&mdash;all the epithets and all the adjectives which denote
chaotic immensity could not adequately tell of them.
Visualize a torrent ten miles long and twenty miles broad;
imagine it falling over mountainous rocks and tumbling
over itself in giant waves; imagine it arrested in the twinkling
of an eye, frozen and white. Countless blizzards have
swept their drifts over it, but have failed to hide it. And it
continues to move. As you stand in the still cold air you
may sometimes hear the silence broken by the sharp reports
as the cold contracts it or its own weight splits it. Nature
is tearing up that ice as human beings tear paper.</p>

<p>The sea-cliff is not so high here, and is more broken up
by crevasses and caves, and more covered with snow. Some
five miles along the coast the white line is broken by a
bluff and black outcrop of rock; this is Turk's Head, and
beyond it is the low white line of Glacier Tongue, jutting
out for miles into the sea. We know, for we have already
crossed it, that there is a small frozen bay of sea-ice beyond,
but all we can see from Cape Evans is the base of the Hut
Point Peninsula, with a rock outcrop just showing where
the Hutton Cliffs lie. The Peninsula prevents us from
seeing the Barrier, though the Barrier wind is constantly
flowing over it, as the clouds of drift now smoking over the
Cliffs bear witness. Farther to the right still, the land is
clear: Castle Rock stands up like a sentinel, and beyond are
Arrival Heights and the old craters we have got to know
so well during our stay at Hut Point. The Discovery hut,
which would, in any case, be invisible at fifteen miles, is
round that steep rocky corner which ends the Peninsula,
due south from where we stand.</p>

<p>There remains undescribed the quadrant which stretches
to our right front from south to west. Just as we have previously
seen the line of the Western Mountains disappearing
to the north miraged up in the light of the mid-day sun,
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>so now we see the same line of mountains running south,
with many miles of sea or Barrier between us and them. On
the far southern horizon, almost in transit with Hut Point,
stands Minna Bluff, some ninety miles away, beyond which
we have laid the One Ton Dep&ocirc;t, and from this point, as
our eyes move round to the right, we see peak after peak of
these great mountain ranges&mdash;Discovery, Morning, Lister,
Hooker, and the glaciers which divide them one from
another. They rise almost without a break to a height of
thirteen thousand feet. Between us and them is the Barrier
to the south, and the sea to the north. Unless a blizzard is
impending or blowing, they are clearly visible, a gigantic
wall of snow and ice and rock, which bounds our view to
the west, constantly varied by the ever-changing colour of
the Antarctic. Beyond is the plateau.</p>

<p>We have not yet mentioned four islands which lie
within a radius of about three miles from where we stand.
The most important is a mile from the end of Cape Evans
and is called Inaccessible Island, owing to the inhospitality
of its steep lava side, even when the sea is frozen; we
found a way up, but it is not a very interesting place. Tent
Island lies farther out and to the south-west. The remaining
two, which are more islets than islands, rise in
front of us in South Bay. They are called Great and Little
Razorback, being ribs of rock with a sharp divide in the
centre. The latter of these is the refuge upon which Scott's
party returning to Cape Evans pitched their camp when
overtaken by a blizzard some weeks ago. All these islands
are of volcanic origin and black in general colour, but
I believe there is evidence to show that the lava stream
which created them flowed from McMurdo Sound rather
than from the more obvious craters of Erebus. Their importance
in this story is the indirect help they gave in
holding in sea-ice against southerly blizzards, and in forming
landmarks which proved useful more than once to men
who had lost their bearings in darkness and thick weather.
In this respect also several icebergs which sailed in from
the Ross Sea and grounded on the shallows which run
between Inaccessible Island and the cape, as well as in<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>
South Bay, were most useful as well as being interesting
and beautiful. For two years we watched the weathering
of these great towers and bastions of ice by sea and sun and
wind, and left them still lying in the same positions, but
mere tumbled ruins of their former selves.</p>

<p>Many places in the panorama we have examined show
black rock, and the cape on which we stand exposes at
times more black than white. This fact always puzzles
those who naturally conclude that all the Antarctic is
covered with ice and snow. The explanation is simple,
that winds of the great velocity which prevails in this region
will not only prevent snow resting to windward of out-cropping
rocks and cliffs, but will even wear away the rocks
themselves. The fact that these winds always blow from
the south, or southerly, causes a tendency for this aspect of
any projecting rock to be blown free from snow, while the
north or lee side is drifted up by a marbled and extremely
hard tongue of snow, which disappears into a point at a
distance which depends upon the size of the rock.</p>

<p>Of course for the most part the land is covered to such a
depth by glaciers and snow that no wind will do more than
pack the snow or expose the ice beneath. At the same time,
to visualize the Antarctic as a white land is a mistake, for,
not only is there much rock projecting wherever mountains
or rocky capes and islands rise, but the snow seldom looks
white, and if carefully looked at will be found to be shaded
with many colours, but chiefly with cobalt blue or rose-madder,
and all the gradations of lilac and mauve which
the mixture of these colours will produce. A White Day
is so rare that I have recollections of going out from the
hut or the tent and being impressed by the fact that the
snow really looked white. When to the beautiful tints in
the sky and the delicate shading on the snow are added
perhaps the deep colours of the open sea, with reflections
from the ice foot and ice-cliffs in it, all brilliant blues and
emerald greens, then indeed a man may realize how beautiful
this world can be, and how clean.</p>

<p>Though I may struggle with inadequate expression to
show the reader that this pure Land of the South has many
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>gifts to squander upon those who woo her, chiefest of these
gifts is that of her beauty. Next, perhaps, is that of grandeur
and immensity, of giant mountains and limitless spaces,
which must awe the most casual, and may well terrify the
least imaginative of mortals. And there is one other gift
which she gives with both hands, more prosaic, but almost
more desirable. That is the gift of sleep. Perhaps it is true
of others as is certainly the case with me, that the more
horrible the conditions in which we sleep, the more soothing
and wonderful are the dreams which visit us. Some of
us have slept in a hurricane of wind and a hell of drifting
snow and darkness, with no roof above our heads, with no
tent to help us home, with no conceivable chance that we
should ever see our friends again, with no food that we
could eat, and only the snow which drifted into our sleeping-bags
which we could drink day after day and night after
night. We slept not only soundly the greater part of these
days and nights, but with a certain numbed pleasure.
We wanted something sweet to eat: for preference tinned
peaches in syrup! Well! That is the kind of sleep the
Antarctic offers you at her worst, or nearly at her worst.
And if the worst, or best, happens, and Death comes for
you in the snow, he comes disguised as Sleep, and you
greet him rather as a welcome friend than as a gruesome
foe. She treats you thus when you are in the extremity of
peril and hardship; perhaps then you can imagine what
draughts of deep and healthy slumber she will give a tired
sledger at the end of a long day's march in summer, when
after a nice hot supper he tucks his soft dry warm furry bag
round him with the light beating in through the green silk
tent, the homely smell of tobacco in the air, and the only
noise that of the ponies tethered outside, munching their
supper in the sun.</p>

<p>And so it came about that during our sojourn at Cape
Evans, in our comfortable warm roomy home, we took our
full allotted span of sleep. Most were in their bunks by
10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, sometimes with a candle and a book, not rarely
with a piece of chocolate. The acetylene was turned off at
10.30, for we had a limited quantity of carbide, and soon the
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>room was in complete darkness, save for the glow of the
galley stove and where a splash of light showed the night
watchman preparing his supper. Some snored loudly, but
none so loud as Bowers; others talked in their sleep, the
more so when some nasty experience had lately set their
nerves on edge. There was always the ticking of many
instruments, and sometimes the ring of a little bell: to
this day I do not know what most of them meant. On a
calm night no sound penetrated except, perhaps, the whine
of a dog, or the occasional kick of a pony in the stable outside.
Any disturbance was the night watchman's job. But
on a bad blizzard night the wind, as it tore seawards over
the hut, roared and howled in the ventilator let into the
roof: in the more furious gusts the whole hut shook, and
the pebbles picked up by the hurricane scattered themselves
noisily against the woodwork of the southern wall.
We did not get many nights like these the first winter;
during the second we seemed to get nothing else. One
ghastly blizzard blew for six weeks.</p>

<p>The night watchman took his last hourly observation
at 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and was free to turn in after waking the cook and
making up the fire. Frequently, however, he had so much
work to do that he preferred to forgo his sleep and remain
up. For instance, if the weather looked threatening, he
would take his pony out for exercise as soon as possible in
the morning, or those lists of stores were not finished, or
that fish trap had to be looked after: all kinds of things.</p>

<p>A sizzling on the fire and a smell of porridge and fried
seal liver heralded breakfast, which was at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> in theory
and a good deal later in practice. A sleepy eye might see
the meteorologist stumping out (Simpson always stumped)
to change the records in his magnetic cave and visit his
instruments on the Hill. Twenty minutes later he would
be back, as often as not covered with drift and his wind
helmet all iced up. Meanwhile, the more hardy ones were
washing: that is, they rubbed themselves, all shivering,
with snow, of a minus temperature, and pretended they
liked it. Perhaps they were right, but we told them it was
swank. I'm not sure that it wasn't! It should be explained
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>that water was seldom possible in a land where ice is more
abundant than coal.</p>

<p>One great danger threatened all our meals in this hut,
namely that of a Cag. A Cag is an argument, sometimes
well informed and always heated, upon any subject under
the sun, or temporarily in our case, the moon. They ranged
from the Pole to the Equator, from the Barrier to Portsmouth
Hard and Plymouth Hoe. They began on the
smallest of excuses, they continued through the widest field,
they never ended; they were left in mid air, perhaps to be
caught up again and twisted and tortured months after.
What caused the cones on the Ramp; the formation of ice
crystals; the names and order of the public-houses if you
left the Main Gate of Portsmouth Dockyard and walked
to the Unicorn Gate (if you ever reached so far); the best
kinds of crampons in the Antarctic, and the best place in
London for oysters; the ideal pony rug; would the wine
steward at the Ritz look surprised if you asked him for
a pint of bitter? Though the Times Atlas does not rise
to public-houses nor Chambers's Encyclopaedia sink to
behaviour at our more expensive hotels, yet they settled
more of these disputes than anything else.</p>

<p>On the day we are discussing, though mutterings can
still be heard from Nelson's cubicle, the long table has
been cleared and every one is busy by 9.30. From now
until supper at 7 work is done by all in some form or
other, except for a short luncheon interval. I do not mean
for a minute that we all sit down, as a man may do in
an office at home, and solidly grind away for upwards of
nine hours or more. Not a bit of it. We have much work
out of doors, and exercise is a consideration of the utmost
importance. But when we go out, each individual quite
naturally takes the opportunity to carry out such work as
concerns him, whether it deals with ice or rocks, dogs or
horses, meteorology or biology, tide-gauges or balloons.</p>

<p>When blizzards allowed, the ponies were exercised by
their respective leaders between breakfast and mid-day,
when they were fed. This exercising of animals might be a
pleasant business, on the other hand it could be the deuce
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>and all: it depended on the pony and the weather. A
blubber fire was kept burning in the snug stable, which
was built against the lee wall of the hut: the ponies were,
therefore, quite warm, and found it chilly directly they
were led outside, even if there was no wind.</p>

<p>The difficulties of exercising them in the dark were so
great that with the best intentions in the world it was difficult
to give them sufficient work for the good feeding they
received. Add to this the fact that one at any rate of these
variable animals was really savage, and that most of them
were keen to break away if possible, and the hour of exercise
was not without its thrills even on the calmest and
most moonlight days. The worst days were those when it
was difficult to say whether the ponies should be taken out
on the sea-ice or not. It was thick weather that was to be
feared, for then, if the leader once lost his bearings, it was
most difficult for him to return. An overcast sky, light
falling snow, perhaps a light northerly wind generally
meant a blizzard, but the blizzard might not break for
twenty-four hours, it might be upon you in four seconds.
It was difficult to say whether the pony should miss his
exercise, whether the fish trap should be raised, whether
to put off your intended trip to Cape Royds. Generally the
risks were taken, for, on the whole, it is better to be a little
over-bold than a little over-cautious, while always there
was a something inside urging you to do it just because
there was a certain risk, and you hardly liked not to do it.
It is so easy to be afraid of being afraid!</p>

<p>Let me give one instance: it must be typical of many.
It was thick as it could be, no moon, no stars, light falling
snow, and not even a light breeze to keep in your face to
give direction. Bowers and I decided to take our ponies
out, and once over the tide crack, where the working sea-ice
joins the fast land-ice, we kept close under the tall cliffs
of the Barne Glacier. So far all was well, and also when
we struck along a small crack into the middle of the bay,
where there was a thermometer screen. This we read with
some difficulty by the light of a match and started back
towards the hut. In about a quarter of an hour we knew
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>we were quite lost until an iceberg which we recognized
showed us that we had been walking at right angles to our
course, and got us safe home.</p>

<p>On a clear crisp day, with the full moon to show you the
ridges and cracks and sastrugi, it was most pleasant to put
on your ski and wander forth with no object but that of
healthy pleasure. Perhaps you would make your way round
the bluff end of the cape and strike southwards. Here you
may visit Nelson working with his thermometers and current
meters and other instruments over a circular hole in
the ice, which he keeps open from day to day by breaking
out the 'biscuit' of newly formed ice. He has connected
himself with the hut by telephone, and built round himself
an igloo of drifted snow and the aforesaid 'biscuits,' which
effectually shelter him from the wind. Or you may meet
Meares and Dimitri returning with the dog-teams from a
visit to Hut Point. A little farther on the silence is complete.
But now your ear catches the metallic scratch of ski
sticks on hard ice; there is some one else ski-ing over
there, it may be many miles away, for sound travels in an
amazing way. Every now and then there comes a sharp
crack like a pistol shot; it is the ice contracting in the
glaciers of Erebus, and you know that it is getting colder.
Your breath smokes, forming white rime over your face,
and ice in your beard; if it is very cold you may actually
hear it crackle as it freezes in mid air!</p>

<p>These were the days which remain visibly in the mind
as the most enjoyable during this first winter season. It
was all so novel, these much-dreaded, and amongst us
much-derided, terrors of the Long Winter Night. The
atmosphere is very clear when it is not filled with snow or
ice crystals, and the moonlight lay upon the land so that we
could see the main outlines of the Hut Point Peninsula,
and even Minna Bluff out on the Barrier ninety miles away.
The ice-cliffs of Erebus showed as great dark walls, but
above them the blue ice of the glaciers gleamed silvery,
and the steam flowed lazily from the crater carried away
in a long line, showing us that the northerly breezes prevailed
up there, and were storing up trouble in the south.<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>
Sometimes a shooting star would seem to fall right into the
mountain, and for the most part the Aurora flitted uneasily
about in the sky.</p>

<p>The importance of plenty of out-door exercise was
generally recognized, and our experience showed us that
the happiest and healthiest members of our party during
this first year were those who spent the longest period in
the fresh air. As a rule we walked and worked and ski-ed
alone, not I feel sure because of any individual distaste for
the company of our fellows but rather because of a general
inclination to spend a short period of the day without company.
At least this is certainly true of the officers: I am
not so sure about the men. Under the circumstances, the
only time in the year that a man could be alone was in his
walks abroad from Winter Quarters, for the hut, of course,
was always occupied, and when sledging this sardine-like
existence was continuous night and day.</p>

<p>There was one regular exception to this rule. Every
possible evening, that is to say if it was not blowing a full
blizzard, Wilson and Bowers went up the Ramp together
'to read Bertram.' Now this phrase will convey little meaning
without some explanation. I have already spoken of the
Ramp as the steep rubbly slope partly covered by snow
and partly by ice which divided the cape on which we
lived from the glaciated slopes of Erebus. After a breathless
scramble up this embankment one came upon a belt
of rough boulder-strewn ground from which arose at intervals
conical mounds, the origin of which puzzled us for
many months. At length, by the obvious means of cutting
a section through one of them, it was proved that there
was a solid kenyte lava block in the centre of this cone,
proving that the whole was formed by the weathering of a
single rock. Threading your way for some hundreds of
yards through this terrain, a scramble attended by many
slips and falls on a dark night, you reached the first signs
of glaciation. A little farther, isolated in the ice stream, is
another group of debris cones, and on the largest of these
we placed meteorological Screen &quot;B,&quot; commonly called
Bertram. This screen, together with &quot;A&quot; (Algernon) and<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>
&quot;C&quot; (Clarence), which were in North and South Bays respectively,
were erected by Bowers, who thought, rightly,
that they would form an object to which men could guide
their walks, and that at the same time the observations of
maximum, minimum and present temperatures would be
a useful check to the meteorologist when he came to compare
them with those taken at the hut. As a matter of
fact the book in which we used to enter these observations
shows that the air temperatures out on the sea-ice
vary considerably from those on the cape, and that the
temperatures several hundred feet up on the slopes of
Erebus are often several degrees higher than those taken
at sea-level. I believe that much of the weather in this
part of the world is an intensely local affair, and these
screens produced useful data.</p>

<p>Wilson and Bowers would go up the Ramp when it was
blowing and drifting fairly hard, so that although the rocks
and landmarks immediately round them were visible, all
beyond was blotted out. It is quite possible to walk thus
among landmarks which you know at a time when it is
most unwise to go out on to the sea-ice where there are no
fixed points to act as a guide.</p>

<p>It was Wilson's pleasant conceit to keep his balaclava
rolled up, so that his face was bare, on such occasions,
being somewhat proud of the fact that he had not, as yet,
been frost-bitten. Imagine our joy when he entered the hut
one cold windy evening with two white spots on his cheeks
which he vainly tried to hide behind his dogskin mitts.</p>

<hr />


<p>The ponies' lunch came at mid-day, when they were
given snow to drink and compressed fodder with oats or
oil-cake on alternate days to eat, the proportion of which
was arranged according to the work they were able to do
in the present, or expected to do in the future. Our own
lunch was soon after one, and a few minutes before that
time Hooper's voice would be heard: &quot;Table please, Mr.
Debenham,&quot; and all writing materials, charts, instruments
and books would have to be removed. On Sunday, this
table displayed a dark blue cloth, but for meals and at all
other times it was covered with white oilcloth.<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></p>

<p>Lunch itself was a pleasant meatless meal, consisting of
limited bread and butter with plenty of jam or cheese,
tea or cocoa, the latter being undoubtedly a most useful
drink in a cold country. Many controversies raged over
the rival merits of tea and cocoa. Some of us made for ourselves
buttered toast at the galley fire; I must myself confess
to a weakness for Welsh Rarebit, and others followed
my example on cheese days in making messes of which we
were not a little proud. Scott sat at the head of the table,
that is at the east end, but otherwise we all took our places
haphazard from meal to meal as our conversation, or want
of it, merited, or as our arrival found a vacant chair. Thus
if you felt talkative you might always find a listener in
Debenham; if inclined to listen yourself it was only necessary
to sit near Taylor or Nelson; if, on the other hand,
you just wanted to be quiet, Atkinson or Oates would, probably,
give you a congenial atmosphere.</p>

<p>There was never any want of conversation, largely due
to the fact that no conversation was expected: we most of
us know the horrible blankness which comes over our
minds when we realize that because we are eating we are
also supposed to talk, whether we have anything to say or
not. It was also due to the more primitive reason that in a
company of specialists, whose travels extended over most
parts of the earth, and whose subjects overlapped and
interlocked at so many points, topics of conversation were
not only numerous but full of possibilities of expansion.
Add to this that from the nature of our work we were
probably people of an inquisitive turn of mind and wanted
to get to the bottom of the subjects which presented themselves,
and you may expect to find, as was in fact the case,
an atmosphere of pleasant and quite interesting conversation
which sometimes degenerated into heated and noisy
argument.</p>

<p>The business of eating over, pipes were lit without
further formality. I mention pipes only because while
we had a most bountiful supply of tobacco, the kindly
present of Mr. Wills, our supply of cigarettes from the
same source was purposely limited and only a small quan<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>tity
were landed, allowing of a ration to such members who
wished. Consequently cigarettes were an article of some
value, and in a land where the ordinary forms of currency
are valueless they became a frequent stake to venture when
making bets. Indeed, &quot;I bet you ten cigarettes,&quot; or &quot;I
bet you a dinner when we get back to London,&quot; became
the most frequent bids of the argumentative gambler, occasionally
varied when the bettor was more than usually certain
of the issue by the offer of a pair of socks.</p>

<p>By two o'clock we were dispersed once more to our
various works and duties. If it was bearable outside, the
hut would soon be empty save for the cook and a couple of
seamen washing up the plates; otherwise every one went
out to make the most of any glimmering of daylight which
still came to us from the sun below the northern horizon.
And here it may be explained that whereas in England the
sun rises more or less in the east, is due south at mid-day,
and sets in the west, this is not the case in the Antarctic
regions. In the latitude in which we now lived the sun is
at his highest at mid-day in the north, at his lowest at midnight
in the south. As is generally known he remains
entirely above the horizon for four months of the summer
(October-February) and entirely below the horizon for
four months in the winter (April 21-August 21). About
February 27, the end of summer, he begins to set and
rise due south at midnight; the next day he sets a little
earlier and dips a little deeper. During March and April
he is going deeper and deeper every day, until, by the
middle of April, he is set all the time except for just a peep
over the northern horizon at mid-day, which is his last
farewell before he goes away.</p>

<p>The reverse process takes place from August 21 onwards.
On this date the sun just peeped above the sea to
the north of our hut. The next day he rose a little higher
and longer, and in a few weeks he was rising well in the
east and sinking behind the Western Mountains. But he
did not stop there. Soon he was rising in the S.E. until in
the latter days of September he never rose, for he never set;
but circled round us by day and night. On Midsummer<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>
Day (December 21) at the South Pole the sun circles round
for twenty-four hours without changing his altitude for one
minute of a degree, but elsewhere he is always rising in the
sky until mid-day in the north and falling from that time
until midnight in the south.</p>

<p>Often, far too often, it was blizzing, and it was impossible
to go out except into the camp to take the observations,
to care for the dogs, to get ice for water or to
bring in stores. Even a short excursion of a few yards had
to be made with great care under such circumstances, and
certainly no one went outside more than was necessary, if
only because one was obliged to dig the accumulated drift
from the door before it was possible to proceed. Blizzard
or no blizzard, most men were back in the hut soon after
four, and from then until 6.30 worked steadily at their
jobs. As supper time approached some kindly-disposed
person would sit down and play on the Broadwood pianola
which was one of our blessings, and so it was that we came
to supper with good tempers as well as keen appetites.</p>

<p>Soup, in which the flavour of tomatoes occurred all too
frequently, followed by seal or penguin, and twice a week
by New Zealand mutton, with tinned vegetables, formed
the basis of our meal, and this was followed by a pudding.
We drank lime juice and water which sometimes included
a suspicious penguin flavour derived from the ice slopes
from which our water was quarried.</p>

<p>During our passage out to New Zealand in the ship (or
as Meares always insisted on calling her, the steamer) it
was our pleasant custom to have a glass of port or a liqueur
after dinner. Alas, we had this no longer: after leaving
New Zealand space allowed of little wine being carried
in the Terra Nova, even if the general medical opinion of
the expedition had not considered its presence undesirable.
We had, however, a few cases for special festivals, as well
as some excellent liqueur brandy which was carried as
medical comforts on our sledge journeys. Any officer who
allowed the distribution of this luxury on nearing the end
of a journey became extremely popular.</p>

<p>Lack of wine probably led to the suspension of a custom
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>which had prevailed on the Terra Nova, namely, the drinking
of the old toast of Saturday night, &quot;Sweethearts and
wives; may our sweethearts become our wives, and our
wives remain our sweethearts,&quot; and that more appropriate
(in our case) toast of Sunday, namely, &quot;absent friends.&quot;
We had but few married officers, though I must say most
survivors of the expedition hurried to remedy this single
state of affairs when they returned to civilization. Only
two of them are unmarried now. Most of them will probably
make a success of it, for the good Arctic explorer has
most of the defects and qualities of a good husband.</p>

<p>On the top of the pianola, close to the head of the table,
lived the gramophone; and under the one looking-glass
we possessed, which hung on the bulkhead of Scott's
cubicle, was a home-made box with shelves on which lay
our records. It was usual to start the gramophone after
dinner, and its value may be imagined. It is necessary to
be cut off from civilization and all that it means to enable
you to realize fully the power music has to recall the past,
or the depths of meaning in it to soothe the present and
give hope for the future. We had also records of good
classical music, and the kindly-disposed individual who
played them had his reward in the pleasant atmosphere
of homeliness which made itself felt. After dinner had
been cleared away, some men sat on at the table occupied
with books and games. Others dispersed to various jobs.
In the matter of games it was noticeable that one would
have its vogue and yield place to another without any
apparent reason. For a few weeks it might be chess, which
would then yield its place to draughts and backgammon,
and again come into favour. It is a remarkable fact that,
though we had playing cards with us none of our company
appeared desirous to use them. In fact I cannot remember
seeing a game of cards played except in the ship on the
voyage from England.</p>

<hr />


<p>With regard to books we were moderately well provided
with good modern fiction, and very well provided
with such authors as Thackeray, Charlotte Bront&euml;, Bulwer-Lytton
and Dickens. With all respect to the kind givers
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>of these books, I would suggest that the literature most
acceptable to us in the circumstances under which we did
most of our reading, that is in Winter Quarters, was the
best of the more recent novels, such as Barrie, Kipling,
Merriman and Maurice Hewlett. We certainly should
have taken with us as much of Shaw, Barker, Ibsen and
Wells as we could lay our hands on, for the train of ideas
started by these works and the discussions to which they
would have given rise would have been a godsend to us in
our isolated circumstances. The one type of book in which
we were rich was Arctic and Antarctic travel. We had a
library of these given to us by Sir Lewis Beaumont and Sir
Albert Markham which was very complete. They were
extremely popular, though it is probably true that these
are books which you want rather to read on your return
than when you are actually experiencing a similar life.
They were used extensively in discussions or lectures on
such polar subjects as clothing, food rations, and the building
of igloos, while we were constantly referring to them
on specific points and getting useful hints, such as the use
of an inner lining to our tents, and the mechanism of a
blubber stove.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the importance of maps and
books of reference, and these should include a good encyclopaedia
and dictionaries, English, Latin and Greek.
Oates was generally deep in Napier's History of the Peninsular
War, and some of us found Herbert Paul's History of
Modern England a great stand-by. Most of us managed
to find room in our personal gear when sledging for some
book which did not weigh much and yet would last. Scott
took some Browning on the Polar Journey, though I only
saw him reading it once; Wilson took Maud and In
Memoriam; Bowers always had so many weights to tally
and observations to record on reaching camp that I feel
sure he took no reading matter. Bleak House was the most
successful book I ever took away sledging, though a volume
of poetry was useful, because it gave one something to
learn by heart and repeat during the blank hours of the
daily march, when the idle mind is all too apt to think of
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>food in times of hunger, or possibly of purely imaginary
grievances, which may become distorted into real foundations
of discord under the abnormal strain of living for
months in the unrelieved company of three other men. If
your companions have much the same tastes as yourself it
is best to pool your allowance of weights and take one book
which will offer a wide field of thought and discussion. I
have heard Scott and Wilson bless the thought which led
them to take Darwin's Origin of Species on their first
Southern Journey. Such is the object of your sledging
book, but you often want the book which you read for half
an hour before you go to sleep at Winter Quarters to take
you into the frivolous fripperies of modern social life which
you may not know and may never wish to know, but which
it is often pleasant to read about, and never so much so as
when its charms are so remote as to be entirely tantalizing.</p>

<p>Scott, who always amazed me by the amount of work
he got through without any apparent effort, was essentially
the driving force of the expedition: in the hut quietly
organizing, working out masses of figures, taking the
greatest interest in the scientific work of the station, and
perhaps turning out, quite by the way, an elaborate paper
on an abstruse problem in the neighbourhood; fond of his
pipe and a good book, Browning, Hardy (Tess was one of
his favourites), Galsworthy. Barrie was one of his greatest
friends.</p>

<p>He was eager to accept suggestions if they were workable,
and always keen to sift even the most unlikely theories
if by any means they could be shaped to the desired end:
a quick and modern brain which he applied with thoroughness
to any question of practice or theory. Essentially an
attractive personality, with strong likes and dislikes, he
excelled in making his followers his friends by a few words
of sympathy or praise: I have never known anybody, man
or woman, who could be so attractive when he chose.</p>

<p>Sledging he went harder than any man of whom I have
ever heard. Men never realized Scott until they had gone
sledging with him. On our way up the Beardmore Glacier
we were going at top pressure some seventeen hours out of
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>the twenty-four, and when we turned out in the morning
we felt as though we had only just turned in. By lunch
time we felt that it was impossible to get through in the
afternoon a similar amount of work to that which we had
done in the morning. A cup of tea and two biscuits worked
wonders, and the first two hours of the afternoon's march
went pretty well, indeed they were the best hours' marching
of the day; but by the time we had been going some 4&frac12; or
5 hours we were watching Scott for that glance to right and
left which betokened the search for a good camping site.
&quot;Spell oh!&quot; Scott would cry, and then &quot;How's the enemy,
Titus?&quot; to Oates, who would hopefully reply that it was,
say, seven o'clock. &quot;Oh, well, I think we'll go on a little
bit more,&quot; Scott would say. &quot;Come along!&quot; It might be
an hour or more before we halted and made our camp:
sometimes a blizzard had its silver lining. Scott could not
wait. However welcome a blizzard could be to tired bodies
(I speak only of summer sledging), to Scott himself any
delay was intolerable. And it is hard to realize how difficult
waiting may be to one in a responsible position. It was
our simple job to follow, to get up when we were roused,
to pull our hardest, to do our special work as thoroughly
and quickly as possible; it was Scott who had to organize
distances and weights and food, as well as do the same
physical work as ourselves. In sledging responsibility and
physical work are combined to an extent seldom if ever
found elsewhere.</p>

<p>His was a subtle character, full of lights and shades.</p>

<p>England knows Scott as a hero; she has little idea of
him as a man. He was certainly the most dominating character
in our not uninteresting community: indeed, there
is no doubt that he would carry weight in any gathering of
human beings. But few who knew him realized how shy
and reserved the man was, and it was partly for this reason
that he so often laid himself open to misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Add to this that he was sensitive, femininely sensitive,
to a degree which might be considered a fault, and it will
be clear that leadership to such a man may be almost a
martyrdom, and that the confidence so necessary between
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>leader and followers, which must of necessity be based upon
mutual knowledge and trust, becomes in itself more difficult.
It wanted an understanding man to appreciate Scott
quickly; to others knowledge came with experience.</p>

<p>He was not a <i>very</i> strong man physically, and was in
his youth a weakly child, at one time not expected to live.
But he was well proportioned, with broad shoulders and
a good chest, a stronger man than Wilson, weaker than
Bowers or Seaman Evans. He suffered from indigestion,
and told me at the top of the Beardmore that he never expected
to go on during the first stage of the ascent.</p>

<p>Temperamentally he was a weak man, and might very
easily have been an irritable autocrat. As it was he had
moods and depressions which might last for weeks, and of
these there is ample evidence in his diary. The man with
the nerves gets things done, but sometimes he has a terrible
time in doing them. He cried more easily than any man I
have ever known.</p>

<p>What pulled Scott through was character, sheer good
grain, which ran over and under and through his weaker
self and clamped it together. It would be stupid to say he
had all the virtues: he had, for instance, little sense of
humour, and he was a bad judge of men. But you have
only to read one page of what he wrote towards the end to
see something of his sense of justice. For him justice was
God. Indeed I think you must read all those pages; and
if you have read them once, you will probably read them
again. You will not need much imagination to see what
manner of man he was.</p>

<p>And notwithstanding the immense fits of depression
which attacked him, Scott was the strongest combination
of a strong mind in a strong body that I have ever known.
And this because he was so weak! Naturally so peevish,
highly strung, irritable, depressed and moody. Practically
such a conquest of himself, such vitality, such push and
determination, and withal in himself such personal and
magnetic charm. He was naturally an idle man, he has
told us so;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> he had been a poor man, and he had a horror
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>of leaving those dependent upon him in difficulties. You
may read it over and over again in his last letters and
messages.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>He will go down to history as the Englishman who
conquered the South Pole and who died as fine a death as
any man has had the honour to die. His triumphs are many&mdash;but
the Pole was not by any means the greatest of them.
Surely the greatest was that by which he conquered his
weaker self, and became the strong leader whom we went
to follow and came to love.</p>

<hr />

<p>Scott had under him this first year in his Main Party
a total of 15 officers and 9 men. These officers may be
divided into three executive officers and twelve scientific
staff, but the distinction is very rough, inasmuch as a
scientist such as Wilson was every bit as executive as anybody
else, and the executive officers also did much scientific
work. I will try here briefly to give the reader some
idea of the personality and activities of these men as they
work any ordinary day in the hut. It should be noticed
that not all the men we had with us were brought to do
sledging work. Some were chosen rather for their scientific
knowledge than for their physical or other fitness for
sledging. The regular sledgers in this party of officers
were Scott, Wilson, Evans, Bowers, Oates (ponies), Meares
(dogs), Atkinson (surgeon), Wright (physicist), Taylor
(physiographer), Debenham (geologist), Gran and myself,
while Day was to drive his motors as far as they would
go on the Polar Journey. This leaves Simpson, who was
the meteorologist and whose observations had of necessity
to be continuous; Nelson, whose observations into marine
biology, temperatures of sea, salinity, currents and tides
came under the same heading; and Ponting, whose job
was photography, and whose success in this art everybody
recognizes.</p>

<p>However much of good I may write of Wilson, his
many friends in England, those who served with him on the
ship or in the hut, and most of all those who had the good
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>fortune to sledge with him (for it is sledging which is far
the greatest test) will all be dissatisfied, for I know that I
cannot do justice to his value. If you knew him you could
not like him: you simply had to love him. Bill was of the
salt of the earth. If I were asked what quality it was before
others that made him so useful, and so lovable, I think I
should answer that it was because he never for one moment
thought of himself. In this respect also Bowers, of whom
I will speak in a moment, was most extraordinary, and
in passing may I be allowed to say that this is a most
necessary characteristic of a good Antarctic traveller? We
had many such, officers and seamen, and the success of
the expedition was in no small measure due to the general
and unselfish way in which personal likes and dislikes,
wishes or tastes were ungrudgingly subordinated to the
common weal. Wilson and Pennell set an example of expedition
first and the rest nowhere which others followed
ungrudgingly: it pulled us through more than one difficulty
which might have led to friction.</p>

<p>Wilson was a man of many parts. He was Scott's right-hand
man, he was the expedition's Chief of the Scientific
Staff: he was a doctor of St. George's Hospital, and a
zoologist specializing in vertebrates. His published work
on whales, penguins and seals contained in the Scientific
Report of the Discovery Expedition is still the best available,
and makes excellent reading even to the non-scientist.
On the outward journey of the Terra Nova he was
still writing up his work for the Royal Commission on
Grouse Disease, the published report of which he never
lived to see. But those who knew him best will probably
remember Wilson by his water-colour paintings rather than
by any other form of his many-sided work.</p>

<p>As a boy his father sent him away on rambling holidays,
the only condition being that he should return with a
certain number of drawings. I have spoken of the drawings
which he made when sledging or when otherwise engaged
away from painting facilities, as at Hut Point. He
brought back to Winter Quarters a note-book filled with
such sketches of outlines and colours: of sunsets behind the<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>
Western Mountains: of lights reflected in the freezing sea
or in the glass houses of the ice foot: of the steam clouds
on Erebus by day and of the Aurora Australis by night.
Next door to Scott he rigged up for himself a table, consisting
of two venesta cases on end supporting a large
drawing-board some four feet square. On this he set to
work systematically to paint the effects which he had seen
and noted. He painted with his paper wet, and necessarily
therefore, he worked quickly. An admirer of Ruskin,
he wished to paint what he saw as truly as possible. If he
failed to catch the effect he wished, he tore up the picture
however beautiful the result he had obtained. There is no
doubt as to the faithfulness of his colouring: the pictures
recalled then and will still recall now in intimate detail the
effects which we saw together. As to the accuracy of his
drawing it is sufficient to say that in the Discovery Expedition
Scott wrote on his Southern Journey:</p>

<p>&quot;Wilson is the most indefatigable person. When it is
fine and clear, at the end of our fatiguing days he will
spend two or three hours seated in the door of the tent,
sketching each detail of the splendid mountainous coast-scene
to the west. His sketches are most astonishingly
accurate; I have tested his proportions by actual angular
measurement and found them correct.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the drawings of land, pack, icebergs
and Barrier, the primary object of which was scientific
and geographical, Wilson has left a number of paintings of
atmospheric phenomena which are not only scientifically
accurate but are also exceedingly beautiful. Of such are
the records of auroral displays, parhelions, paraselene, lunar
halos, fog bows, irridescent clouds, refracted images of
mountains and mirage generally. If you look at a picture
of a parhelion by Wilson not only can you be sure that the
mock suns, circles and shafts appeared in the sky as they
are shown on paper, but you can also rest assured that the
number of degrees between, say, the sun and the outer ring
of light were in fact such as he has represented them. You
can also be certain in looking at his pictures that if cirrus
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>cloud is shown, then cirrus and not stratus cloud was in the
sky: if it is not shown, then the sky was clear. It is accuracy
such as this which gives an exceptional value to work
viewed from a scientific standpoint. Mention should also
be made of the paintings and drawings made constantly by
Wilson for the various specialists on the expedition whenever
they wished for colour records of their specimens; in
this connection the paintings of fish and various parasites
are especially valuable.</p>

<p>I am not specially qualified to judge Wilson from the
artistic point of view. But if you want accuracy of drawing,
truth of colour, and a reproduction of the soft and
delicate atmospheric effects which obtain in this part of
the world, then you have them here. Whatever may be
said of the painting as such, it is undeniable that an artist
of this type is of inestimable value to an expedition which
is doing scientific and geographical work in a little-known
part of the earth.</p>

<p>Wilson himself set a low value on his artistic capacity.
We used to discuss what Turner would have produced in
a land which offered colour effects of such beauty. If we
urged him to try and paint some peculiar effect and he felt
that to do so was beyond his powers he made no scruple of
saying so. His colour is clear, his brush-work clean: and
he handled sledging subjects with the vigour of a professional
who knew all there was to be known about a
sledging life.</p>

<hr />


<p>Scott and Wilson worked hand in hand to further the
scientific objects of the expedition. For Scott, though no
specialist in any one branch, had a most genuine love of
science. &quot;Science&mdash;the rock foundation of all effort,&quot; he
wrote; and whether discussing ice problems with Wright,
meteorology with Simpson, or geology with Taylor, he
showed not only a mind which was receptive and keen to
learn, but a knowledge which was quick to offer valuable
suggestions. I remember Pennell condemning anything
but scientific learning in dealing with the problems round
us; 'no guesswork' was his argument. But he emphatically
made an exception of Scott, who had an uncanny knack
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>of hitting upon a solution. Over and over again in his
diary we can read of the interest he took in pure and
applied science, and it is doubtful whether this side of an
expedition in high northern or southern latitudes has ever
been more fortunate in their leader.</p>

<p>Wilson's own share in the scientific results is more
obvious because he was the director of the work. But no
published reports will give an adequate idea of the ability
he showed in co-ordinating the various interests of a varied
community, nor of the tact he displayed in dealing with
the difficulties which arose. Above all his judgment was
excellent, and Scott as well as the rest of us relied upon him
to a very great extent. The value of judgment in a land
where a wrong decision may mean disaster as well as loss
of life is beyond all price; weather in which changes are
most sudden is a case in point, also the state of sea-ice, the
direction to be followed in difficult country when sledging,
the best way of taking crevassed areas when they must be
crossed, and all the ways by which the maximum of result
may be combined with the minimum of danger in a land
where Nature is sometimes almost too big an enemy to
fight: all this wants judgment, and if possible experience.
Wilson could supply both, for his experience was as wide
as that of Scott, and I have constantly known Scott change
his mind after a talk with Bill. For the rest I give quotations
from Scott's diary:</p>

<p>&quot;He has had a hand in almost every lecture given, and
has been consulted in almost every effort which has been
made towards the solution of the practical or theoretical
problems of our Polar world.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p>&quot;Words must always fail me when I talk of Bill Wilson.
I believe he really is the finest character I ever met&mdash;the
closer one gets to him the more there is to admire. Every
quality is so solid and dependable; cannot you imagine
how that counts down here? Whatever the matter, one
knows Bill will be sound, shrewdly practical, intensely
loyal and quite unselfish. Add to this a wider knowledge
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>of persons and things than is at first guessable, a quiet
vein of humour and really consummate tact, and you have
some idea of his values. I think he is the most popular
member of the party, and that is saying much.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>And at the end, when Scott himself lay dying, he wrote
to Mrs. Wilson:</p>

<p>&quot;I can do no more to comfort you, than to tell you that
he died as he lived, a brave, true man&mdash;the best of comrades
and staunchest of friends.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Physically Scott had been a delicate boy but developed
into a strong man, 5 feet 9 inches in height, 11 stone 6 lbs.
in weight, with a chest measurement of 39&frac14; inches. Wilson
was not a particularly strong man. On leaving with the
Discovery he was but lately cured of consumption, yet he
went with Scott to his farthest South, and helped to get
Shackleton back alive. Shackleton owed his life to those
two. Wilson was of a slimmer, more athletic build, a great
walker, 5 feet 10&frac12; inches in height, 11 stones in weight,
with a chest measurement of 36 inches. He was an ideal
example of my contention, which I believe can be proved
many times over to be a fact, that it is not strength of body
but rather strength of will which carries a man farthest
where mind and body are taxed at the same time to their
utmost limit. Scott was 43 years of age at his death, and
Wilson 39.</p>

<p>Bowers was of a very different build. Aged 28, he
was only 5 feet 4 inches in height while his chest measurement
(which I give more as a general guide to his physique
than for any other reason) was 40 inches, and his weight
12 stones. He was recommended to Scott by Sir Clements
Markham, who was dining one day with Captain Wilson-Barker
on the Worcester, on which ship Bowers was
trained. Bowers was then home from India, and the talk
turned to the Antarctic. Wilson-Barker turned to Sir
Clements in the course of conversation and alluding to
Bowers said: &quot;Here is a man who will be leading one of
those expeditions some day.&quot;</p>

<p>He lived a rough life after passing from the Worcester
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>into the merchant service, sailing five times round the world
in the Loch Torridon. Thence he passed into the service
of the Royal Indian Marine, commanded a river gunboat
on the Irrawaddy, and afterwards served on H.M.S. Fox,
where he had considerable experience, often in open boats,
preventing the gun-running which was carried on by the
Afghans in the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Thence he came to us.</p>

<p>It is at any rate a curious fact, and it may be a significant
one, that Bowers, who enjoyed a greater resistance
to cold than any man on this expedition, joined it direct
from one of the hottest places on the globe. My knowledge
is insufficient to say whether it is possible that any trace
can be found here of cause and effect, especially since the
opposite seems to be the more common experience, in that
such people as return from India to England generally find
the English winter trying. I give the fact for what it may
be worth, remarking only that the cold of an English
winter is generally damp, while that of the Antarctic is dry,
so far at any rate as the atmosphere is concerned. Bowers
himself always professed the greatest indifference not only
to cold, but also to heat, and his indifference was not that
of a 'poseur,' as many experiences will show.</p>

<p>At the same time he was temperamentally one who
refused to admit difficulties. Indeed, if he did not actually
welcome them he greeted them with scorn, and in scorning
went far to master them. Scott believed that difficulties
were made to be overcome: Bowers certainly believed that
he was the man to overcome them. This self-confidence
was based on a very deep and broad religious feeling, and
carried conviction with it. The men swore by him both on
the ship and ashore. &quot;He's all right,&quot; was their judgment
of his seamanship, which was admirable. &quot;I like being with
Birdie, because I always know where I am,&quot; was the remark
made to me by an officer one evening as we pitched the
tent. We had just been spending some time in picking up
a dep&ocirc;t which a less able man might well have missed.</p>

<p>As he was one of the two or three greatest friends of my
life I find it hard to give the reader a mental picture of<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>
Birdie Bowers which will not appear extravagant. There
were times when his optimism appeared forced and formal
though I believe it was not really so: there were times
when I have almost hated him for his infernal cheerfulness.
To those accustomed to judge men by the standards of
their fashionable and corseted drawing-rooms Bowers appeared
crude. &quot;You couldn't kill that man if you took a
pole-axe to him,&quot; was the comment of a New Zealander at
a dance at Christchurch. Such men may be at a discount
in conventional life; but give me a snowy ice-floe waving
about on the top of a black swell, a ship thrown aback, a
sledge-party almost shattered, or one that has just upset
their supper on to the floorcloth of the tent (which is much
the same thing), and I will lie down and cry for Bowers to
come and lead me to food and safety.</p>

<p>Those whom the gods love die young. The gods loved
him, if indeed it be benevolent to show your favourites a
clear, straight, shining path of life, with plenty of discomfort
and not a little pain, but with few doubts and no fears.
Browning might well have had Bowers in mind when he
wrote of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>One who never turned his back, but marched breast forward;<br /></span>
<span>Never doubted clouds would break;<br /></span>
<span>Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph;<br /></span>
<span>Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sleep to wake.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was nothing subtle about him. He was transparently
simple, straightforward and unselfish. His capacity
for work was prodigious, and when his own work happened
to take less than his full time he characteristically found
activity in serving a scientist or exercising an animal. So
he used to help to send up balloons with self-recording
instruments attached to them, and track the threads which
led to them when detached. He was responsible for putting
up the three outlying meteorological screens and read
them more often than anybody else. At times he looked
after some of the dogs because at the moment there was
nobody else whose proper job it happened to be, and he
took a particular fancy to one of our strongest huskies
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>called Krisravitza, which is the Russian (so I'm told) for
'most beautiful.' This fancy originated in the fact that to
Kris, as the most truculent of our untamed devils, fell a large
share of well-deserved punishment. A living thing in
trouble be it dog or man was something to be helped.
Being the smallest man in the party he schemed to have
allotted to him the largest pony available both for the
Dep&ocirc;t and Polar Journeys. Their exercise, when he succeeded,
was a matter for experiment, for his knowledge of
horses was as limited as his love of animals was intense.
He started to exercise his second pony (for the first was
lost on the floe) by riding him. &quot;I'll soon get used to
him,&quot; he said one day when Victor had just deposited
him in the tide-crack, &quot;to say nothing of his getting used
to me,&quot; he added in a more subdued voice.</p>

<p>This was open-air work, and as such more congenial
than that which had to be done inside the hut. But his
most important work was indoors, and he brought to it
just the same restless enthusiasm which allowed no leisure
for reading or relaxation.</p>

<p>He joined as one of the ship's officers in London.
Given charge of the stores, the way in which he stowed
the ship aroused the admiration of even the stevedores,
especially when he fell down the main hatch one morning
on to the pig-iron below, recovered consciousness in about
half a minute, and continued work for the rest of the day
as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p>As the voyage out proceeded it became obvious that his
knowledge of the stores and undefeatable personality would
be of great value to the shore party, and it was decided that
he should land, to his great delight. He was personally responsible
for all food supplies, whether for home consumption
or for sledging, for all sledging stores and the distribution
of weights, the loading of sledges, the consumption
of coal, the issue of clothing, bosun's stores, and carpenter's
stores. Incidentally the keeper of stores wanted a very exact
knowledge of the cases which contained them, for the drifts
of snow soon buried them as they lay in the camp outside.</p>

<p>As time proved his capacity Scott left one thing after
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>another in Bowers' hands. Scott was a leader of men, and
it is a good quality in such to delegate work from themselves
on to those who prove their power to shoulder the
burden. Undoubtedly Bowers saved Scott a great deal of
work, and gave him time which he might not otherwise
have been able to spare to interest himself in the scientific
work of the station, greatly to its benefit, and do a good
deal of useful writing. The two ways in which Bowers
helped Scott most this winter were in the preparation
of the plans and the working out of the weights of the
Southern Journey, which shall be discussed later, and in
the routine work of the station, for which he was largely
responsible, and which ran so smoothly that I am unable
to tell the reader how the stores were issued, or the dinner
settled, by what rule the working parties for fetching ice
for water and other kindred jobs about the camp were
ordered. They just happened, and I don't know how. I
only know that Bowers had the bunk above mine in the
hut, and that when I was going to sleep he was generally
standing on a chair and using his own bunk as a desk,
and I conclude from the numerous lists of stores and
weights which are now in my hands that these were being
produced. Anyway the job was done, and the fact that
we knew nothing about it goes far to prove how efficiently
it was carried through.</p>

<p>For him difficulties simply did not exist. I have never
known a more buoyant, virile nature. Scott's writings
abound in references to the extraordinary value he placed
upon his help, and after the share which he took in the
Dep&ocirc;t and Winter Journeys it was clear that he would
probably be taken in the Polar Party, as indeed proved to
be the case. No man of that party better deserved his place.
&quot;I believe he is the hardest traveller that ever undertook
a Polar Journey, as well as one of the most undaunted.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The standard is high.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-29.jpg"><img src="./images/1-29_th.jpg" alt="Frozen Sea And Cliffs Of Ice" title="Frozen Sea And Cliffs Of Ice" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Frozen Sea And Cliffs Of Ice</span></p>
<hr />


<p>Bowers gave us two of our best lectures, the first on
the Evolution of Sledge Foods, at the end of which he discussed
our own rations on the Dep&ocirc;t Journey, and made
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>suggestions which he had worked out scientifically for those
of the Polar Journey. His arguments were sound enough
to disarm the hostility if not to convert to his opinions at
least one scientist who had come to hear him strongly of
opinion that an untrained man should not discuss so complex
a subject. The second lecture, on the Evolution of
Polar Clothing, was also the fruit of much work. The
general conclusion come to (and this was after the Winter
Journey) was that our own clothing and equipment could
not be bettered in any important respect, though it must
be always understood that the expedition wore wind-proof
clothing and not furs, except for hands and feet. When
man-hauling, wind-proof, I am convinced, cannot be improved
upon, but for dog-driving in cold weather I suspect
that furs may be better.</p>

<p>The table was cleared after supper and we sat round it
for these lectures three times a week. There was no compulsion
about them, and the seamen only turned up for
those which especially interested them, such as Meares'
vivid account of his journeyings on the Eastern or Chinese
borderland of Thibet. This land is inhabited by the
'Eighteen Tribes,' the original inhabitants of Thibet
who were driven out by the present inhabitants, and
Meares told us chiefly of the Lolos who killed his companion
Brook after having persuaded him that they were
friendly and anxious to help him. &quot;He had no pictures
and very makeshift maps, yet he held us really entranced
for nearly two hours by the sheer interest of his adventures.
The spirit of the wanderer is in Meares' blood: he has no
happiness but in the wild places of the earth. I have never
met so extreme a type. Even now he is looking forward to
getting away by himself to Hut Point, tired already of our
scant measure of civilization.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Three lectures a week were too many in the opinion of
the majority. The second winter with our very reduced
company we had two a week, and I feel sure that this was
an improvement. No officer nor seaman, however, could
have had too many of Ponting's lectures, which gave us
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>glimpses into many lands illustrated by his own inimitable
slides. Thus we lived every now and then for a short hour
in Burmah, India or Japan, in scenes of trees and flowers
and feminine charm which were the very antithesis of our
present situation, and we were all the better for it. Ponting
also illustrated the subjects of other lectures with home-made
slides of photographs taken during the autumn or
from printed books. But for the most part the lecturers
were perforce content with designs and plans, drawn on
paper and pinned one on the top of the other upon a large
drawing-board propped up on the table and torn off sheet
by sheet.</p>

<p>From the practical point of view the most interesting
evening to us was that on which Scott produced the Plan
of the Southern Journey. The reader may ask why this
was not really prepared until the winter previous to the
journey itself, and the answer clearly is that it was impossible
to arrange more than a rough idea until the autumn
sledging had taught its lesson in food, equipment, relative
reliability of dogs, ponies and men, and until the changes
and chances of our life showed exactly what transport
would be available for the following sledging season. Thus
it was with lively anticipation that we sat down on May 8,
an advisory committee as it were, to hear and give our
suggestions on the scheme which Scott had evolved in the
early weeks of the winter after the adventures of the Dep&ocirc;t
Journey and the loss of six ponies.</p>

<p>It was on just such a winter night, too, that Scott read
his interesting paper on the Ice Barrier and Inland Ice
which will probably form the basis for all future work on
these subjects. The Barrier, he maintained, is probably
afloat, and covers at least five times the extent of the North
Sea with an average thickness of some 400 feet, though it
has only been possible to get the very roughest of levels.
According to the movement of a dep&ocirc;t laid in the Discovery
days the Barrier moved 608 yards towards the open
Ross Sea in 13&frac12; months. It must be admitted that the inclination
of the ice-sheet is not sufficient to cause this, and
the old idea that the glacier streams flowing down from<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>
Inland Plateau provide the necessary impetus is imperfect.
It was Simpson's suggestion that &quot;the deposition
of snow on the Barrier leads to an expansion due to the
increase of weight.&quot; Some admittedly vague ideas as to
the extent and character of the inland ice-sheet ended a
clever and convincing paper which contained a lot of good
reasoning.</p>

<p>Simpson proved an excellent lecturer, and in meteorology
and in the explanation of the many instruments with which
his corner of the hut was full he possessed subjects which
interested and concerned everybody. Nelson on Biological
Problems and Taylor on Physiography were always interesting.
&quot;Taylor, I dreamt of your lecture last night. How
could I live so long in the world and not know something of
so fascinating a subject!&quot; Thus Scott on the morning following
one of these lectures.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Wright on Ice Problems, Radium,
and the Origin of Matter had highly technical subjects
which left many of us somewhat befogged. But Atkinson
on Scurvy had an audience each member of which felt that
he had a personal interest in the subject under discussion.
Indeed one of his hearers was to suffer the advanced stage
of this dread disease within six months. Atkinson inclined
to Almroth Wright's theory that scurvy is due to an acid
intoxication of the blood caused by bacteria. He described
the litmus-paper test which was practised on us monthly,
and before and after sledge journeys. In this the blood of
each individual is drawn and various strengths of dilute
sulphuric acid are added to it until it is neutralized, the
healthy man showing normal 30 to 50, while the man
with scorbutic signs will be normal 50 to 90 according to
the stage to which he has reached. The only thing which
is certain to stop scurvy is fresh vegetables: fresh meat
when life is otherwise under extreme conditions will not
do so, an instance being the Siege of Paris when they
had plenty of horse meat. In 1795 voyages were being
ruined by scurvy and Anson lost 300 out of 500 men, but
in that year the first discoveries were made and lime-juice
was introduced by Blaine. From this time scurvy prac<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>tically
disappeared from the Navy, and there was little
scurvy in Nelson's days; but the reason is not clear, since,
according to modern research, lime-juice only helps to
prevent it. It continued in the Merchant Service, and in a
decade from about 1865 some 400 cases were admitted into
the Dreadnought Hospital, whereas in the decade 1887
to 1896 there were only 38 cases. We had, at Cape Evans,
a salt of sodium to be used to alkalize the blood as an
experiment, if necessity arose. Darkness, cold, and hard
work are in Atkinson's opinion important causes of scurvy.</p>

<p>Nansen was an advocate of variety of diet as being anti-scorbutic,
and Scott recalled a story told him by Nansen
which he had never understood. It appeared that some
men had eaten tins of tainted food. Some of it was slightly
tainted, some of it was really bad. They rejected the really
bad ones, and ate those only which were slightly tainted.
&quot;And of course,&quot; said Nansen, &quot;they should have eaten
the worst.&quot;</p>

<p>I have since asked Nansen about this story. He tells me
that he must have been referring to the crew of the Windward,
the ship of the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition to
Franz Josef Land in 1894-97. The crew of this ship,
which was travelling to and from civilization, got scurvy,
though the land party kept healthy. Of this Jackson
writes: &quot;In the case of the crew of the Windward I fear
that there was considerable carelessness in the use of tinned
meats that were not free from taint, although tins quite
gone were rejected.... We [on shore] largely used
fresh bear's meat, and the crew of the Windward were also
allowed as much as they could be induced to eat. They,
however, preferred tinned meat several days a week to
a diet of bear's meat alone; and some of the crew had
such a prejudice against bear's meat as to refuse to eat it at
all.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Of course tainted food should not have been eaten at
all, but if it had to be eaten, then, according to Nansen,
the ptomaines which cause scurvy in the earlier stages of
decomposition are destroyed by the ferment which forms
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>in the later stages. They should therefore have taken the
worst tins, if any at all.</p>

<p>Wilson was strongly of opinion that fresh meat alone
would stop scurvy: on the Discovery seal meat cured it.
As to scurvy on Scott's Discovery Southern Journey, he
made light of it: however, during the Winter Journey I
remember Wilson stating that Shackleton several times
fell in a faint as he got outside the tent, and he seems to
have been seriously ill: Wilson knew that he himself had
scurvy some time before the others knew it, because the
discoloration of his gums did not show in front for some
time. He did not think their dogs on that journey had
scurvy, but ptomaine poisoning from fish which had
travelled through the tropics. He was of opinion that on
returning from sledge journeys on the Discovery they had
wrongly attributed to scurvy such symptoms as rash on the
body, swollen legs and ankles, which were rather the result
of excessive fatigue. I may add that we had these signs on
our return from the Winter Journey.</p>

<p>Then there were lectures on Geology by Debenham, on
birds and beasts and also on Sketching by Wilson, on Surveying
by Evans: but perhaps no lecture remains more
vividly in my memory than that given by Oates on what <i>we</i>
called 'The Mismanagement of Horses.' Of course to
all of us who were relying upon the ponies for the first
stage of the Southern Journey the subject was of interest as
well as utility, but the greater share of interest centred upon
the lecturer, for it was certainly supposed that taciturn
Titus could not have concealed about his person the gift of
the gab, and it was as certain as it could be that the whole
business was most distasteful to him. Imagine our delight
when he proved to have an elaborate discourse with full
notes of which no one had seen the preparation. &quot;I have
been fortunate in securing another night,&quot; he mentioned
amidst mirth, and proceeded to give us the most interesting
and able account of the minds and bodies of horses in
general and ours in particular. He ended with a story of
a dinner-party at which he was a guest, probably against his
will. A young lady was so late that the party sat down to
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>dinner without waiting longer. Soon she arrived covered
with blushes and confusion. &quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; she said,
&quot;but that horse was the limit, he ...&quot; &quot;Perhaps it was a
jibber,&quot; suggested her hostess to help her out. &quot;No, he
was a &mdash;&mdash;. I heard the cabby tell him so several times.&quot;</p>

<p>Titus Oates was the most cheerful and lovable old
pessimist that you could imagine. Often, after tethering
and feeding our ponies at a night camp on the Barrier, we
would watch the dog-teams coming up into camp. &quot;I'll
give these dogs ten days more,&quot; he would murmur in a voice
such as some people used when they heard of a British
victory. I am acquainted with so few dragoons that I do
not know their general characteristics. Few of them, I
imagine, would have gone about with the slouch which
characterized his method of locomotion, nor would many
of them have dined in a hat so shabby that it was picked
off the peg and passed round as a curiosity.</p>

<p>He came to look after the horses, and as an officer in
the Inniskillings he, no doubt, had excellent training. But
his skill went far deeper than that. There was little he
didn't know about horses, and the pity is that he did not
choose our ponies for us in Siberia: we should have had
a very different lot. In addition to his general charge of
them all, Oates took as his own pony the aforesaid devil
Christopher for the Southern Journey and for previous
training. We shall hear much more of Christopher, who
appeared to have come down to the Antarctic to initiate the
well-behaved inhabitants into all the vices of civilization,
but from beginning to end Oates' management of this
animal might have proved a model to any governor of a
lunatic asylum. His tact, patience and courage, for Christopher
was a very dangerous beast, remain some of the most
vivid recollections of a very gallant gentleman.</p>

<p>In this connection let me add that no animals could
have had more considerate and often self-sacrificing treatment
than these ponies of ours. Granted that they must be
used at all (and I do not mean to enter into that question)
they were fed, trained, and even clothed as friends and
companions rather than as beasts of burden. They were
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>never hit, a condition to which they were clearly unaccustomed.
They lived far better than they had before, and
all this was done for them in spite of the conditions under
which we ourselves lived. We became very fond of our
beasts but we could not be blind to their faults. The mind
of a horse is a very limited concern, relying almost entirely
upon memory. He rivals our politicians in that he has
little real intellect. Consequently, when the pony was faced
with conditions different from those to which he was accustomed,
he showed but little adaptability; and when you add
to this frozen harness and rugs, with all their straps and
buckles and lashings, an incredible facility for eating anything
within reach including his own tethering ropes and
the headstalls, fringes and whatnots of his companions, together
with our own scanty provisions and a general wish
to do anything except the job of the moment, it must be
admitted that the pony leader's lot was full of occasions for
bad temper. Nevertheless leaders and ponies were on the
best of terms (excepting always Christopher), which is really
not surprising when you come to think that most of the
leaders were sailors whose love of animals is profound.</p>

<p>A lean-to roof was built against the northern side of the
hut, and the ends and open side were boarded up. This
building when buttressed by the bricks of coal which
formed our fuel, and drifted up with snow by the blizzards,
formed an extremely sheltered and even warm stable. The
ponies stood in stalls with their heads towards the hut
and divided from it by a corridor; the bars which kept
them in carried also their food boxes. They lay down very
little, the ground was too cold, and Oates was of opinion
that litter would not have benefited them if we had had
space in the ship to bring it. The floor of their stall was
formed of the gravel on which the hut was built. On any
future occasion it might be worth consideration whether
a flooring of wood might add to their comfort. As you
walked down this narrow passage you passed a line of heads,
many of which would have a nip at you in the semi-darkness,
and at the far end Oates had rigged up for himself a
blubber stove, more elaborate than the one we had made
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>with the odds and ends at Hut Point, but in principle the
same, in that the fids of sealskin with the blubber attached
to them were placed on a grid, and the heat generated caused
them to drop their oil on to ashes below which formed the
fire. This fire not only warmed the stable, but melted the
snow to water the ponies and heated their bran mashes. I
do not wonder that this warm companionable home appealed
to their minds when they were exercising in the
cold, dark, windy sea-ice: they were always trying to get
rid of their leader, and if successful generally went straight
back to the hut. Here they would dodge their pursuers
until such time as they were sick of the game, when they
quietly walked into the stable of their own accord to be
welcomed with triumphant squeals and kickings by their
companions.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of their exercise. Their ration
during the winter was as follows:</p>


<ul><li>8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Chaff.</li>

<li>12 <span class="smcap">Noon</span>. Snow. Chaff and oats or oil-cake alternate days.</li>

<li>5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Snow. Hot bran mash with oil-cake, or boiled oats and chaff;</li>
<li>finally a small quantity of hay.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the spring they were got into condition on hard food all
cold, and by a carefully increased scale of exercise during
the latter part of which they drew sledges with very light
loads.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have no record as to what changes of
feeding stuffs Oates would have made if it had been possible.
Certainly we should not have brought the bales of
compressed fodder, which as I have already explained,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
was theoretically green wheat cut young, but practically
no manner of use as a food, though of some use perhaps as
bulk. Probably he would have used hay for this purpose at
Winter Quarters had our stock of it not been very limited,
for hay takes up too much room on a ship when every square
inch of stowage space is of value. The original weights of
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>fodder with which we left New Zealand were: compressed
chaff, 30 tons; hay, 5 tons; oil-cake, 5-6 tons; bran, 4-5
tons; and two kinds of oats, of which the white was better
than the black. We wanted more bran than we had.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> This
does not exhaust our list of feeding stuffs, for one of our
ponies called Snippets would eat blubber, and so far as I
know it agreed with him.</p>

<p>We left New Zealand with nineteen ponies, seventeen
of which were destined for the Main Party and two for the
help of Campbell in the exploration of King Edward VII.'s
Land. Two of these died in the big gale at sea, and we
landed fifteen ponies at Cape Evans in January. Of these
we lost six on the Dep&ocirc;t Journey, while Hackenschmidt,
who was a vicious beast, sickened and wasted away in our
absence, for no particular reason that we could discover,
until there was nothing to do but shoot him. Thus eight
only out of the original seventeen Main Party ponies which
started from New Zealand were left by the beginning of
the winter.</p>

<p>I have told<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> how, during our absence on the Dep&ocirc;t
Journey, the ship had tried to land Campbell with his
two ponies on King Edward VII.'s Land, but had been
prevented from reaching it by pack ice. Coasting back
in search of a landing place they found Amundsen in
the Bay of Whales. Under the circumstances Campbell
decided not to land his party there but to try and land on
the north coast of South Victoria Land, in which he was
finally successful. In the interval the ship returned to Cape
Evans with the news, and since he was of opinion that his
animals would be useless to him in that region he took the
opportunity to swim the two ponies ashore, a distance of
half a mile, for the ship could get no nearer and the sea-ice
had gone. Thus we started the winter with Campbell's two
ponies (Jehu and Chinaman), two ponies which had survived
the Dep&ocirc;t Journey (Nobby and James Pigg), and
six ponies which had been left at Cape Evans (Snatcher,
Snippets, Bones, Victor, Michael and Christopher) a total
of ten.<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></p>

<p>Of these ten Christopher was the only real devil with
vice, but he was a strong pony, and it was clear that he would
be useful if he could be managed. Bones, Snatcher, Victor
and Snippets were all useful ponies. Michael was a highly-strung
nice beast, but his value was doubtful; Chinaman
was more doubtful still, and it was questionable sometimes
whether Jehu would be able to pull anything at all. This
leaves Nobby and Jimmy Pigg, both of which were with
us on the Dep&ocirc;t Journey. Nobby was the best of the two;
he was the only survivor from the sea-ice disaster, and I
am not sure that his rescue did not save the situation with
regard to the Pole. Jimmy Pigg was wending his way
slowly back from Corner Camp at this time and so was also
saved. He was a weak pony but did extremely well on the
Polar Journey. It may be coincidence that these two ponies,
the only ponies which had gained previous sledging experience,
did better according to their strength than any of
the others, but I am inclined to believe that their familiarity
with the conditions on the Barrier was of great value to
them, doing away with much useless worry and exhaustion.</p>

<p>And so it will be understood with what feelings of
anxiety any cases of injury or illness to our ponies were
regarded. The cases of injury were few and of small importance,
thanks to the care with which they were exercised
in the dark on ice which was by no means free from inequalities.
Let me explain in passing that this ice is almost
always covered by at least a thin layer of drifted snow and
for the most part is not slippery. Every now and then there
would be a great banging and crashing heard through the
walls of the hut in the middle of the night. The watchman
would run out, Oates put on his boots, Scott be audibly
uneasy. It was generally Bones or Chinaman kicking their
stalls, perhaps to keep themselves warm, but by the time
the watchman had reached the stable he would be met by
a line of sleepy faces blinking at him in the light of the
electric torch, each saying plainly that he could not possibly
have been responsible for a breach of the peace!</p>

<p>But antics might easily lead to accidents, and more
than once a pony was found twisted up in some way
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>in his stall, or even to have fallen to the ground. Their
heads were tied on either side to the stanchions of the stall,
and so if they tried to lie down complications might arise.
More alarming was the one serious case of illness, preceded
by a slighter case of a similar nature in another pony.
Jimmy Pigg had a slight attack of colic in the middle of
June, but he was feeding all right again during the evening
of the same day. It was at noon, July 14, that Bones went
off his feed. This was followed by spasms of acute pain.
&quot;Every now and again he attempted to lie down, and
Oates eventually thought it was wiser to allow him to do
so. Once down, his head gradually drooped until he lay at
length, every now and then twitching very horribly with
the pain, and from time to time raising his head and even
scrambling to his legs when it grew intense. I don't think
I ever realized before how pathetic a horse could be under
such conditions; no sound escapes him, his misery can
only be indicated by those distressing spasms and by dumb
movement of the head with a patient expression always
suggestive of appeal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Towards midnight it seemed
that we were to lose him, and, apart from other considerations,
we knew that unless we could keep all the surviving
animals alive the risks of failure in the coming journey
were much increased.</p>

<p>&quot;It was shortly after midnight when I [Scott] was told
that the animal seemed a little easier. At 2.30 I was again
in the stable and found the improvement had been maintained;
the horse still lay on its side with outstretched
head, but the spasms had ceased, its eye looked less distressed,
and its ears pricked to occasional noises. As I
stood looking it suddenly raised its head and rose without
effort to its legs; then in a moment, as though some bad
dream had passed, it began to nose at some hay and at its
neighbour. Within three minutes it had drunk a bucket
of water and had started to feed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The immediate cause of the trouble was indicated by
&quot;a small ball of semi-fermented hay covered with mucus
and containing tape-worms; so far not very serious, but
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>unfortunately attached to this mass was a strip of the lining
of the intestine.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The recovery of Bones was uninterrupted. Two day
later another pony went off his feed and lay down, but was
soon well again.</p>

<p>Considerable speculation as to the original cause of this
illness never found a satisfactory answer. Some traced it to
a want of ventilation, and it is necessary to say that both
the ponies who were ill stood next to the blubber stove;
at any rate a big ventilator was fitted and more fresh air
let in. Others traced it to the want of water, supposing that
the animals would not eat as much snow as they would have
drunk water; the easy remedy for this was to give them
water instead of snow. We also gave them more salt than
they had had before. Whatever the cause may have been
we had no more of this colic, and the improvement in their
condition until we started sledging was uninterrupted.</p>

<p>All the ponies were treated for worms; it was also found
that they had lice, which were eradicated after some time
and difficulty by a wash of tobacco and water. I know that
Oates wished that he had clipped the ponies at the beginning
of the winter, believing that they would have grown
far better coats if this had been done. He also would have
wished for a loose box for each pony.</p>

<p>No account of the ponies would be complete without
mention of our Russian pony boy, Anton. He was small
in height, but he was exceedingly strong and had a chest
measurement of 40 inches.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-30.jpg"><img src="./images/1-30_th.jpg" alt="Erebus And Lands End" title="Erebus And Lands End" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Erebus And Lands End</span></p>
<hr />


<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-31.jpg"><img src="./images/1-31_th.jpg" alt="Erebus Behind Great Razorback" title="Erebus Behind Great Razorback" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Erebus Behind Great Razorback</span></p>
<hr />


<p>I believe both Anton and Dimitri, the Russian dog
driver, were brought originally to look after the ponies and
dogs on their way from Siberia to New Zealand. But they
proved such good fellows and so useful that we were very
glad to take them on the strength of the landing party.
I fear that Anton, at any rate, did not realize what he was
in for. When we arrived at Cape Crozier in the ship on
our voyage south, and he saw the two great peaks of Ross
Island in front and the Barrier Cliff disappearing in an
unbroken wall below the eastern horizon, he imagined that
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>he reached the South Pole, and was suitably elated.
When the darkness of the winter closed down upon us,
this apparently unnatural order of things so preyed upon
his superstitious mind that he became seriously alarmed.
Where the sea-ice joined the land in front of the hut was
of course a working crack, caused by the rise and fall of
the tide. Sometimes the sea-water found its way up, and
Anton was convinced that the weird phosphorescent lights
which danced up out of the sea were devils. In propitiation
we found that he had sacrificed to them his most cherished
luxury, his scanty allowance of cigarettes, which he
had literally cast upon the waters in the darkness. It was
natural that his thoughts should turn to the comforts of
his Siberian home, and the one-legged wife whom he was
going to marry there, and when it became clear that a
another year would be spent in the South his mind was
troubled. And so he went to Oates and asked him, &quot;If I
go away at the end of this year, will Captain Scott disinherit
me?&quot; In order to try and express his idea, for he knew
little English, he had some days before been asking &quot;what
we called it when a father died and left his son nothing.&quot;
Poor Anton!</p>

<p>He looked long and anxiously for the ship, and with his
kit-bag on his shoulder was amongst the first to trek across
the ice to meet her. Having asked for and obtained a job
of work there was no happier man on board: he never left
her until she reached New Zealand. Nevertheless he was
always cheerful, always working, and a most useful addition
to our small community.</p>

<p>It is still usual to talk of people living in complete
married happiness when we really mean, so Mr. Bernard
Shaw tells me, that they confine their quarrels to Thursday
nights. If then I say that we lived this life for nearly three
years, from the day when we left England until the day we
returned to New Zealand, without any friction of any kind,
I shall be supposed to be making a formal statement of
somewhat limited truth. May I say that there is really no
formality about it, and nothing but the truth. To be absolutely
accurate I must admit to having seen a man in a
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>very 'prickly' state on one occasion. That was all. It
didn't last and may have been well justified for aught I
know: I have forgotten what it was all about. Why we
should have been more fortunate than polar travellers in
general it is hard to say, but undoubtedly a very powerful
reason was that we had no idle hours: there was no time
to quarrel.</p>

<p>Before we went South people were always saying, &quot;You
will get fed up with one another. What will you do all the
dark winter?&quot; As a matter of fact the difficulty was to get
through with the work. Often after working all through
a long night-watch officers carried on as a matter of course
through the following day in order to clear off arrears.
There was little reading or general relaxation during the
day: certainly not before supper, if at all. And while
no fixed hours for work were laid down, the custom was
general that all hours between breakfast and supper should
be so used.</p>

<p>Our small company was desperately keen to obtain
results. The youngest and most cynical pessimist must
have had cause for wonder to see a body of healthy and not
unintellectual men striving thus single-mindedly to add
their small quota of scientific and geographical knowledge
to the sum total of the world&mdash;with no immediate prospect
of its practical utility. Laymen and scientists alike were
determined to attain the objects to gain which they had set
forth.</p>

<p>And I believe that in a vague intangible way there was
an ideal in front of and behind this work. It is really not
desirable for men who do not believe that knowledge is of
value for its own sake to take up this kind of life. The
question constantly put to us in civilization was and still
is: &quot;What is the use? Is there gold? or Is there coal?&quot;
The commercial spirit of the present day can see no good
in pure science: the English manufacturer is not interested
in research which will not give him a financial return within
one year: the city man sees in it only so much energy
wasted on unproductive work: truly they are bound to the
wheel of conventional life.<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></p>

<p>Now unless a man believes that such a view is wrong he
has no business to be 'down South.' Our magnetic and
meteorological work may, I suppose, have a fairly immediate
bearing upon commerce and shipping: otherwise
I cannot imagine any branch of our labours which will do
more at present than swell the central pool of unapplied
knowledge. The members of this expedition believed that
it was worth while to discover new land and new life, to
reach the Southern Pole of the earth, to make elaborate
meteorological and magnetic observations and extended
geological surveys with all the other branches of research
for which we were equipped. They were prepared to suffer
great hardship; and some of them died for their beliefs.
Without such ideals the spirit which certainly existed in
our small community would have been impossible.</p>

<p>But if the reasons for this happy state of our domestic
life were due largely to the adaptability and keenness of the
members of our small community, I doubt whether the
frictions which have caused other expeditions to be less
comfortable than they might have been, would have been
avoided in our case, had it not been for the qualities in
some of our men which set a fashion of hard work without
any thought of personal gain.</p>

<p>With all its troubles it is a good life. We came back
from the Barrier, telling one another we loathed the place
and nothing on earth should make us return. But now the
Barrier comes back to us, with its clean, open life, and the
smell of the cooker, and its soft sound sleep. So much of
the trouble of this world is caused by memories, for we
only remember half.</p>

<p>We have forgotten&mdash;or nearly forgotten&mdash;how the loss
of a biscuit crumb left a sense of injury which lasted for
a week; how the greatest friends were so much on one
another's nerves that they did not speak for days for fear of
quarrelling; how angry we felt when the cook ran short
on the weekly bag; how sick we were after the first meals
when we could eat as much as we liked; how anxious we
were when a man fell ill many hundreds of miles from
home, and we had a fortnight of thick weather and had to
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>find our dep&ocirc;ts or starve. We remember the cry of <i>Camp
Ho!</i> which preceded the cup of tea which gave us five
more miles that evening; the good fellowship which completed
our supper after safely crossing a bad patch of
crevasses; the square inch of plum pudding which celebrated
our Christmas Day; the chanties we sang all over
the Barrier as we marched our ponies along.</p>

<p>We travelled for Science. Those three small embryos
from Cape Crozier, that weight of fossils from Buckley
Island, and that mass of material, less spectacular, but
gathered just as carefully hour by hour in wind and drift,
darkness and cold, were striven for in order that the world
may have a little more knowledge, that it may build on
what it knows instead of on what it thinks.</p>

<p>Some of our men were ambitious: some wanted money,
others a name; some a help up the scientific ladder, others
an F.R.S. Why not? But we had men who did not care
a rap for money or fame. I do not believe it mattered to
Wilson when he found that Amundsen had reached the
Pole a few days before him&mdash;not much. Pennell would
have been very bored if you had given him a knighthood.
Lillie, Bowers, Priestley, Debenham, Atkinson and many
others were much the same.</p>

<p>But there is no love lost between the class of men who
go out and do such work and the authorities at home who
deal with their collections. I remember a conversation in
the hut during the last bad winter. Men were arguing
fiercely that professionally they lost a lot by being down
South, that they fell behindhand in current work, got out
of the running and so forth. There is a lot in that. And
then the talk went on to the publication of results, and
the way in which they would wish them done. A said he
wasn't going to hand over his work to be mucked up by
such and such a body at home; B said he wasn't going
to have his buried in museum book-shelves never to be
seen again; C said he would jolly well publish his own
results in the scientific journals. And the ears of the armchair
scientists who might deal with our hard-won specimens
and observations should have been warm that night.<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></p>

<p>At the time I felt a little indignant. It seemed to me
that these men ought to think themselves lucky to be
down South at all: there were thousands who would have
like to take their place. But now I understand quite a lot
more than I did then. Science is a big thing if you can
travel a Winter Journey in her cause and not regret it. I
am not sure she is not bigger still if you can have dealings
with scientists and continue to follow in her path.</p>

is the appeal it makes to our imagination, as one of the most gallant stories

new; that they should have persisted in this effort in spite of every

<p>The 'Lamp box' mentioned above contained the following:</p>


<ul><li>1 Lamp for burning blubber.</li>
<li>1 Lamp for burning spirit.</li>
<li>1 Tent candle lamp.</li>
<li>1 Blubber cooker.</li>
<li>1 Blowpipe.</li></ul>



<p>The party of three men set out with a total weight of
757 lbs. to draw, the ski and sticks in the above list being
left behind at the last moment.</p>

<p>It was impossible to load the total bulk upon one 12-ft.
sledge, and so two 9-ft. sledges were taken, one toggled on
behind the other. While this made the packing and handling
of the gear much easier, it nearly doubled the friction
surface against which the party had to pull.</p>

<p class="right"><i>June 22. Midwinter Night.</i></p>

<p>A hard night: clear, with a blue sky so deep that it
looks black: the stars are steel points: the glaciers burnished
silver. The snow rings and thuds to your footfall.<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>
The ice is cracking to the falling temperature and the tide
crack groans as the water rises. And over all, wave upon
wave, fold upon fold, there hangs the curtain of the aurora.
As you watch, it fades away, and then quite suddenly a
great beam flashes up and rushes to the zenith, an arch of
palest green and orange, a tail of flaming gold. Again it
falls, fading away into great searchlight beams which rise
behind the smoking crater of Mount Erebus. And again
the spiritual veil is drawn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Here at the roaring loom of Time I ply<br /></span>
<span>And weave for God the garment thou seest him by.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Inside the hut are orgies. We are very merry&mdash;and
indeed why not? The sun turns to come back to us to-night,
and such a day comes only once a year.</p>

<p>After dinner we had to make speeches, but instead of
making a speech Bowers brought in a wonderful Christmas
tree, made of split bamboos and a ski stick, with feathers
tied to the end of each branch; candles, sweets, preserved
fruits, and the most absurd toys of which Bill was
the owner. Titus got three things which pleased him immensely,
a sponge, a whistle, and a pop-gun which went
off when he pressed in the butt. For the rest of the evening
he went round asking whether you were sweating. &quot;No.&quot;
&quot;Yes, you are,&quot; he said, and wiped your face with the
sponge. &quot;If you want to please me very much you will
fall down when I shoot you,&quot; he said to me, and then he
went round shooting everybody. At intervals he blew the
whistle.</p>

<p>He danced the Lancers with Anton, and Anton, whose
dancing puts that of the Russian Ballet into the shade, continually
apologized for not being able to do it well enough.
Ponting gave a great lecture with slides which he had made
since we arrived, many of which Meares had coloured.
When one of these came up one of us would shout, &quot;Who
coloured that,&quot; and another would cry, &quot;Meares,&quot;&mdash;then
uproar. It was impossible for Ponting to speak. We had
a milk punch, when Scott proposed the Eastern Party, and
Clissold, the cook, proposed Good Old True Milk. Titus
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>blew away the ball of his gun. &quot;I blew it into the cerulean&mdash;how
doth Homer have it?&mdash;cerulean azure&mdash;hence
Erebus.&quot; As we turned in he said, &quot;Cherry, are you
responsible for your actions?&quot; and when I said Yes, he
blew loudly on his whistle, and the last thing I remembered
was that he woke up Meares to ask him whether he
was fancy free.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent bust.</p>

<hr />

<p>Five days later and three men, one of whom at any rate
is feeling a little frightened, stand panting and sweating
out in McMurdo Sound. They have two sledges, one tied
behind the other, and these sledges are piled high with
sleeping-bags and camping equipment, six weeks' provisions,
and a venesta case full of scientific gear for pickling
and preserving. In addition there is a pickaxe, ice-axes,
an Alpine rope, a large piece of green Willesden
canvas and a bit of board. Scott's amazed remark when he
saw our sledges two hours ago, &quot;Bill, why are you taking
all this oil?&quot; pointing to the six cans lashed to the tray on
the second sledge, had a bite in it. Our weights for such
travelling are enormous&mdash;253 lbs. a man.</p>

<p>It is mid-day but it is pitchy dark, and it is not warm.</p>

<p>As we rested my mind went back to a dusty, dingy
office in Victoria Street some fifteen months ago. &quot;I want
you to come,&quot; said Wilson to me, and then, &quot;I want to go
to Cape Crozier in the winter and work out the embryology
of the Emperor penguins, but I'm not saying much
about it&mdash;it might never come off.&quot; Well! this was
better than Victoria Street, where the doctors had nearly
refused to let me go because I could only see the people
across the road as vague blobs walking. Then Bill went
and had a talk with Scott about it, and they said I might
come if I was prepared to take the additional risk. At
that time I would have taken anything.</p>

<p>After the Dep&ocirc;t Journey, at Hut Point, walking over
that beastly, slippery, sloping ice-foot which I always
imagined would leave me some day in the sea, Bill asked
me whether I would go with him&mdash;and who else for a
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>third? There can have been little doubt whom we both
wanted, and that evening Bowers had been asked. Of
course he was mad to come. And here we were. &quot;This
winter travel is a new and bold venture,&quot; wrote Scott in
the hut that night, &quot;but the right men have gone to
attempt it.&quot;</p>

<p>I don't know. There never could have been any doubt
about Bill and Birdie. Probably Lashly would have made
the best third, but Bill had a prejudice against seamen for
a journey like this&mdash;&quot;They don't take enough care of
themselves, and they <i>will</i> not look after their clothes.&quot;
But Lashly was wonderful&mdash;if Scott had only taken a four-man
party and Lashly to the Pole!</p>

<p>What is this venture? Why is the embryo of the
Emperor penguin so important to Science? And why
should three sane and common-sense explorers be sledging
away on a winter's night to a Cape which has only been
visited before in daylight, and then with very great difficulty?</p>

<p>I have explained more fully in the Introduction to this
book<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> the knowledge the world possessed at this time of
the Emperor penguin, mainly due to Wilson. But it is
because the Emperor is probably the most primitive bird
in existence that the working out of his embryology is so
important. The embryo shows remains of the development
of an animal in former ages and former states; it recapitulates
its former lives. The embryo of an Emperor
may prove the missing link between birds and the reptiles
from which birds have sprung.</p>

<p>Only one rookery of Emperor penguins had been
found at this date, and this was on the sea-ice inside a
little bay of the Barrier edge at Cape Crozier, which was
guarded by miles of some of the biggest pressure in the
Antarctic. Chicks had been found in September, and
Wilson reckoned that the eggs must be laid in the beginning
of July. And so we started just after midwinter on
the weirdest bird's-nesting expedition that has ever been or
ever will be.</p>

<hr />



<p><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></p>
<p>But the sweat was freezing in our clothing and we
moved on. All we could see was a black patch away to our
left which was Turk's Head: when this disappeared we
knew that we had passed Glacier Tongue which, unseen
by us, eclipsed the rocks behind. And then we camped for
lunch.</p>

<p>That first camp only lives in my memory because it
began our education of camp work in the dark. Had we
now struck the blighting temperature which we were to
meet....</p>

<p>There was just enough wind to make us want to hurry:
down harness, each man to a strap on the sledge&mdash;quick
with the floor-cloth&mdash;the bags to hold it down&mdash;now a
good spread with the bamboos and the tent inner lining&mdash;hold
them, Cherry, and over with the outer covering&mdash;snow
on to the skirting and inside with the cook with his
candle and a box of matches....</p>

<p>That is how we tied it: that is the way we were accustomed
to do it, day after day and night after night when
the sun was still high or at any rate only setting, sledging
on the Barrier in spring and summer and autumn; pulling
our hands from our mitts when necessary&mdash;plenty of
time to warm up afterwards; in the days when we took
pride in getting our tea boiling within twenty minutes of
throwing off our harness: when the man who wanted to
work in his fur mitts was thought a bit too slow.</p>

<p>But now it <i>didn't</i> work. &quot;We shall have to go a bit
slower,&quot; said Bill, and &quot;we shall get more used to working
in the dark.&quot; At this time, I remember, I was still trying
to wear spectacles.</p>

<p>We spent that night on the sea-ice, finding that we were
too far in towards Castle Rock; and it was not until the
following afternoon that we reached and lunched at Hut
Point. I speak of day and night, though they were much
the same, and later on when we found that we could not
get the work into a twenty-four-hour day, we decided to
carry on as though such a convention did not exist; as in
actual fact it did not. We had already realized that cooking
under these conditions would be a bad job, and that the
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>usual arrangement by which one man was cook for the
week would be intolerable. We settled to be cook alternately
day by day. For food we brought only pemmican
and biscuit and butter; for drink we had tea, and we drank
hot water to turn in on.</p>

<p>Pulling out from Hut Point that evening we brought
along our heavy loads on the two nine-foot sledges with
comparative ease; it was the first, and though we did not
know it then, the only bit of good pulling we were to have.
Good pulling to the sledge traveller means easy pulling.
Away we went round Cape Armitage and eastwards. We
knew that the Barrier edge was in front of us and also that
the break-up of the sea-ice had left the face of it as a low
perpendicular cliff. We had therefore to find a place where
the snow had formed a drift. This we came right up
against and met quite suddenly a very keen wind flowing,
as it always does, from the cold Barrier down to the comparatively
warm sea-ice. The temperature was -47&deg; F.,
and I was a fool to take my hands out of my mitts to haul
on the ropes to bring the sledges up. I started away from
the Barrier edge with all ten fingers frost-bitten. They did
not really come back until we were in the tent for our night
meal, and within a few hours there were two or three large
blisters, up to an inch long, on all of them. For many days
those blisters hurt frightfully.</p>

<p>We were camped that night about half a mile in from
the Barrier edge. The temperature was -56&deg;. We had a
baddish time, being very glad to get out of our shivering
bags next morning (June 29). We began to suspect, as we
knew only too well later, that the only good time of the
twenty-four hours was breakfast, for then with reasonable
luck we need not get into our sleeping-bags again for
another seventeen hours.</p>

<p>The horror of the nineteen days it took us to travel
from Cape Evans to Cape Crozier would have to be re-experienced
to be appreciated; and any one would be a
fool who went again: it is not possible to describe it. The
weeks which followed them were comparative bliss, not
because later our conditions were better&mdash;they were far
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>worse&mdash;because we were callous. I for one had come
to that point of suffering at which I did not really care if
only I could die without much pain. They talk of the
heroism of the dying&mdash;they little know&mdash;it would be so
easy to die, a dose of morphia, a friendly crevasse, and
blissful sleep. The trouble is to go on....</p>

<p>It was the darkness that did it. I don't believe minus
seventy temperatures would be bad in daylight, not comparatively
bad, when you could see where you were going,
where you were stepping, where the sledge straps were,
the cooker, the primus, the food; could see your footsteps
lately trodden deep into the soft snow that you might find
your way back to the rest of your load; could see the lashings
of the food bags; could read a compass without striking
three or four different boxes to find one dry match;
could read your watch to see if the blissful moment of
getting out of your bag was come without groping in the
snow all about; when it would not take you five minutes
to lash up the door of the tent, and five hours to get
started in the morning....</p>

<p>But in these days we were never less than four hours
from the moment when Bill cried &quot;Time to get up&quot; to
the time when we got into our harness. It took two men
to get one man into his harness, and was all they could
do, for the canvas was frozen and our clothes were frozen
until sometimes not even two men could bend them into
the required shape.</p>

<p>The trouble is sweat and breath. I never knew before
how much of the body's waste comes out through the
pores of the skin. On the most bitter days, when we had
to camp before we had done a four-hour march in order to
nurse back our frozen feet, it seemed that we must be
sweating. And all this sweat, instead of passing away
through the porous wool of our clothing and gradually
drying off us, froze and accumulated. It passed just away
from our flesh and then became ice: we shook plenty of
snow and ice down from inside our trousers every time we
changed our foot-gear, and we could have shaken it from
our vests and from between our vests and shirts, but of
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>course we could not strip to this extent. But when we got
into our sleeping-bags, if we were fortunate, we became
warm enough during the night to thaw this ice: part
remained in our clothes, part passed into the skins of
our sleeping-bags, and soon both were sheets of armour-plate.</p>

<p>As for our breath&mdash;in the daytime it did nothing worse
than cover the lower parts of our faces with ice and solder
our balaclavas tightly to our heads. It was no good trying
to get your balaclava off until you had had the primus
going quite a long time, and then you could throw your
breath about if you wished. The trouble really began in
your sleeping-bag, for it was far too cold to keep a hole
open through which to breathe. So all night long our
breath froze into the skins, and our respiration became
quicker and quicker as the air in our bags got fouler and
fouler: it was never possible to make a match strike or
burn inside our bags!</p>

<p>Of course we were not iced up all at once: it took
several days of this kind of thing before we really got into
big difficulties on this score. It was not until I got out of
the tent one morning fully ready to pack the sledge that I
realized the possibilities ahead. We had had our breakfast,
struggled into our foot-gear, and squared up inside the tent,
which was comparatively warm. Once outside, I raised my
head to look round and found I could not move it back.
My clothing had frozen hard as I stood&mdash;perhaps fifteen
seconds. For four hours I had to pull with my head stuck
up, and from that time we all took care to bend down into
a pulling position before being frozen in.</p>

<p>By now we had realized that we must reverse the usual
sledging routine and do everything slowly, wearing when
possible the fur mitts which fitted over our woollen mitts,
and always stopping whatever we were doing, directly we
felt that any part of us was getting frozen, until the circulation
was restored. Henceforward it was common for one
or other of us to leave the other two to continue the camp
work while he stamped about in the snow, beat his arms,
or nursed some exposed part. But we could not restore the
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>circulation of our feet like this&mdash;the only way then was to
camp and get some hot water into ourselves before we took
our foot-gear off. The difficulty was to know whether our
feet were frozen or not, for the only thing we knew for
certain was that we had lost all feeling in them. Wilson's
knowledge as a doctor came in here: many a time he had
to decide from our descriptions of our feet whether to camp
or to go on for another hour. A wrong decision meant
disaster, for if one of us had been crippled the whole party
would have been placed in great difficulties. Probably we
should all have died.</p>

<p>On June 29 the temperature was -50&deg; all day and there
was sometimes a light breeze which was inclined to frost-bite
our faces and hands. Owing to the weight of our two
sledges and the bad surface our pace was not more than
a slow and very heavy plod: at our lunch camp Wilson
had the heel and sole of one foot frost-bitten, and I had
two big toes. Bowers was never worried by frost-bitten
feet.</p>

<p>That night was very cold, the temperature falling to
-66&deg;, and it was -55&deg; at breakfast on June 30. We had
not shipped the eider-down linings to our sleeping-bags, in
order to keep them dry as long as possible. My own fur
bag was too big for me, and throughout this journey was
more difficult to thaw out than the other two: on the other
hand, it never split, as did Bill's.</p>

<p>We were now getting into that cold bay which lies between
the Hut Point Peninsula and Terror Point. It was
known from old Discovery days that the Barrier winds
are deflected from this area, pouring out into McMurdo
Sound behind us, and into the Ross Sea at Cape Crozier in
front. In consequence of the lack of high winds the surface
of the snow is never swept and hardened and polished as
elsewhere: it was now a mass of the hardest and smallest
snow crystals, to pull through which in cold temperatures
was just like pulling through sand. I have spoken elsewhere
of Barrier surfaces, and how, when the cold is very
great, sledge runners cannot melt the crystal points but
only advance by rolling them over and over upon one
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>another. That was the surface we met on this journey, and
in soft snow the effect is accentuated. Our feet were sinking
deep at every step.</p>

<p>And so when we tried to start on June 30 we found we
could not move both sledges together. There was nothing
for it but to take one on at a time and come back for the
other. This has often been done in daylight when the only
risks run are those of blizzards which may spring up suddenly
and obliterate tracks. Now in darkness it was more
complicated. From 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> there was enough
light to see the big holes made by our feet, and we took
on one sledge, trudged back in our tracks, and brought on
the second. Bowers used to toggle and untoggle our harnesses
when we changed sledges. Of course in this relay
work we covered three miles in distance for every one mile
forward, and even the single sledges were very hard pulling.
When we lunched the temperature was -61&deg;. After
lunch the little light had gone, and we carried a naked
lighted candle back with us when we went to find our
second sledge. It was the weirdest kind of procession,
three frozen men and a little pool of light. Generally we
steered by Jupiter, and I never see him now without recalling
his friendship in those days.</p>

<p>We were very silent, it was not very easy to talk: but
sledging is always a silent business. I remember a long discussion
which began just now about cold snaps&mdash;was this
the normal condition of the Barrier, or was it a cold snap?&mdash;what
constituted a cold snap? The discussion lasted
about a week. Do things slowly, always slowly, that was
the burden of Wilson's leadership: and every now and
then the question, Shall we go on? and the answer Yes.
&quot;I think we are all right as long as our appetites are
good,&quot; said Bill. Always patient, self-possessed, unruffled,
he was the only man on earth, as I believe, who could have
led this journey.</p>

<p>That day we made 3&frac14; miles, and travelled 10 miles
to do it. The temperature was -66&deg; when we camped,
and we were already pretty badly iced up. That was the
last night I lay (I had written slept) in my big rein<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>deer
bag without the lining of eider-down which we each
carried. For me it was a very bad night: a succession
of shivering fits which I was quite unable to stop, and
which took possession of my body for many minutes at
a time until I thought my back would break, such was
the strain placed upon it. They talk of chattering teeth:
but when your body chatters you may call yourself cold. I
can only compare the strain to that which I have been unfortunate
enough to see in a case of lock-jaw. One of my
big toes was frost-bitten, but I do not know for how long.
Wilson was fairly comfortable in his smaller bag, and
Bowers was snoring loudly. The minimum temperature
that night as taken under the sledge was -69&deg;; and as
taken on the sledge was -75&deg;. That is a hundred and
seven degrees of frost.</p>

<p>We did the same relay work on July 1, but found the
pulling still harder; and it was all that we could do to move
the one sledge forward. From now onwards Wilson and
I, but not to the same extent Bowers, experienced a curious
optical delusion when returning in our tracks for the second
sledge. I have said that we found our way back by the
light of a candle, and we found it necessary to go back in
our same footprints. These holes became to our tired brains
not depressions but elevations: hummocks over which we
stepped, raising our feet painfully and draggingly. And
then we remembered, and said what fools we were, and
for a while we compelled ourselves to walk through these
phantom hills. But it was no lasting good, and as the days
passed we realized that we must suffer this absurdity, for
we could not do anything else. But of course it took it out
of us.</p>

<p>During these days the blisters on my fingers were very
painful. Long before my hands were frost-bitten, or indeed
anything but cold, which was of course a normal thing, the
matter inside these big blisters, which rose all down my
fingers with only a skin between them, was frozen into ice.
To handle the cooking gear or the food bags was agony;
to start the primus was worse; and when, one day, I was
able to prick six or seven of the blisters after supper and
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>let the liquid matter out, the relief was very great. Every
night after that I treated such others as were ready in the
same way until they gradually disappeared. Sometimes it
was difficult not to howl.</p>

<p>I <i>did</i> want to howl many times every hour of these days
and nights, but I invented a formula instead, which I repeated
to myself continually. Especially, I remember, it
came in useful when at the end of the march with my feet
frost-bitten, my heart beating slowly, my vitality at its
lowest ebb, my body solid with cold, I used to seize the
shovel and go on digging snow on to the tent skirting
while the cook inside was trying to light the primus.
&quot;You've got it in the neck&mdash;stick it&mdash;stick it&mdash;you've got
it in the neck,&quot; was the refrain, and I wanted every little
bit of encouragement it would give me: then I would find
myself repeating &quot;Stick it&mdash;stick it&mdash;stick it&mdash;stick it,&quot;
and then &quot;You've got it in the neck.&quot; One of the joys
of summer sledging is that you can let your mind wander
thousands of miles away for weeks and weeks. Oates used
to provision his little yacht (there was a pickled herring he
was going to have): I invented the compactest little revolving
bookcase which was going to hold not books, but
pemmican and chocolate and biscuit and cocoa and sugar,
and have a cooker on the top, and was going to stand
always ready to quench my hunger when I got home: and
we visited restaurants and theatres and grouse moors, and
we thought of a pretty girl, or girls, and.... But now
that was all impossible. Our conditions forced themselves
upon us without pause: it was not possible to think of
anything else. We got no respite. I found it best to refuse
to let myself think of the past or the future&mdash;to live only
for the job of the moment, and to compel myself to think
only how to do it most efficiently. Once you let yourself
imagine....</p>

<p>This day also (July 1) we were harassed by a nasty
little wind which blew in our faces. The temperature was
-66&deg;, and in such temperatures the effect of even the
lightest airs is blighting, and immediately freezes any exposed
part. But we all fitted the bits of wind-proof lined
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>with fur which we had made in the hut, across our balaclavas
in front of our noses, and these were of the greatest
comfort. They formed other places upon which our breath
could freeze, and the lower parts of our faces were soon
covered with solid sheets of ice, which was in itself an
additional protection. This was a normal and not uncomfortable
condition during the journey: the hair on our
faces kept the ice away from the skin, and for myself I
would rather have the ice than be without it, until I want
to get my balaclava off to drink my hoosh. We only made
2&frac14; miles, and it took 8 hours.</p>

<p>It blew force 3 that night with a temperature of -65.2&deg;,
and there was some drift. This was pretty bad, but luckily
the wind dropped to a light breeze by the time we were
ready to start the next morning (July 2). The temperature
was then -60&deg;, and continued so all day, falling lower
in the evening. At 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we watched a bank of fog form
over the peninsula to our left and noticed at the same
time that our frozen mitts thawed out on our hands, and
the outlines of the land as shown by the stars became obscured.
We made 2&frac12; miles with the usual relaying, and
camped at 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> with the temperature -65&deg;. It really
was a terrible march, and parts of both my feet were frozen
at lunch. After supper I pricked six or seven of the worst
blisters, and the relief was considerable.</p>

<p>I have met with amusement people who say, &quot;Oh, we
had minus fifty temperatures in Canada; they didn't
worry <i>me</i>,&quot; or &quot;I've been down to minus sixty something
in Siberia.&quot; And then you find that they had nice dry
clothing, a nice night's sleep in a nice aired bed, and had
just walked out after lunch for a few minutes from a nice
warm hut or an overheated train. And they look back
upon it as an experience to be remembered. Well! of
course as an experience of cold this can only be compared
to eating a vanilla ice with hot chocolate cream after an
excellent dinner at Claridge's. But in our present state
we began to look upon minus fifties as a luxury which we
did not often get.</p>

<p>That evening, for the first time, we discarded our naked
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>candle in favour of the rising moon. We had started before
the moon on purpose, but as we shall see she gave us little
light. However, we owed our escape from a very sticky
death to her on one occasion.</p>

<p>It was a little later on when we were among crevasses,
with Terror above us, but invisible, somewhere on our left,
and the Barrier pressure on our right. We were quite lost
in the darkness, and only knew that we were running
downhill, the sledge almost catching our heels. There had
been no light all day, clouds obscured the moon, we had
not seen her since yesterday. And quite suddenly a little
patch of clear sky drifted, as it were, over her face, and she
showed us three paces ahead a great crevasse with just a
shining icy lid not much thicker than glass. We should
all have walked into it, and the sledge would certainly have
followed us down. After that I felt we had a chance of
pulling through: God could not be so cruel as to have
saved us just to prolong our agony.</p>

<p>But at present we need not worry about crevasses; for
we had not reached the long stretch where the moving
Barrier, with the weight of many hundred miles of ice
behind it, comes butting up against the slopes of Mount
Terror, itself some eleven thousand feet high. Now we
were still plunging ankle-deep in the mass of soft sandy
snow which lies in the windless area. It seemed to have no
bottom at all, and since the snow was much the same temperature
as the air, our feet, as well as our bodies, got colder
and colder the longer we marched: in ordinary sledging
you begin to warm up after a quarter of an hour's pulling,
here it was just the reverse. Even now I find myself unconsciously
kicking the toes of my right foot against the
heel of my left: a habit I picked up on this journey by doing
it every time we halted. Well no. Not always. For there
was one halt when we just lay on our backs and gazed up
into the sky, where, so the others said, there was blazing
the most wonderful aurora they had ever seen. I did not
see it, being so near-sighted and unable to wear spectacles
owing to the cold. The aurora was always before us as
we travelled east, more beautiful than any seen by previous
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>expeditions wintering in McMurdo Sound, where Erebus
must have hidden the most brilliant displays. Now most
of the sky was covered with swinging, swaying curtains
which met in a great whirl overhead: lemon yellow, green
and orange.</p>

<p>The minimum this night was -65&deg;, and during July 3
it ranged between -52&deg; and -58&deg;. We got forward
only 2&frac12; miles, and by this time I had silently made up my
mind that we had not the ghost of a chance of reaching the
penguins. I am sure that Bill was having a very bad time
these nights, though it was an impression rather than anything
else, for he never said so. We knew we did sleep,
for we heard one another snore, and also we used to have
dreams and nightmares; but we had little consciousness of
it, and we were now beginning to drop off when we halted
on the march.</p>

<p>Our sleeping-bags were getting really bad by now, and
already it took a long time to thaw a way down into them
at night. Bill spread his in the middle, Bowers was on
his right, and I was on his left. Always he insisted that I
should start getting my legs into mine before <i>he</i> started:
we were rapidly cooling down after our hot supper, and
this was very unselfish of him. Then came seven shivering
hours and first thing on getting out of our sleeping-bags
in the morning we stuffed our personal gear into the mouth
of the bag before it could freeze: this made a plug which
when removed formed a frozen hole for us to push into as
a start in the evening.</p>

<p>We got into some strange knots when trying to persuade
our limbs into our bags, and suffered terribly from
cramp in consequence. We would wait and rub, but
directly we tried to move again down it would come and
grip our legs in a vice. We also, especially Bowers, suffered
agony from cramp in the stomach. We let the primus burn
on after supper now for a time&mdash;it was the only thing
which kept us going&mdash;and when one who was holding the
primus was seized with cramp we hastily took the lamp
from him until the spasm was over. It was horrible to see
Birdie's stomach cramp sometimes: he certainly got it
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>much worse than Bill or I. I suffered a lot from heartburn
especially in my bag at nights: we were eating a great
proportion of fat and this was probably the cause. Stupidly
I said nothing about it for a long time. Later when Bill
found out, he soon made it better with the medical case.</p>

<p>Birdie always lit the candle in the morning&mdash;so called
and this was an heroic business. Moisture collected on our
matches if you looked at them. Partly I suppose it was
bringing them from outside into a comparatively warm
tent; partly from putting boxes into pockets in our clothing.
Sometimes it was necessary to try four or five boxes
before a match struck. The temperature of the boxes and
matches was about a hundred degrees of frost, and the
smallest touch of the metal on naked flesh caused a frost-bite.
If you wore mitts you could scarcely feel anything&mdash;especially
since the tips of our fingers were already very
callous. To get the first light going in the morning was a
beastly cold business, made worse by having to make sure
that it was at last time to get up. Bill insisted that we must
lie in our bags seven hours every night.</p>

<p>In civilization men are taken at their own valuation
because there are so many ways of concealment, and
there is so little time, perhaps even so little understanding.
Not so down South. These two men went through the
Winter Journey and lived: later they went through the
Polar Journey and died. They were gold, pure, shining,
unalloyed. Words cannot express how good their companionship
was.</p>

<p>Through all these days, and those which were to follow,
the worst I suppose in their dark severity that men have
ever come through alive, no single hasty or angry word
passed their lips. When, later, we were sure, so far as we
can be sure of anything, that we must die, they were cheerful,
and so far as I can judge their songs and cheery words
were quite unforced. Nor were they ever flurried, though
always as quick as the conditions would allow in moments
of emergency. It is hard that often such men must go
first when others far less worthy remain.</p>

<p>There are those who write of Polar Expeditions as
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>though the whole thing was as easy as possible. They are
trusting, I suspect, in a public who will say, &quot;What a fine
fellow this is! we know what horrors he has endured, yet
see, how little he makes of all his difficulties and hardships.&quot;
Others have gone to the opposite extreme. I do
not know that there is any use in trying to make a -18&deg;
temperature appear formidable to an uninitiated reader by
calling it fifty degrees of frost. I want to do neither of
these things. I am not going to pretend that this was anything
but a ghastly journey, made bearable and even
pleasant to look back upon by the qualities of my two companions
who have gone. At the same time I have no wish
to make it appear more horrible than it actually was: the
reader need not fear that I am trying to exaggerate.</p>

<p>During the night of July 3 the temperature dropped to
-65&deg;, but in the morning we wakened (we really did wake
that morning) to great relief. The temperature was only
-27&deg; with the wind blowing some 15 miles an hour with
steadily falling snow. It only lasted a few hours, and we
knew it must be blowing a howling blizzard outside the
windless area in which we lay, but it gave us time to sleep
and rest, and get thoroughly thawed, and wet, and warm,
inside our sleeping-bags. To me at any rate this modified
blizzard was a great relief, though we all knew that our
gear would be worse than ever when the cold came back.
It was quite impossible to march. During the course of
the day the temperature dropped to -44&deg;: during the
following night to -54&deg;.</p>

<p>The soft new snow which had fallen made the surface
the next day (July 5) almost impossible. We relayed as
usual, and managed to do eight hours' pulling, but we got
forward only 1&frac12; miles. The temperature ranged between
-55&deg; and -61&deg;, and there was at one time a considerable
breeze, the effect of which was paralysing. There was the
great circle of a halo round the moon with a vertical shaft,
and mock moons. We hoped that we were rising on to the
long snow cape which marks the beginning of Mount
Terror. That night the temperature was -75&deg;; at breakfast
-70&deg;; at noon nearly -77&deg;. The day lives in my
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>memory as that on which I found out that records are not
worth making. The thermometer as swung by Bowers
after lunch at 5.51 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> registered -77.5&deg;, which is 109&frac12;
degrees of frost, and is I suppose as cold as any one will
want to endure in darkness and iced-up gear and clothes.
The lowest temperature recorded by a Discovery Spring
Journey party was -67.7&deg;,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and in those days fourteen
days was a long time for a Spring Party to be away sledging
and they were in daylight. This was our tenth day out and
we hoped to be away for six weeks.</p>

<p>Luckily we were spared wind. Our naked candle burnt
steadily as we trudged back in our tracks to fetch our other
sledge, but if we touched metal for a fraction of a second
with naked fingers we were frost-bitten. To fasten the
strap buckles over the loaded sledge was difficult: to
handle the cooker, or mugs, or spoons, the primus or oil
can was worse. How Bowers managed with the meteorological
instruments I do not know, but the meteorological
log is perfectly kept. Yet as soon as you breathed near the
paper it was covered with a film of ice through which the
pencil would not bite. To handle rope was always cold and
in these very low temperatures dreadfully cold work. The
toggling up of our harnesses to the sledge we were about
to pull, the untoggling at the end of the stage, the lashing
up of our sleeping-bags in the morning, the fastening of
the cooker to the top of the instrument box, were bad, but
not nearly so bad as the smaller lashings which were now
strings of ice. One of the worst was round the weekly food
bag, and those round the pemmican, tea and butter bags
inside were thinner still. But the real devil was the lashing
of the tent door: it was like wire, and yet had to be tied
tight. If you had to get out of the tent during the seven
hours spent in our sleeping-bags you must tie a string as
stiff as a poker, and re-thaw your way into a bag already
as hard as a board. Our paraffin was supplied at a flash
point suitable to low temperatures and was only a little
milky: it was very difficult to splinter bits off the butter.<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></p>

<p>The temperature that night was -75.8&deg;, and I will not
pretend that it did not convince me that Dante was right
when he placed the circles of ice below the circles of fire.
Still we slept sometimes, and always we lay for seven
hours. Again and again Bill asked us how about going
back, and always we said no. Yet there was nothing I
should have liked better: I was quite sure that to dream
of Cape Crozier was the wildest lunacy. That day we had
advanced 1&frac12; miles by the utmost labour, and the usual
relay work. This was quite a good march&mdash;and Cape
Crozier is 67 miles from Cape Evans!</p>

<p>More than once in my short life I have been struck by
the value of the man who is blind to what appears to be a
common-sense certainty: he achieves the impossible. We
never spoke our thoughts: we discussed the Age of Stone
which was to come, when we built our cosy warm rock hut
on the slopes of Mount Terror, and ran our stove with
penguin blubber, and pickled little Emperors in warmth
and dryness. We were quite intelligent people, and we
must all have known that we were not going to see the
penguins and that it was folly to go forward. And yet
with quiet perseverance, in perfect friendship, almost with
gentleness those two men led on. I just did what I was
told.</p>

<p>It is desirable that the body should work, feed and
sleep at regular hours, and this is too often forgotten when
sledging. But just now we found we were unable to fit
8 hours marching and 7 hours in our sleeping-bags into
a 24-hour day: the routine camp work took more than
9 hours, such were the conditions. We therefore ceased to
observe the quite imaginary difference between night and
day, and it was noon on Friday (July 7) before we got
away. The temperature was -68&deg; and there was a thick
white fog: generally we had but the vaguest idea where
we were, and we camped at 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> after managing 1&frac34;
miles for the day. But what a relief. Instead of labouring
away, our hearts were beating more naturally: it was easier
to camp, we had some feeling in our hands, and our feet
had not gone to sleep. Birdie swung the thermometer and
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>found it only -55&deg;. &quot;Now if we tell people that to get only
87 degrees of frost can be an enormous relief they simply
won't believe us,&quot; I remember saying. Perhaps you won't
but it was, all the same: and I wrote that night: &quot;There
is something after all rather good in doing something never
done before.&quot; Things were looking up, you see.</p>

<p>Our hearts were doing very gallant work. Towards the
end of the march they were getting beaten and were finding
it difficult to pump the blood out to our extremities
There were few days that Wilson and I did not get some
part of our feet frost-bitten. As we camped, I suspect our
hearts were beating comparatively slowly and weakly.
Nothing could be done until a hot drink was ready&mdash;tea
for lunch, hot water for supper. Directly we started to
drink then the effect was wonderful: it was, said Wilson,
like putting a hot-water bottle against your heart. The
beats became very rapid and strong and you felt the
warmth travelling outwards and downwards. Then you
got your foot-gear off&mdash;puttees (cut in half and wound
round the bottom of the trousers), finnesko, saennegrass,
hair socks, and two pairs of woollen socks. Then you
nursed back your feet and tried to believe you were glad&mdash;a
frost-bite does not hurt until it begins to thaw. Later
came the blisters, and then the chunks of dead skin.</p>

<p>Bill was anxious. It seems that Scott had twice gone
for a walk with him during the Winter, and tried to persuade
him not to go, and only finally consented on condition
that Bill brought us all back unharmed: we were
Southern Journey men. Bill had a tremendous respect for
Scott, and later when we were about to make an effort to
get back home over the Barrier, and our case was very
desperate, he was most anxious to leave no gear behind at
Cape Crozier, even the scientific gear which could be of
no use to us and of which we had plenty more at the hut.
&quot;Scott will never forgive me if I leave gear behind,&quot; he
said. It is a good sledging principle, and the party which
does not follow it, or which leaves some of its load to be
fetched in later is seldom a good one: but it is a principle
which can be carried to excess.<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></p>

<p>And now Bill was feeling terribly responsible for both of
us. He kept on saying that he was sorry, but he had never
dreamed it was going to be as bad as this. He felt that
having asked us to come he was in some way chargeable
with our troubles. When leaders have this kind of feeling
about their men they get much better results, if the men
are good: if men are bad or even moderate they will try
and take advantage of what they consider to be softness.</p>

<p>The temperature on the night of July 7 was -59&deg;.</p>

<p>On July 8 we found the first sign that we might be
coming to an end of this soft, powdered, arrowrooty snow.
It was frightfully hard pulling; but every now and then
our finnesko pierced a thin crust before they sank right
in. This meant a little wind, and every now and then our
feet came down on a hard slippery patch under the soft
snow. We were surrounded by fog which walked along
with us, and far above us the moon was shining on its roof.
Steering was as difficult as the pulling, and four hours of
the hardest work only produced 1&frac14; miles in the morning,
and three more hours 1 mile in the afternoon&mdash;and the
temperature was -57&deg; with a breeze&mdash;horrible!</p>

<p>In the early morning of the next day snow began to fall
and the fog was dense: when we got up we could see
nothing at all anywhere. After the usual four hours to get
going in the morning we settled that it was impossible to
relay, for we should never be able to track ourselves back
to the second sledge. It was with very great relief that we
found we could move both sledges together, and I think
this was mainly due to the temperature which had risen
to -36&deg;.</p>

<p>This was our fourth day of fog in addition to the normal
darkness, and we knew we must be approaching the land.
It would be Terror Point, and the fog is probably caused
by the moist warm air coming up from the sea through
the pressure cracks and crevasses; for it is supposed that
the Barrier here is afloat.</p>

<p>I wish I could take you on to the great Ice Barrier some
calm evening when the sun is just dipping in the middle of
the night and show you the autumn tints on Ross Island.<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>
A last look round before turning in, a good day's march
behind, enough fine fat pemmican inside you to make you
happy, the homely smell of tobacco from the tent, a pleasant
sense of soft fur and the deep sleep to come. And
all the softest colours God has made are in the snow; on
Erebus to the west, where the wind can scarcely move his
cloud of smoke; and on Terror to the east, not so high,
and more regular in form. How peaceful and dignified it
all is.</p>

<p>That was what you might have seen four months ago
had you been out on the Barrier plain. Low down on the
extreme right or east of the land there was a black smudge
of rock peeping out from great snow-drifts: that was the
Knoll, and close under it were the cliffs of Cape Crozier,
the Knoll looking quite low and the cliffs invisible, although
they are eight hundred feet high, a sheer precipice
falling to the sea.</p>

<p>It is at Cape Crozier that the Barrier edge, which runs
for four hundred miles as an ice-cliff up to 200 feet high,
meets the land. The Barrier is moving against this land
at a rate which is sometimes not much less than a mile in a
year. Perhaps you can imagine the chaos which it piles up:
there are pressure ridges compared to which the waves
of the sea are like a ploughed field. These are worst at
Cape Crozier itself, but they extend all along the southern
slopes of Mount Terror, running parallel with the land,
and the disturbance which Cape Crozier makes is apparent
at Corner Camp some forty miles back on the Barrier in
the crevasses we used to find and the occasional ridges we
had to cross.</p>

<p>In the Discovery days the pressure just where it hit
Cape Crozier formed a small bay, and on the sea-ice
frozen in this bay the men of the Discovery found the only
Emperor penguin rookery which had ever been seen. The
ice here was not blown out by the blizzards which cleared
the Ross Sea, and open water or open leads were never far
away. This gave the Emperors a place to lay their eggs and
an opportunity to find their food. We had therefore to find
our way along the pressure to the Knoll, and thence pene<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>trate
<i>through</i> the pressure to the Emperors' Bay. And we
had to do it in the dark.</p>

<p>Terror Point, which we were approaching in the fog, is
a short twenty miles from the Knoll, and ends in a long
snow-tongue running out into the Barrier. The way had
been travelled a good many times in Discovery days and
in daylight, and Wilson knew there was a narrow path, free
from crevasses, which skirted along between the mountain
and the pressure ridges running parallel to it. But it is one
thing to walk along a corridor by day, and quite another to
try to do so at night, especially when there are no walls by
which you can correct your course&mdash;only crevasses. Anyway,
Terror Point must be somewhere close to us now,
and vaguely in front of us was that strip of snow, neither
Barrier nor mountain, which was our only way forward.</p>

<p>We began to realize, now that our eyes were more or
less out of action, how much we could do with our feet and
ears. The effect of walking in finnesko is much the same
as walking in gloves, and you get a sense of touch which
nothing else except bare feet could give you. Thus we
could feel every small variation in surface, every crust
through which our feet broke, every hardened patch below
the soft snow. And soon we began to rely more and more
upon the sound of our footsteps to tell us whether we were
on crevasses or solid ground. From now onwards we were
working among crevasses fairly constantly. I loathe them
in full daylight when much can be done to avoid them, and
when if you fall into them you can at any rate see where
the sides are, which way they run and how best to scramble
out; when your companions can see how to stop the sledge
to which you are all attached by your harness; how most
safely to hold the sledge when stopped; how, if you are
dangling fifteen feet down in a chasm, to work above you
to get you up to the surface again. And then our clothes
were generally something like clothes. Even under the ideal
conditions of good light, warmth and no wind, crevasses
are beastly, whether you are pulling over a level and uniform
snow surface, never knowing what moment will find
you dropping into some bottomless pit, or whether you
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>are rushing for the Alpine rope and the sledge, to help
some companion who has disappeared. I dream sometimes
now of bad days we had on the Beardmore and elsewhere,
when men were dropping through to be caught up
and hang at the full length of the harnesses and toggles
many times in an hour. On the same sledge as myself on
the Beardmore one man went down once head first, and
another eight times to the length of his harness in 25
minutes. And always you wondered whether your harness
was going to hold when the jerk came. But those days were
a Sunday School treat compared to our days of blind-man's
buff with the Emperor penguins among the crevasses of
Cape Crozier.</p>

<p>Our troubles were greatly increased by the state of our
clothes. If we had been dressed in lead we should have
been able to move our arms and necks and heads more
easily than we could now. If the same amount of icing had
extended to our legs I believe we should still be there,
standing unable to move: but happily the forks of our
trousers still remained movable. To get into our canvas
harnesses was the most absurd business. Quite in the
early days of our journey we met with this difficulty, and
somewhat foolishly decided not to take off our harness for
lunch. The harnesses thawed in the tent, and froze back
as hard as boards. Likewise our clothing was hard as
boards and stuck out from our bodies in every imaginable
fold and angle. To fit one board over the other required
the united efforts of the would-be wearer and his two companions,
and the process had to be repeated for each one of
us twice a day. Goodness knows how long it took; but it
cannot have been less than five minutes' thumping at each
man.</p>

<p>As we approached Terror Point in the fog we sensed
that we had risen and fallen over several rises. Every now
and then we felt hard slippery snow under our feet. Every
now and then our feet went through crusts in the surface.
And then quite suddenly, vague, indefinable, monstrous,
there loomed a something ahead. I remember having a feeling
as of ghosts about as we untoggled our harnesses from
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>the sledge, tied them together, and thus roped walked upwards
on that ice. The moon was showing a ghastly ragged
mountainous edge above us in the fog, and as we rose we
found that we were on a pressure ridge. We stopped,
looked at one another, and then <i>bang</i>&mdash;right under our
feet. More bangs, and creaks and groans; for that ice was
moving and splitting like glass. The cracks went off all
round us, and some of them ran along for hundreds of
yards. Afterwards we got used to it, but at first the effect
was very jumpy. From first to last during this journey we
had plenty of variety and none of that monotony which
is inevitable in sledging over long distances of Barrier in
summer. Only the long shivering fits following close one
after the other all the time we lay in our dreadful sleeping-bags,
hour after hour and night after night in those temperatures&mdash;they
were as monotonous as could be. Later
we got frost-bitten even as we lay in our sleeping-bags.
Things are getting pretty bad when you get frost-bitten in
your bag.</p>

<p>There was only a glow where the moon was; we stood
in a moonlit fog, and this was sufficient to show the edge
of another ridge ahead, and yet another on our left. We
were utterly bewildered. The deep booming of the ice
continued, and it may be that the tide has something to do
with this, though we were many miles from the ordinary
coastal ice. We went back, toggled up to our sledges again
and pulled in what we thought was the right direction,
always with that feeling that the earth may open underneath
your feet which you have in crevassed areas. But all
we found were more mounds and banks of snow and ice,
into which we almost ran before we saw them. We were
clearly lost. It was near midnight, and I wrote, &quot;it may
be the pressure ridges or it may be Terror, it is impossible
to say,&mdash;and I should think it is impossible to move
till it clears. We were steering N.E. when we got here
and returned S.W. till we seemed to be in a hollow and
camped.&quot;</p>

<p>The temperature had been rising from -36&deg; at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
and it was now -27&deg;; snow was falling and nothing
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>whatever could be seen. From under the tent came noises
as though some giant was banging a big empty tank. All
the signs were for a blizzard, and indeed we had not long
finished our supper and were thawing our way little by
little into our bags when the wind came away from the
south. Before it started we got a glimpse of black rock
and knew we must be in the pressure ridges where they
nearly join Mount Terror.</p>

<p>It is with great surprise that in looking up the records
I find that blizzard lasted three days, the temperature and
wind both rising till it was +9&deg; and blowing force 9 on
the morning of the second day (July 11). On the morning
of the third day (July 12) it was blowing storm force (10).
The temperature had thus risen over eighty degrees.</p>

<p>It was not an uncomfortable time. Wet and warm, the
risen temperature allowed all our ice to turn to water, and
we lay steaming and beautifully liquid, and wondered
sometimes what we should be like when our gear froze up
once more. But we did not do much wondering, I suspect:
we slept. From that point of view these blizzards were a
perfect Godsend.</p>

<p>We also revised our food rations. From the moment
we started to prepare for this journey we were asked by
Scott to try certain experiments in view of the Plateau
stage of the Polar Journey the following summer. It was
supposed that the Plateau stage would be the really tough
part of the Polar Journey, and no one then dreamed that
harder conditions could be found in the middle of the
Barrier in March than on the Plateau, ten thousand feet
higher, in February. In view of the extreme conditions we
knew we must meet on this winter journey, far harder of
course in point of weather than anything experienced on
the Polar Journey, we had determined to simplify our food
to the last degree. We only brought pemmican, biscuit,
butter and tea: and tea is not a food, only a pleasant
stimulant, and hot: the pemmican was excellent and came
from Beauvais, Copenhagen.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-35.jpg"><img src="./images/1-35_th.jpg" alt="Camp Work In A Blizzard, Passing In The Cooker&mdash;E. A.

<hr />


<p>The immediate advantage of this was that we had few
food bags to handle for each meal. If the air temperature
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>is 100 degrees of frost, then everything in the air is about
100 degrees of frost too. You have only to untie the lashings
of one bag in a -70&deg; temperature, with your feet
frozen and your fingers just nursed back after getting a
match to strike for the candle (you will have tried several
boxes&mdash;metal), to realize this as an advantage.</p>

<p>The immediate and increasingly pressing disadvantage
is that you have no sugar. Have you ever had a craving for
sugar which never leaves you, even when asleep? It is unpleasant.
As a matter of fact the craving for sweet things
never seriously worried us on this journey, and there must
have been some sugar in our biscuits which gave a pleasant
sweetness to our mid-day tea or nightly hot water when
broken up and soaked in it. These biscuits were specially
made for us by Huntley and Palmer: their composition
was worked out by Wilson and that firm's chemist, and is a
secret. But they are probably the most satisfying biscuit
ever made, and I doubt whether they can be improved
upon. There were two kinds, called Emergency and Antarctic,
but there was I think little difference between them
except in the baking. A well-baked biscuit was good to eat
when sledging if your supply of food was good: but if you
were very hungry an underbaked one was much preferred.
By taking individually different quantities of biscuit,
pemmican and butter we were able roughly to test the
proportions of proteids, fats and carbo-hydrates wanted by
the human body under such extreme circumstances. Bill
was all for fat, starting with 8 oz. butter, 12 oz. pemmican
and only 12 oz. biscuit a day. Bowers told me he
was going for proteids, 16 oz. pemmican and 16 oz. biscuit,
and suggested I should go the whole hog on carbo-hydrates.
I did not like this, since I knew I should want
more fat, but the rations were to be altered as necessary
during the journey, so there was no harm in trying. So I
started with 20 oz. of biscuit and 12 oz. of pemmican
a day.</p>

<p>Bowers was all right (this was usual with him), but he
did not eat all his extra pemmican. Bill could not eat all
his extra butter, but was satisfied. I got hungry, certainly
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>got more frost-bitten than the others, and wanted more fat.
I also got heartburn. However, before taking more fat I
increased my biscuits to 24 oz., but this did not satisfy
me; I wanted fat. Bill and I now took the same diet, he
giving me 4 oz. of butter which he could not eat, and I
giving him 4 oz. of biscuit which did not satisfy my
wants. We both therefore had 12 oz. pemmican, 16 oz
biscuit and 4 oz. butter a day, but we did not always
finish our butter. This is an extremely good ration, and we
had enough to eat during most of this journey. We certainly
could not have faced the conditions without.</p>

<p>I will not say that I was entirely easy in my mind as
we lay out that blizzard somewhere off Terror Point; I
don't know how the others were feeling. The unearthly
banging going on underneath us may have had something
to do with it. But we were quite lost in the pressure and it
might be the deuce and all to get out in the dark. The
wind eddied and swirled quite out of its usual straightforward
way, and the tent got badly snowed up: our
sledge had disappeared long ago. The position was not
altogether a comfortable one.</p>

<p>Tuesday night and Wednesday it blew up to force 10,
temperature from -7&deg; to +2&deg;. And then it began to
modify and get squally. By 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on Thursday (July 13)
the wind had nearly ceased, the temperature was falling
and the stars were shining through detached clouds. We
were soon getting our breakfast, which always consisted
of tea, followed by pemmican. We soaked our biscuits
in both. Then we set to work to dig out the sledges and
tent, a big job taking several hours. At last we got started.
In that jerky way in which I was still managing to jot a
few sentences down each night as a record, I wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;Did 7&frac12; miles during day&mdash;seems a marvellous run&mdash;rose
and fell over several ridges of Terror&mdash;in afternoon
suddenly came on huge crevasse on one of these&mdash;we were
quite high on Terror&mdash;moon saved us walking in&mdash;it
might have taken sledge and all.&quot;</p>

<p>To do seven miles in a day, a distance which had taken
us nearly a week in the past, was very heartening. The
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>temperature was between -20&deg; and -30&deg; all day, and that
was good too. When crossing the undulations which ran
down out of the mountain into the true pressure ridges on
our right we found that the wind which came down off the
mountain struck along the top of the undulation, and flowing
each way, caused a N.E. breeze on one side and a N.W.
breeze on the other. There seemed to be wind in the sky,
and the blizzard had not cleared as far away as we should
have wished.</p>

<p>During the time through which we had come it was
by burning more oil than is usually allowed for cooking
that we kept going at all. After each meal was cooked
we allowed the primus to burn on for a while and thus
warmed up the tent. Then we could nurse back our frozen
feet and do any necessary little odd jobs. More often
we just sat and nodded for a few minutes, keeping one
another from going too deeply to sleep. But it was running
away with the oil. We started with 6 one-gallon tins (those
tins Scott had criticized), and we had now used four of
them. At first we said we must have at least two one-gallon
tins with which to go back; but by now our estimate
had come down to one full gallon tin, and two full primus
lamps. Our sleeping-bags were awful. It took me, even as
early in the journey as this, an hour of pushing and thumping
and cramp every night to thaw out enough of mine to
get into it at all. Even that was not so bad as lying in them
when we got there.</p>

<p>Only -35&deg; but &quot;a very bad night&quot; according to my
diary. We got away in good time, but it was a ghastly day
and my nerves were quivering at the end, for we could not
find that straight and narrow way which led between the
crevasses on either hand. Time after time we found we
were out of our course by the sudden fall of the ground
beneath our feet&mdash;in we went and then&mdash;&quot;are we too far
right?&quot;&mdash;nobody knows&mdash;&quot;well let's try nearer in to the
mountain,&quot; and so forth! &quot;By hard slogging 2&frac34; miles
this morning&mdash;then on in thick gloom which suddenly
lifted and we found ourselves under a huge great mountain
of pressure ridge looking black in shadow. We went on,
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>bending to the left, when Bill fell and put his arm into a
crevasse. We went over this and another, and some time
after got somewhere up to the left, and both Bill and I put
a foot into a crevasse. We sounded all about and everywhere
was hollow, and so we ran the sledge down over it
and all was well.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Once we got right into the pressure and
took a longish time to get out again. Bill lengthened his
trace out with the Alpine rope now and often afterwards so
he found the crevasses well ahead of us and the sledge:
nice for us but not so nice for Bill. Crevasses in the dark
<i>do</i> put your nerves on edge.</p>

<p>When we started next morning (July 15) we could see
on our left front and more or less on top of us the Knoll,
which is a big hill whose precipitous cliffs to seaward form
Cape Crozier. The sides of it sloped down towards us, and
pressing against its ice-cliffs on ahead were miles and miles
of great pressure ridges, along which we had travelled, and
which hemmed us in. Mount Terror rose ten thousand
feet high on our left, and was connected with the Knoll by
a great cup-like drift of wind-polished snow. The slope of
this in one place runs gently out on to the corridor along
which we had sledged, and here we turned and started
to pull our sledges up. There were no crevasses, only the
great drift of snow, so hard that we used our crampons
just as though we had been on ice, and as polished as the
china sides of a giant cup which it resembled. For three
miles we slogged up, until we were only 150 yards from
the moraine shelf where we were going to build our hut of
rocks and snow. This moraine was above us on our left,
the twin peaks of the Knoll were across the cup on our
right; and here, 800 feet up the mountain side, we pitched
our last camp.</p>

<p>We had arrived.</p>

<p>What should we call our hut? How soon could we get
our clothes and bags dry? How would the blubber stove
work? Would the penguins be there? &quot;It seems too good
to be true, 19 days out. Surely seldom has any one been so
wet; our bags hardly possible to get into, our wind-clothes
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>just frozen boxes. Birdie's patent balaclava is like iron&mdash;it
is wonderful how our cares have vanished.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>It was evening, but we were so keen to begin that we
went straight up to the ridge above our camp, where the
rock cropped out from the snow. We found that most of
it was <i>in situ</i> but that there were plenty of boulders, some
gravel, and of course any amount of the icy snow which
fell away below us down to our tent, and the great pressure
about a mile beyond. Between us and that pressure, as we
were to find out afterwards, was a great ice-cliff. The pressure
ridges, and the Great Ice Barrier beyond, were at our
feet; the Ross Sea edge but some four miles away. The
Emperors must be somewhere round that shoulder of the
Knoll which hides Cape Crozier itself from our view.</p>

<p>Our scheme was to build an igloo with rock walls,
banked up with snow, using a nine-foot sledge as a ridge
beam, and a large sheet of green Willesden canvas as a
roof. We had also brought a board to form a lintel over
the door. Here with the stove, which was to be fed with
blubber from the penguins, we were to have a comfortable
warm home whence we would make excursions to the
rookery perhaps four miles away. Perhaps we would manage
to get our tent down to the rookery itself and do our
scientific work there on the spot, leaving our nice hut for
a night or more. That is how we planned it.</p>

<p>That same night &quot;we started to dig in under a great
boulder on the top of the hill, hoping to make this a large
part of one of the walls of the hut, but the rock came close
underneath and stopped us. We then chose a moderately
level piece of moraine about twelve feet away, and just
under the level of the top of the hill, hoping that here in
the lee of the ridge we might escape a good deal of the
tremendous winds which we knew were common. Birdie
gathered rocks from over the hill, nothing was too big for
him; Bill did the banking up outside while I built the
wall with the boulders. The rocks were good, the snow,
however, was blown so hard as to be practically ice; a pick
made little impression upon it, and the only way was to
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>chip out big blocks gradually with the small shovel. The
gravel was scanty, but good when there was any. Altogether
things looked very hopeful when we turned in to
the tent some 150 yards down the slope, having done about
half one of the long walls.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The view from eight hundred feet up the mountain
was magnificent and I got my spectacles out and cleared
the ice away time after time to look. To the east a great
field of pressure ridges below, looking in the moonlight
as if giants had been ploughing with ploughs which made
furrows fifty or sixty feet deep: these ran right up to the
Barrier edge, and beyond was the frozen Ross Sea, lying
flat, white and peaceful as though such things as blizzards
were unknown. To the north and north-east the Knoll.
Behind us Mount Terror on which we stood, and over all
the grey limitless Barrier seemed to cast a spell of cold immensity,
vague, ponderous, a breeding-place of wind and
drift and darkness. God! What a place!</p>

<p>&quot;There was now little moonlight or daylight, but for
the next forty-eight hours we used both to their utmost,
being up at all times by day and night, and often working
on when there was great difficulty in seeing anything;
digging by the light of the hurricane lamp. By the end of
two days we had the walls built, and banked up to one or
two feet from the top; we were to fit the roof cloth close
before banking up the rest. The great difficulty in banking
was the hardness of the snow, it being impossible
to fill in the cracks between the blocks which were more
like paving-stones than anything else. The door was in,
being a triangular tent doorway, with flaps which we built
close in to the walls, cementing it with snow and rocks.
The top folded over a plank and the bottom was dug into
the ground.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Birdie was very disappointed that we could not finish
the whole thing that day: he was nearly angry about it,
but there was a lot to do yet and we were tired out. We
turned out early the next morning (Tuesday 18th) to try
and finish the igloo, but it was blowing too hard. When
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>we got to the top we did some digging but it was quite
impossible to get the roof on, and we had to leave it. We
realized that day that it blew much harder at the top of the
slope than where our tent was. It was bitterly cold up there
that morning with a wind force 4-5 and a minus thirty temperature.</p>

<p>The oil question was worrying us quite a lot. We were
now well in to the fifth of our six tins, and economizing as
much as possible, often having only two hot meals a day.
We had to get down to the Emperor penguins somehow
and get some blubber to run the stove which had been
made for us in the hut. The 19th being a calm fine day we
started at 9.30, with an empty sledge, two ice-axes, Alpine
rope, harnesses and skinning tools.</p>

<p>Wilson had made this journey through the Cape Crozier
pressure ridges several times in the Discovery days. But
then they had daylight, and they had found a practicable
way close under the cliffs which at the present moment
were between us and the ridges.</p>

<p>As we neared the bottom of the mountain slope, farther
to the north than we had previously gone, we had to be
careful about crevasses, but we soon hit off the edge of the
cliff and skirted along it until it petered out on the same
level as the Barrier. Turning left handed we headed towards
the sea-ice, knowing that there were some two miles
of pressure between us and Cape Crozier itself. For about
half a mile it was fair going, rounding big knobs of pressure
but always managing to keep more or less on the flat
and near the ice-cliff which soon rose to a very great height
on our left. Bill's idea was to try and keep close under this
cliff, along that same Discovery way which I have mentioned
above. They never arrived there early enough for
the eggs in those days; the chicks were hatched. Whether
we should now find any Emperors, and if so whether they
would have any eggs, was by no means certain.</p>

<p>However, we soon began to get into trouble, meeting
several crevasses every few yards, and I have no doubt
crossing scores of others of which we had no knowledge.
Though we hugged the cliffs as close as possible we found
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>ourselves on the top of the first pressure ridge, separated
by a deep gulf from the ice-slope which we wished to
reach. Then we were in a great valley between the first and
second ridges: we got into huge heaps of ice pressed up in
every shape on every side, crevassed in every direction: we
slithered over snow-slopes and crawled along drift ridges,
trying to get in towards the cliffs. And always we came up
against impossible places and had to crawl back. Bill led on
a length of Alpine rope fastened to the toggle of the sledge;
Birdie was in his harness also fastened to the toggle, and I
was in my harness fastened to the rear of the sledge, which
was of great use to us both as a bridge and a ladder.</p>

<p>Two or three times we tried to get down the ice-slopes
to the comparatively level road under the cliff, but it was
always too great a drop. In that dim light every proportion
was distorted; some of the places we actually did
manage to negotiate with ice-axes and Alpine rope looked
absolute precipices, and there were always crevasses at the
bottom if you slipped. On the way back I did slip into one
of these and was hauled out by the other two standing on
the wall above me.</p>

<p>We then worked our way down into the hollow between
the first and second large pressure ridges, and I believe on
to the top of the second. The crests here rose fifty or
sixty feet. After this I don't know where we went. Our
best landmarks were patches of crevasses, sometimes three
or four in a few footsteps. The temperatures were lowish
(-37&deg;), it was impossible for me to wear spectacles, and
this was a tremendous difficulty to me and handicap to the
party: Bill would find a crevasse and point it out; Birdie
would cross; and then time after time, in trying to step
over or climb over on the sledge, I put my feet right into
the middle of the cracks. This day I went well in at least
six times; once, when we were close to the sea, rolling into
and out of one and then down a steep slope until brought
up by Birdie and Bill on the rope.</p>

<hr />


<p>We blundered along until we got into a great cul-de-sac
which probably formed the end of the two ridges,
where they butted on to the sea-ice. On all sides rose great
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>walls of battered ice with steep snow-slopes in the middle,
where we slithered about and blundered into crevasses. To
the left rose the huge cliff of Cape Crozier, but we could
not tell whether there were not two or three pressure ridges
between us and it, and though we tried at least four ways,
there was no possibility of getting forward.</p>

<p>And then we heard the Emperors calling.</p>

<p>Their cries came to us from the sea-ice we could not see,
but which must have been a chaotic quarter of a mile away.
They came echoing back from the cliffs, as we stood helpless
and tantalized. We listened and realized that there
was nothing for it but to return, for the little light which
now came in the middle of the day was going fast, and to
be caught in absolute darkness there was a horrible idea.
We started back on our tracks and almost immediately I
lost my footing and rolled down a slope into a crevasse.
Birdie and Bill kept their balance and I clambered back to
them. The tracks were very faint and we soon began to
lose them. Birdie was the best man at following tracks that
I have ever known, and he found them time after time.
But at last even he lost them altogether and we settled we
must just go ahead. As a matter of fact, we picked them
up again, and by then were out of the worst: but we were
glad to see the tent.</p>

<p>The next morning (Thursday, June 20) we started
work on the igloo at 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and managed to get the canvas
roof on in spite of a wind which harried us all that day.
Little did we think what that roof had in store for us as we
packed it in with snow blocks, stretching it over our second
sledge, which we put athwartships across the middle of
the longer walls. The windward (south) end came right
down to the ground and we tied it securely to rocks before
packing it in. On the other three sides we had a good
two feet or more of slack all round, and in every case we
tied it to rocks by lanyards at intervals of two feet. The
door was the difficulty, and for the present we left the
cloth arching over the stones, forming a kind of portico.
The whole was well packed in and over with slabs of hard
snow, but there was no soft snow with which to fill up the
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>gaps between the blocks. However, we felt already that
nothing could drag that roof out of its packing, and subsequent
events proved that we were right.</p>

<p>It was a bleak job for three o'clock in the morning before
breakfast, and we were glad to get back to the tent
and a meal, for we meant to have another go at the Emperors
that day. With the first glimpse of light we were
off for the rookery again.</p>

<p>But we now knew one or two things about that pressure
which we had not known twenty-four hours ago; for instance,
that there was a lot of alteration since the Discovery
days and that probably the pressure was bigger.
As a matter of fact it has been since proved by photographs
that the ridges now ran out three-quarters of a mile
farther into the sea than they did ten years before. We
knew also that if we entered the pressure at the only place
where the ice-cliffs came down to the level of the Barrier,
as we did yesterday, we could neither penetrate to the
rookery nor get in under the cliffs where formerly a possible
way had been found. There was only one other thing
to do&mdash;to go over the cliff. And this was what we proposed
to try and do.</p>

<p>Now these ice-cliffs are some two hundred feet high, and
I felt uncomfortable, especially in the dark. But as we
came back the day before we had noticed at one place a
break in the cliffs from which there hung a snow-drift. It
<i>might</i> be possible to get down that drift.</p>

<p>And so, all harnessed to the sledge, with Bill on a long
lead out in front and Birdie and myself checking the sledge
behind, we started down the slope which ended in the cliff,
which of course we could not see. We crossed a number
of small crevasses, and soon we knew we must be nearly
there. Twice we crept up to the edge of the cliff with
no success, and then we found the slope: more, we got
down it without great difficulty and it brought us out just
where we wanted to be, between the land cliffs and the
pressure.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-38.jpg"><img src="./images/1-38_th.jpg" alt="The Barrier Pressure At Cape Crozier" title="The Barrier Pressure At Cape Crozier" /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">The Barrier Pressure At Cape Crozier</span></p>
<hr />


<p>Then began the most exciting climb among the pressure
that you can imagine. At first very much as it was the
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>day before&mdash;pulling ourselves and one another up ridges,
slithering down slopes, tumbling into and out of crevasses
and holes of all sorts, we made our way along under the
cliffs which rose higher and higher above us as we neared
the black lava precipices which form Cape Crozier itself.
We straddled along the top of a snow ridge with a razor-backed
edge, balancing the sledge between us as we
wriggled: on our right was a drop of great depth with
crevasses at the bottom, on our left was a smaller drop also
crevassed. We crawled along, and I can tell you it was
exciting work in the more than half darkness. At the end
was a series of slopes full of crevasses, and finally we got
right in under the rock on to moraine, and here we had to
leave the sledge.</p>

<p>We roped up, and started to worry along under the
cliffs, which had now changed from ice to rock, and rose
800 feet above us. The tumult of pressure which climbed
against them showed no order here. Four hundred miles
of moving ice behind it had just tossed and twisted those
giant ridges until Job himself would have lacked words to
reproach their Maker. We scrambled over and under,
hanging on with our axes, and cutting steps where we
could not find a foothold with our crampons. And always
we got towards the Emperor penguins, and it really began
to look as if we were going to do it this time, when we came
up against a wall of ice which a single glance told us we
could never cross. One of the largest pressure ridges had
been thrown, end on, against the cliff. We seemed to be
stopped, when Bill found a black hole, something like a
fox's earth, disappearing into the bowels of the ice. We
looked at it: &quot;Well, here goes!&quot; he said, and put his
head in, and disappeared. Bowers likewise. It was a longish
way, but quite possible to wriggle along, and presently
I found myself looking out of the other side with a deep
gully below me, the rock face on one hand and the ice
on the other. &quot;Put your back against the ice and your feet
against the rock and lever yourself along,&quot; said Bill, who
was already standing on firm ice at the far end in a snow
pit. We cut some fifteen steps to get out of that hole.<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>
Excited by now, and thoroughly enjoying ourselves, we
found the way ahead easier, until the penguins' call reached
us again and we stood, three crystallized ragamuffins, above
the Emperors' home. They were there all right, and we
were going to reach them, but where were all the thousands
of which we had heard?</p>

<p>We stood on an ice-foot which was really a dwarf cliff
some twelve feet high, and the sea-ice, with a good many
ice-blocks strewn upon it, lay below. The cliff dropped
straight, with a bit of an overhang and no snow-drift. This
may have been because the sea had only frozen recently;
whatever the reason may have been it meant that we should
have a lot of difficulty in getting up again without help.
It was decided that some one must stop on the top with
the Alpine rope, and clearly that one should be I, for
with short sight and fogged spectacles which I could not
wear I was much the least useful of the party for the job
immediately ahead. Had we had the sledge we could have
used it as a ladder, but of course we had left this at the
beginning of the moraine miles back.</p>

<p>We saw the Emperors standing all together huddled
under the Barrier cliff some hundreds of yards away. The
little light was going fast: we were much more excited
about the approach of complete darkness and the look of
wind in the south than we were about our triumph. After
indescribable effort and hardship we were witnessing a
marvel of the natural world, and we were the first and only
men who had ever done so; we had within our grasp
material which might prove of the utmost importance to
science; we were turning theories into facts with every
observation we made,&mdash;and we had but a moment to give.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/1-39.jpg"><img src="./images/1-39_th.jpg" alt="Emperors Barrier And Sea Ice&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." title="Emperors Barrier And Sea Ice&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del." /></a></p><p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">Emperors Barrier And Sea Ice</span>&mdash;E. A. Wilson, del.</p>
<hr />


<p>The disturbed Emperors made a tremendous row,
trumpeting with their curious metallic voices. There was
no doubt they had eggs, for they tried to shuffle along
the ground without losing them off their feet. But when
they were hustled a good many eggs were dropped and left
lying on the ice, and some of these were quickly picked
up by eggless Emperors who had probably been waiting
a long time for the opportunity. In these poor birds the
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>maternal side seems to have necessarily swamped the other
functions of life. Such is the struggle for existence that
they can only live by a glut of maternity, and it would be
interesting to know whether such a life leads to happiness
or satisfaction.</p>

<p>I have told<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> how the men of the Discovery found this
rookery where we now stood. How they made journeys
in the early spring but never arrived early enough to
get eggs and only found parents and chicks. They concluded
that the Emperor was an impossible kind of bird
who, for some reason or other, nests in the middle of the
Antarctic winter with the temperature anywhere below
seventy degrees of frost, and the blizzards blowing, always
blowing, against his devoted back. And they found him
holding his precious chick balanced upon his big feet,
and pressing it maternally, or paternally (for both sexes
squabble for the privilege) against a bald patch in his
breast. And when at last he simply must go and eat something
in the open leads near by, he just puts the child
down on the ice, and twenty chickless Emperors rush to
pick it up. And they fight over it, and so tear it that sometimes
it will die. And, if it can, it will crawl into any ice-crack
to escape from so much kindness, and there it will
freeze. Likewise many broken and addled eggs were
found, and it is clear that the mortality is very great. But
some survive, and summer comes; and when a big blizzard
is going to blow (they know all about the weather),
the parents take the children out for miles across the sea-ice,
until they reach the threshold of the open sea. And
there they sit until the wind comes, and the swell rises,
and breaks that ice-floe off; and away they go in the blinding
drift to join the main pack-ice, with a private yacht
all to themselves.</p>

<p>You must agree that a bird like this is an interesting
beast, and when, seven months ago, we rowed a boat under
those great black cliffs,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and found a disconsolate Emperor
chick still in the down, we knew definitely why the
Emperor has to nest in mid-winter. For if a June egg was
<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>still without feathers in the beginning of January, the
same egg laid in the summer would leave its produce without
practical covering for the following winter. Thus the
Emperor penguin is compelled to undertake all kinds of
hardships because his children insist on developing so
slowly, very much as we are tied in our human relationships
for the same reason. It is of interest that such a
primitive bird should have so long a childhood.</p>

<p>But interesting as the life history of these birds must
be, we had not travelled for three weeks to see them
sitting on their eggs. We wanted the embryos, and we
wanted them as young as possible, and fresh and unfrozen
that specialists at home might cut them into microscopic
sections and learn from them the previous history of birds
throughout the evolutionary ages. And so Bill and Birdie
rapidly collected five eggs, which we hoped to carry safely
in our fur mitts to our igloo upon Mount Terror, where we
could pickle them in the alcohol we had brought for the
purpose. We also wanted oil for our blubber stove, and
they killed and skinned three birds&mdash;an Emperor weighs
up to 6&frac12; stones.</p>

<p>The Ross Sea was frozen over, and there were no seal in
sight. There were only 100 Emperors as compared with
2000 in 1902 and 1903. Bill reckoned that every fourth
or fifth bird had an egg, but this was only a rough estimate,
for we did not want to disturb them unnecessarily.
It is a mystery why there should have been so few birds,
but it certainly looked as though the ice had not formed
very long. Were these the first arrivals? Had a previous
rookery been blown out to sea and was this the beginning
of a second attempt? Is this bay of sea-ice becoming
unsafe?</p>

<p>Those who previously discovered the Emperors with
their chicks saw the penguins nursing dead and frozen
chicks if they were unable to obtain a live one. They also
found decomposed eggs which they must have incubated
after they had been frozen. Now we found that these birds
were so anxious to sit on something that some of those
which had no eggs were sitting on ice! Several times Bill
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>and Birdie picked up eggs to find them lumps of ice,
rounded and about the right size, dirty and hard. Once
a bird dropped an ice nest egg as they watched, and again
a bird returned and tucked another into itself, immediately
forsaking it for a real one, however, when one was offered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a whole procession of Emperors came
round under the cliff on which I stood. The light was
already very bad and it was well that my companions were
quick in returning: we had to do everything in a great
hurry. I hauled up the eggs in their mitts (which we
fastened together round our necks with lampwick lanyards)
and then the skins, but failed to help Bill at all.
&quot;Pull,&quot; he cried, from the bottom: &quot;I am pulling,&quot; I
said. &quot;But the line's quite slack down here,&quot; he shouted.
And when he had reached the top by climbing up on
Bowers' shoulders, and we were both pulling all we knew
Birdie's end of the rope was still slack in his hands.
Directly we put on a strain the rope cut into the ice edge
and jammed&mdash;a very common difficulty when working
among crevasses. We tried to run the rope over an ice-axe
without success, and things began to look serious when
Birdie, who had been running about prospecting and had
meanwhile put one leg through a crack into the sea, found
a place where the cliff did not overhang. He cut steps for
himself, we hauled, and at last we were all together on the
top&mdash;his foot being by now surrounded by a solid mass of
ice.</p>

<p>We legged it back as hard as we could go: five eggs
in our fur mitts, Birdie with two skins tied to him and
trailing behind, and myself with one. We were roped up,
and climbing the ridges and getting through the holes was
very difficult. In one place where there was a steep rubble
and snow slope down I left the ice-axe half way up; in
another it was too dark to see our former ice-axe footsteps,
and I could see nothing, and so just let myself go and
trusted to luck. With infinite patience Bill said: &quot;Cherry,
you <i>must</i> learn how to use an ice-axe.&quot; For the rest of the
trip my wind-clothes were in rags.</p>

<p>We found the sledge, and none too soon, and now had
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>three eggs left, more or less whole. Both mine had burst
in my mitts: the first I emptied out, the second I left in my
mitt to put into the cooker; it never got there, but on the
return journey I had my mitts far more easily thawed out
than Birdie's (Bill had none) and I believe the grease in
the egg did them good. When we got into the hollows
under the ridge where we had to cross, it was too dark
to do anything but feel our way. We did so over many
crevasses, found the ridge and crept over it. Higher up we
could see more, but to follow our tracks soon became impossible,
and we plugged straight ahead and luckily found
the slope down which we had come. All day it had been
blowing a nasty cold wind with a temperature between
-20&deg; and 30&deg;, which we felt a good deal. Now it began
to get worse. The weather was getting thick and things
did not look very nice when we started up to find our
tent. Soon it was blowing force 4, and soon we missed
our way entirely. We got right up above the patch of rocks
which marked our igloo and only found it after a good deal
of search.</p>

<p>I have heard tell of an English officer at the Dardanelles
who was left, blinded, in No Man's Land between
the English and Turkish trenches. Moving only at night,
and having no sense to tell him which were his own
trenches, he was fired at by Turk and English alike as he
groped his ghastly way to and from them. Thus he spent
days and nights until, one night, he crawled towards the
English trenches, to be fired at as usual. &quot;Oh God! what
can I do!&quot; some one heard him say, and he was brought in.</p>

<p>Such extremity of suffering cannot be measured: madness
or death may give relief. But this I know: we on
this journey were already beginning to think of death as
a friend. As we groped our way back that night, sleepless,
icy, and dog-tired in the dark and the wind and the
drift, a crevasse seemed almost a friendly gift.</p>

<p>&quot;Things must improve,&quot; said Bill next day, &quot;I think
we reached bed-rock last night.&quot; We hadn't, by a long
way.</p>

<p>It was like this.<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a></p>

<p>We moved into the igloo for the first time, for we had
to save oil by using our blubber stove if we were to have
any left to travel home with, and we did not wish to cover
our tent with the oily black filth which the use of blubber
necessitates. The blizzard blew all night, and we were
covered with drift which came in through hundreds of
leaks: in this wind-swept place we had found no soft snow
with which we could pack our hard snow blocks. As we
flensed some blubber from one of our penguin skins the
powdery drift covered everything we had.</p>

<p>Though uncomfortable this was nothing to worry about
overmuch. Some of the drift which the blizzard was bringing
would collect to leeward of our hut and the rocks below
which it was built, and they could be used to make our hut
more weather-proof. Then with great difficulty we got the
blubber stove to start, and it spouted a blob of boiling oil
into Bill's eye. For the rest of the night he lay, quite
unable to stifle his groans, obviously in very great pain:
he told us afterwards that he thought his eye was gone.
We managed to cook a meal somehow, and Birdie got the
stove going afterwards, but it was quite useless to try and
warm the place. I got out and cut the green canvas outside
the door, so as to get the roof cloth in under the
stones, and then packed it down as well as I could with
snow, and so blocked most of the drift coming in.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how often angels and fools do the
same thing in this life, and I have never been able to settle
which we were on this journey. I never heard an angry
word: once only (when this same day I could not pull Bill
up the cliff out of the penguin rookery) I heard an impatient
one: and these groans were the nearest approach
to complaint. Most men would have howled. &quot;I think
we reached bed-rock last night,&quot; was strong language for
Bill. &quot;I was incapacitated for a short time,&quot; he says in his
report to Scott.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Endurance was tested on this journey
under unique circumstances, and always these two men
with all the burden of responsibility which did not fall
upon myself, displayed that quality which is perhaps the
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>only one which may be said with certainty to make for success,
self-control.</p>

<p>We spent the next day&mdash;it was July 21&mdash;in collecting
every scrap of soft snow we could find and packing
it into the crevasses between our hard snow blocks. It
was a pitifully small amount but we could see no cracks
when we had finished. To counteract the lifting tendency
the wind had on our roof we cut some great flat hard
snow blocks and laid them on the canvas top to steady it
against the sledge which formed the ridge support. We
also pitched our tent outside the igloo door. Both tent and
igloo were therefore eight or nine hundred feet up Terror:
both were below an outcrop of rocks from which the mountain
fell steeply to the Barrier behind us, and from this
direction came the blizzards. In front of us the slope fell
for a mile or more down to the ice-cliffs, so wind-swept that
we had to wear crampons to walk upon it. Most of the tent
was in the lee of the igloo, but the cap of it came over the
igloo roof, while a segment of the tent itself jutted out
beyond the igloo wall.</p>

<p>That night we took much of our gear into the tent and
lighted the blubber stove. I always mistrusted that stove,
and every moment I expected it to flare up and burn the
tent. But the heat it gave, as it burned furiously, with the
double lining of the tent to contain it, was considerable.</p>

<p>It did not matter, except for a routine which we never
managed to keep, whether we started to thaw our way into
our frozen sleeping-bags at 4 in the morning or 4 in the
afternoon. I think we must have turned in during the
afternoon of that Friday, leaving the cooker, our finnesko,
a deal of our foot-gear, Bowers' bag of personal gear, and
many other things in the tent. I expect we left the blubber
stove there too, for it was quite useless at present to try and
warm the igloo. The tent floor-cloth was under our sleeping-bags
in the igloo.</p>

<p>&quot;Things must improve,&quot; said Bill. After all there was
much for which to be thankful. I don't think anybody
could have made a better igloo with the hard snow blocks
and rocks which were all we had: we would get it air-tight
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>by degrees. The blubber stove was working, and we had
fuel for it: we had also found a way down to the penguins
and had three complete, though frozen eggs: the two
which had been in my mitts smashed when I fell about
because I could not wear spectacles. Also the twilight
given by the sun below the horizon at noon was getting
longer.</p>

<p>But already we had been out twice as long in winter
as the longest previous journeys in spring. The men who
made those journeys had daylight where we had darkness,
they had never had such low temperatures, generally
nothing approaching them, and they had seldom worked
in such difficult country. The nearest approach to healthy
sleep we had had for nearly a month was when during
blizzards the temperature allowed the warmth of our bodies
to thaw some of the ice in our clothing and sleeping-bags
into water. The wear and tear on our minds was very
great. We were certainly weaker. We had a little more
than a tin of oil to get back on, and we knew the conditions
we had to face on that journey across the Barrier:
even with fresh men and fresh gear it had been almost unendurable.</p>

<p>And so we spent half an hour or more getting into our
bags. Cirrus cloud was moving across the face of the
stars from the north, it looked rather hazy and thick to
the south, but it is always difficult to judge weather in the
dark. There was little wind and the temperature was in
the minus twenties. We felt no particular uneasiness. Our
tent was well dug in, and was also held down by rocks and
the heavy tank off the sledge which were placed on the
skirting as additional security. We felt that no power
on earth could move the thick walls of our igloo, nor drag
the canvas roof from the middle of the embankment into
which it was packed and lashed.</p>

<p>&quot;Things must improve,&quot; said Bill.</p>

<p>I do not know what time it was when I woke up. It was
calm, with that absolute silence which can be so soothing
or so terrible as circumstances dictate. Then there came
a sob of wind, and all was still again. Ten minutes and it
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>was blowing as though the world was having a fit of hysterics.
The earth was torn in pieces: the indescribable
fury and roar of it all cannot be imagined.</p>

<p>&quot;Bill, Bill, the tent has gone,&quot; was the next I remember&mdash;from
Bowers shouting at us again and again through
the door. It is always these early morning shocks which
hit one hardest: our slow minds suggested that this might
mean a peculiarly lingering form of death. Journey after
journey Birdie and I fought our way across the few yards
which had separated the tent from the igloo door. I have
never understood why so much of our gear which was in
the tent remained, even in the lee of the igloo. The place
where the tent had been was littered with gear, and when
we came to reckon up afterwards we had everything except
the bottom piece of the cooker, and the top of the outer
cooker. We never saw these again. The most wonderful
thing of all was that our finnesko were lying where they
were left, which happened to be on the ground in the part
of the tent which was under the lee of the igloo. Also
Birdie's bag of personal gear was there, and a tin of sweets.</p>

<p>Birdie brought two tins of sweets away with him. One
we had to celebrate our arrival at the Knoll: this was the
second, of which we knew nothing, and which was for
Bill's birthday, the next day. We started eating them on
Saturday, however, and the tin came in useful to Bill afterwards.</p>

<p>To get that gear in we fought against solid walls of
black snow which flowed past us and tried to hurl us down
the slope. Once started nothing could have stopped us.
I saw Birdie knocked over once, but he clawed his way back
just in time. Having passed everything we could find in
to Bill, we got back into the igloo, and started to collect
things together, including our very dishevelled minds.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that we were in the devil of a mess,
and it was not altogether our fault. We had had to put
our igloo more or less where we could get rocks with
which to build it. Very naturally we had given both our
tent and igloo all the shelter we could from the full force
of the wind, and now it seemed we were in danger not
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>because they were in the wind, but because they were
not sufficiently in it. The main force of the hurricane,
deflected by the ridge behind, fled over our heads and
appeared to form by suction a vacuum below. Our tent
had either been sucked upwards into this, or had been
blown away because some of it was in the wind while some
of it was not. The roof of our igloo was being wrenched
upwards and then dropped back with great crashes: the
drift was spouting in, not it seemed because it was blown
in from outside, but because it was sucked in from within:
the lee, not the weather, wall was the worst. Already everything
was six or eight inches under snow.</p>

<p>Very soon we began to be alarmed about the igloo.
For some time the heavy snow blocks we had heaved up
on to the canvas roof kept it weighted down. But it
seemed that they were being gradually moved off by the
hurricane. The tension became well-nigh unendurable:
the waiting in all that welter of noise was maddening.
Minute after minute, hour after hour&mdash;those snow blocks
were off now anyway, and the roof was smashed up and
down&mdash;no canvas ever made could stand it indefinitely.</p>

<p>We got a meal that Saturday morning, our last for a
very long time as it happened. Oil being of such importance
to us we tried to use the blubber stove, but after
several preliminary spasms it came to pieces in our hands,
some solder having melted; and a very good thing too,
I thought, for it was more dangerous than useful. We
finished cooking our meal on the primus. Two bits of the
cooker having been blown away we had to balance it on the
primus as best we could. We then settled that in view of
the shortage of oil we would not have another meal for as
long as possible. As a matter of fact God settled that
for us.</p>

<p>We did all we could to stop up the places where the
drift was coming in, plugging the holes with our socks,
mitts and other clothing. But it was no real good. Our
igloo was a vacuum which was filling itself up as soon as
possible: and when snow was not coming in a fine black
moraine dust took its place, covering us and everything.<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>
For twenty-four hours we waited for the roof to go: things
were so bad now that we dare not unlash the door.</p>

<p>Many hours ago Bill had told us that if the roof went he
considered that our best chance would be to roll over in our
sleeping-bags until we were lying on the openings, and get
frozen and drifted in.</p>

<p>Gradually the situation got more desperate. The distance
between the taut-sucked canvas and the sledge on
which it should have been resting became greater, and
this must have been due to the stretching of the canvas
itself and the loss of the snow blocks on the top: it was
not drawing out of the walls. The crashes as it dropped
and banged out again were louder. There was more snow
coming through the walls, though all our loose mitts, socks
and smaller clothing were stuffed into the worst places:
our pyjama jackets were stuffed between the roof and the
rocks over the door. The rocks were lifting and shaking
here till we thought they would fall.</p>

<p>We talked by shouting, and long before this one of us
proposed to try and get the Alpine rope lashed down over
the roof from outside. But Bowers said it was an absolute
impossibility in that wind. &quot;You could never ask men at
sea to try such a thing,&quot; he said. He was up and out of his
bag continually, stopping up holes, pressing against bits
of roof to try and prevent the flapping and so forth. He
was magnificent.</p>

<p>And then it went.</p>

<p>Birdie was over by the door, where the canvas which
was bent over the lintel board was working worse than
anywhere else. Bill was practically out of his bag pressing
against some part with a long stick of some kind. I don't
know what I was doing but I was half out of and half in
my bag.</p>

<p>The top of the door opened in little slits and that green
Willesden canvas flapped into hundreds of little fragments
in fewer seconds than it takes to read this. The uproar of
it all was indescribable. Even above the savage thunder
of that great wind on the mountain came the lash of the
canvas as it was whipped to little tiny strips. The highest
<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>rocks which we had built into our walls fell upon us, and a
sheet of drift came in.</p>

<p>Birdie dived for his sleeping-bag and eventually got in,
together with a terrible lot of drift. Bill also&mdash;but he was
better off: I was already half into mine and all right, so I
turned to help Bill. &quot;Get into your own,&quot; he shouted, and
when I continued to try and help him, he leaned over until
his mouth was against my ear. &quot;<i>Please</i>, Cherry,&quot; he said,
and his voice was terribly anxious. I know he felt responsible:
feared it was he who had brought us to this ghastly
end.</p>

<p>The next I knew was Bowers' head across Bill's body.
&quot;We're all right,&quot; he yelled, and we answered in the
affirmative. Despite the fact that we knew we only said
so because we knew we were all wrong, this statement was
helpful. Then we turned our bags over as far as possible,
so that the bottom of the bag was uppermost and the flaps
were more or less beneath us. And we lay and thought,
and sometimes we sang.</p>

<p>I suppose, wrote Wilson, we were all revolving plans
to get back without a tent: and the one thing we had
left was the floor-cloth upon which we were actually lying.
Of course we could not speak at present, but later after
the blizzard had stopped we discussed the possibility of
digging a hole in the snow each night and covering it over
with the floor-cloth. I do not think we had any idea that
we could really get back in those temperatures in our
present state of ice by such means, but no one ever hinted
at such a thing. Birdie and Bill sang quite a lot of songs
and hymns, snatches of which reached me every now and
then, and I chimed in, somewhat feebly I suspect. Of
course we were getting pretty badly drifted up. &quot;I was
resolved to keep warm,&quot; wrote Bowers, &quot;and beneath my
debris covering I paddled my feet and sang all the songs
and hymns I knew to pass the time. I could occasionally
thump Bill, and as he still moved I knew he was alive
all right&mdash;what a birthday for him!&quot; Birdie was more
drifted up than we, but at times we all had to hummock
ourselves up to heave the snow off our bags. By opening
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>the flaps of our bags we could get small pinches of soft
drift which we pressed together and put into our mouths
to melt. When our hands warmed up again we got some
more; so we did not get very thirsty. A few ribbons of
canvas still remained in the wall over our heads, and these
produced volleys of cracks like pistol shots hour after hour
The canvas never drew out from the walls, not an inch
The wind made just the same noise as an express train running
fast through a tunnel if you have both the windows
down.</p>

<p>I can well believe that neither of my companions gave
up hope for an instant. They must have been frightened
but they were never disturbed. As for me I never had any
hope at all; and when the roof went I felt that this was
the end. What else could I think? We had spent days in
reaching this place through the darkness in cold such as
had never been experienced by human beings. We had
been out for four weeks under conditions in which no man
had existed previously for more than a few days, if that.
During this time we had seldom slept except from sheer
physical exhaustion, as men sleep on the rack; and every
minute of it we had been fighting for the bed-rock necessaries
of bare existence, and always in the dark. We had
kept ourselves going by enormous care of our feet and
hands and bodies, by burning oil, and by having plenty of
hot fatty food. Now we had no tent, one tin of oil left out
of six, and only part of our cooker. When we were lucky
and not too cold we could almost wring water from our
clothes, and directly we got out of our sleeping-bags we
were frozen into solid sheets of armoured ice. In cold
temperatures with all the advantages of a tent over our
heads we were already taking more than an hour of fierce
struggling and cramp to get into our sleeping-bags&mdash;so
frozen were they and so long did it take us to thaw our way
in. No! Without the tent we were dead men.</p>

<hr />


<p>And there seemed not one chance in a million that we
should ever see our tent again. We were 900 feet up on
the mountain side, and the wind blew about as hard as a
wind can blow straight out to sea. First there was a steep
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>slope, so hard that a pick made little impression upon it,
so slippery that if you started down in finnesko you never
could stop: this ended in a great ice-cliff some hundreds
of feet high, and then came miles of pressure ridges,
crevassed and tumbled, in which you might as well look
for a daisy as a tent: and after that the open sea. The
chances, however, were that the tent had just been taken
up into the air and dropped somewhere in this sea well on
the way to New Zealand. Obviously the tent was gone.</p>

<p>Face to face with real death one does not think of the
things that torment the bad people in the tracts, and fill
the good people with bliss. I might have speculated on
my chances of going to Heaven; but candidly I did not
care. I could not have wept if I had tried. I had no wish
to review the evils of my past. But the past did seem to
have been a bit wasted. The road to Hell may be paved
with good intentions: the road to Heaven is paved with
lost opportunities.</p>

<p>I wanted those years over again. What fun I would have
with them: what glorious fun! It was a pity. Well has
the Persian said that when we come to die we, remembering
that God is merciful, will gnaw our elbows with remorse
for thinking of the things we have not done for fear
of the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>And I wanted peaches and syrup&mdash;badly. We had
them at the hut, sweeter and more luscious than you can
imagine. And we had been without sugar for a month.
Yes&mdash;especially the syrup.</p>

<p>Thus impiously I set out to die, making up my mind
that I was not going to try and keep warm, that it might
not take too long, and thinking I would try and get some
morphia from the medical case if it got very bad. Not a bit
heroic, and entirely true! Yes! comfortable, warm reader.
Men do not fear death, they fear the pain of dying.</p>

<p>And then quite naturally and no doubt disappointingly
to those who would like to read of my last agonies (for
who would not give pleasure by his death?) I fell asleep. I
expect the temperature was pretty high during this great
blizzard, and anything near zero was very high to us.<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>
That and the snow which drifted over us made a pleasant
wet kind of snipe marsh inside our sleeping-bags, and I
am sure we all dozed a good bit. There was so much to
worry about that there was not the least use in worrying;
and we were so <i>very</i> tired. We were hungry, for the last
meal we had had was in the morning of the day before, but
hunger was not very pressing.</p>

<p>And so we lay, wet and quite fairly warm, hour after
hour while the wind roared round us, blowing storm force
continually and rising in the gusts to something indescribable.
Storm force is force 11, and force 12 is the
biggest wind which can be logged: Bowers logged it force
11, but he was always so afraid of overestimating that he
was inclined to underrate. I think it was blowing a full
hurricane. Sometimes awake, sometimes dozing, we had
not a very uncomfortable time so far as I can remember.
I knew that parties which had come to Cape Crozier in the
spring had experienced blizzards which lasted eight or ten
days. But this did not worry us as much as I think it did
Bill: I was numb. I vaguely called to mind that Peary had
survived a blizzard in the open: but wasn't that in the
summer?</p>

<p>It was in the early morning of Saturday (July 22) that
we discovered the loss of the tent. Some time during that
morning we had had our last meal. The roof went about
noon on Sunday and we had had no meal in the interval
because our supply of oil was so low; nor could we move
out of our bags except as a last necessity. By Sunday night
we had been without a meal for some thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>The rocks which fell upon us when the roof went did
no damage, and though we could not get out of our bags to
move them, we could fit ourselves into them without difficulty.
More serious was the drift which began to pile up
all round and over us. It helped to keep us warm of course,
but at the same time in these comparatively high temperatures
it saturated our bags even worse than they were before.
If we did not find the tent (and its recovery would
be a miracle) these bags and the floor-cloth of the tent on
which we were lying were all we had in that fight back
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>across the Barrier which could, I suppose, have only had
one end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we had to wait. It was nearly 70 miles home
and it had taken us the best part of three weeks to come. In
our less miserable moments we tried to think out ways of
getting back, but I do not remember very much about that
time. Sunday morning faded into Sunday afternoon,&mdash;into
Sunday night,&mdash;into Monday morning. Till then the
blizzard had raged with monstrous fury; the winds of the
world were there, and they had all gone mad. We had bad
winds at Cape Evans this year, and we had far worse the
next winter when the open water was at our doors. But I
have never heard or felt or seen a wind like this. I wondered
why it did not carry away the earth.</p>

<p>In the early hours of Monday there was an occasional
hint of a lull. Ordinarily in a big winter blizzard, when
you have lived for several days and nights with that turmoil
in your ears, the lulls are more trying than the noise:
&quot;the feel of not to feel it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> I do not remember noticing
that now. Seven or eight more hours passed, and though
it was still blowing we could make ourselves heard to one
another without great difficulty. It was two days and two
nights since we had had a meal.</p>

<p>We decided to get out of our bags and make a search
for the tent. We did so, bitterly cold and utterly miserable,
though I do not think any of us showed it. In the darkness
we could see very little, and no trace whatever of the
tent. We returned against the wind, nursing our faces and
hands, and settled that we must try and cook a meal somehow.
We managed about the weirdest meal eaten north
or south. We got the floor-cloth wedged under our bags,
then got into our bags and drew the floor-cloth over our
heads. Between us we got the primus alight somehow,
and by hand we balanced the cooker on top of it, minus
the two members which had been blown away. The flame
flickered in the draughts. Very slowly the snow in the
cooker melted, we threw in a plentiful supply of pemmican,
and the smell of it was better than anything on
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>earth. In time we got both tea and pemmican, which was
full of hairs from our bags, penguin feathers, dirt and
debris, but delicious. The blubber left in the cooker got
burnt and gave the tea a burnt taste. None of us ever forgot
that meal: I enjoyed it as much as such a meal could
be enjoyed, and that burnt taste will always bring back the
memory.</p>

<p>It was still dark and we lay down in our bags again, but
soon a little glow of light began to come up, and we turned
out to have a further search for the tent. Birdie went off
before Bill and me. Clumsily I dragged my eider-down out
of my bag on my feet, all sopping wet: it was impossible
to get it back and I let it freeze: it was soon just like a
rock. The sky to the south was as black and sinister as it
could possibly be. It looked as though the blizzard would
be on us again at any moment.</p>

<p>I followed Bill down the slope. We could find nothing.
But, as we searched, we heard a shout somewhere below
and to the right. We got on a slope, slipped, and went sliding
down quite unable to stop ourselves, and came upon
Birdie with the tent, the outer lining still on the bamboos.
Our lives had been taken away and given back to us.</p>

<p>We were so thankful we said nothing.</p>

<p>The tent must have been gripped up into the air,
shutting as it rose. The bamboos, with the inner lining
lashed to them, had entangled the outer cover, and the
whole went up together like a shut umbrella. This was
our salvation. If it had opened in the air nothing could
have prevented its destruction. As it was, with all the
accumulated ice upon it, it must have weighed the best
part of 100 lbs. It had been dropped about half a mile
away, at the bottom of a steep slope: and it fell in a
hollow, still shut up. The main force of the wind had
passed over it, and there it was, with the bamboos and
fastenings wrenched and strained, and the ends of two of
the poles broken, but the silk untorn.</p>

<p>If that tent went again we were going with it. We
made our way back up the slope with it, carrying it
solemnly and reverently, precious as though it were some<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>thing
not quite of the earth. And we dug it in as tent was
never dug in before; not by the igloo, but in the old place
farther down where we had first arrived. And while Bill
was doing this Birdie and I went back to the igloo and dug
and scratched and shook away the drift inside until we had
found nearly all our gear. It is wonderful how little we
lost when the roof went. Most of our gear was hung on
the sledge, which was part of the roof, or was packed into
the holes of the hut to try and make it drift-proof, and the
things must have been blown inwards into the bottom of
the hut by the wind from the south and the back draught
from the north. Then they were all drifted up. Of course
a certain number of mitts and socks were blown away and
lost, but the only important things were Bill's fur mitts,
which were stuffed into a hole in the rocks of the hut.
We loaded up the sledge and pushed it down the slope.
I don't know how Birdie was feeling, but I felt so weak
that it was the greatest labour. The blizzard looked right
on top of us.</p>

<p>We had another meal, and we wanted it: and as the
good hoosh ran down into our feet and hands, and up into
our cheeks and ears and brains, we discussed what we
would do next. Birdie was all for another go at the
Emperor penguins. Dear Birdie, he never would admit
that he was beaten&mdash;I don't know that he ever really was!
&quot;I think he (Wilson) thought he had landed us in a bad
corner and was determined to go straight home, though I
was for one other tap at the Rookery. However, I had
placed myself under his orders for this trip voluntarily, and
so we started the next day for home.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> There could really
be no common-sense doubt: we had to go back, and we
were already very doubtful whether we should ever manage
to get into our sleeping-bags in very low temperature,
so ghastly had they become.</p>

<p>I don't know when it was, but I remember walking
down that slope&mdash;I don't know why, perhaps to try and
find the bottom of the cooker&mdash;and thinking that there
was nothing on earth that a man under such circum<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>stances
would not give for a good warm sleep. He would
give everything he possessed: he would give&mdash;how many&mdash;years
of his life. One or two at any rate&mdash;perhaps
five? Yes&mdash;I would give five. I remember the sastrugi,
the view of the Knoll, the dim hazy black smudge of the
sea far away below: the tiny bits of green canvas that
twittered in the wind on the surface of the snow: the
cold misery of it all, and the weakness which was biting
into my heart.</p>

<p>For days Birdie had been urging me to use his eider-down
lining&mdash;his beautiful dry bag of the finest down&mdash;which
he had never slipped into his own fur bag. I had
refused: I felt that I should be a beast to take it.</p>

<p>We packed the tank ready for a start back in the
morning and turned in, utterly worn out. It was only
-12&deg; that night, but my left big toe was frost-bitten in my
bag which I was trying to use without an eider-down lining,
and my bag was always too big for me. It must have taken
several hours to get it back, by beating one foot against the
other. When we got up, as soon as we could, as we did
every night, for our bags were nearly impossible, it was
blowing fairly hard and looked like blizzing. We had a
lot to do, two or three hours' work, packing sledges and
making a dep&ocirc;t of what we did not want, in a corner of the
igloo. We left the second sledge, and a note tied to the
handle of the pickaxe.</p>

<p>&quot;We started down the slope in a wind which was
rising all the time and -15&deg;. My job was to balance
the sledge behind: I was so utterly done I don't believe
I could have pulled effectively. Birdie was much the
strongest of us. The strain and want of sleep was getting
me in the neck, and Bill looked very bad. At the bottom
we turned our faces to the Barrier, our backs to the penguins,
but after doing about a mile it looked so threatening
in the south that we camped in a big wind, our hands
going one after the other. We had nothing but the
hardest wind-swept sastrugi, and it was a long business:
there was only the smallest amount of drift, and we were
afraid the icy snow blocks would chafe the tent. Birdie
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>lashed the full biscuit tin to the door to prevent its flapping,
and also got what he called the tent downhaul round the
cap and then tied it about himself outside his bag: if the
tent went he was going too.</p>

<p>&quot;I was feeling as if I should crack, and accepted Birdie's
eider-down. It was wonderfully self-sacrificing of him:
more than I can write. I felt a brute to take it, but I was
getting useless unless I got some sleep which my big bag
would not allow. Bill and Birdie kept on telling me to do
less: that I was doing more than my share of the work:
but I think that I was getting more and more weak. Birdie
kept wonderfully strong: he slept most of the night: the
difficulty for him was to get into his bag without going
to sleep. He kept the meteorological log untiringly, but
some of these nights he had to give it up for the time because
he could not keep awake. He used to fall asleep with
his pannikin in his hand and let it fall: and sometimes he
had the primus.</p>

<p>&quot;Bill's bag was getting hopeless: it was really too small
for an eider-down and was splitting all over the place:
great long holes. He never consciously slept for nights:
he did sleep a bit, for we heard him. Except for this night,
and the next when Birdie's eider-down was still fairly dry,
I never consciously slept; except that I used to wake for
five or six nights running with the same nightmare&mdash;that
we were drifted up, and that Bill and Birdie were passing
the gear into my bag, cutting it open to do so, or some other
variation,&mdash;I did not know that I had been asleep at all.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>&quot;We had hardly reached the pit,&quot; wrote Bowers,
&quot;when a furious wind came on again and we had to camp.
All that night the tent flapped like the noise of musketry,
owing to two poles having been broken at the ends and the
fit spoilt. I thought it would end matters by going altogether
and lashed it down as much as I could, attaching the
apex to a line round my own bag. The wind abated after
1&frac12; days and we set out, doing five or six miles before we
found ourselves among crevasses.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>We had plugged ahead all that day (July 26) in a ter<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>rible
light, blundering in among pressure and up on to the
slopes of Terror. The temperature dropped from -21&deg; to
-45&deg;. &quot;Several times [we] stepped into rotten-lidded
crevasses in smooth wind-swept ice. We continued, however,
feeling our way along by keeping always off hard ice-slopes
and on the crustier deeper snow which characterizes
the hollows of the pressure ridges, which I believed we had
once more fouled in the dark. We had no light, and no
landmarks to guide us, except vague and indistinct silhouetted
slopes ahead, which were always altering and
whose distance and character it was impossible to judge.
We never knew whether we were approaching a steep
slope at close quarters or a long slope of Terror, miles
away, and eventually we travelled on by the ear, and by the
feel of the snow under our feet, for both the sound and the
touch told one much of the chances of crevasses or of safe
going. We continued thus in the dark in the hope that we
were at any rate in the right direction.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> And then we
camped after getting into a bunch of crevasses, completely
lost. Bill said, &quot;At any rate I think we are well clear of
the pressure.&quot; But there were pressure pops all night, as
though some one was whacking an empty tub.</p>

<p>It was Birdie's picture hat which made the trouble next
day. &quot;What do you think of <i>that</i> for a hat, sir?&quot; I heard
him say to Scott a few days before we started, holding it
out much as Lucille displays her latest Paris model. Scott
looked at it quietly for a time: &quot;I'll tell you when you
come back, Birdie,&quot; he said. It was a complicated affair
with all kinds of nose-guards and buttons and lanyards:
he thought he was going to set it to suit the wind much as
he would set the sails of a ship. We spent a long time with
our housewifes before this and other trips, for everybody
has their own ideas as to how to alter their clothing for the
best. When finished some looked neat, like Bill: others
baggy, like Scott or Seaman Evans: others rough and
ready, like Oates and Bowers: a few perhaps more rough
than ready, and I will not mention names. Anyway Birdie's
hat became improper immediately it was well iced up.<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></p>

<p>&quot;When we got a little light in the morning we found
we were a little north of the two patches of moraine on
Terror. Though we did not know it, we were on the point
where the pressure runs up against Terror, and we could
dimly see that we were right up against something. We
started to try and clear it, but soon had an enormous ridge,
blotting out the moraine and half Terror, rising like a
great hill on our right. Bill said the only thing was to go
right on and hope it would lower; all the time, however,
there was a bad feeling that we might be putting any
number of ridges between us and the mountain. After a
while we tried to cross this one, but had to turn back for
crevasses, both Bill and I putting a leg down. We went on
for about twenty minutes and found a lower place, and
turned to rise up it diagonally, and reached the top. Just
over the top Birdie went right down a crevasse, which was
about wide enough to take him. He was out of sight and
out of reach from the surface, hanging in his harness.
Bill went for his harness, I went for the bow of the sledge:
Bill told me to get the Alpine rope and Birdie directed
from below what we could do. We could not possibly haul
him up as he was, for the sides of the crevasse were soft
and he could not help himself.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>&quot;My helmet was so frozen up,&quot; wrote Bowers, &quot;that
my head was encased in a solid block of ice, and I could
not look down without inclining my whole body. As a
result Bill stumbled one foot into a crevasse and I landed
in it with both mine [even as I shouted a warning<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> ], the
bridge gave way and down I went. Fortunately our sledge
harness is made with a view to resisting this sort of thing,
and there I hung with the bottomless pit below and the ice-crusted
sides alongside, so narrow that to step over it
would have been quite easy had I been able to see it. Bill
said, 'What do you want?' I asked for an Alpine rope
with a bowline for my foot: and taking up first the bowline
and then my harness they got me out.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Meanwhile
on the surface I lay over the crevasse and gave Birdie the
bowline: he put it on his foot: then he raised his foot,
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>giving me some slack: I held the rope while he raised
himself on his foot, thus giving Bill some slack on the
harness: Bill then held the harness, allowing Birdie to
raise his foot and give me some slack again. We got him
up inch by inch, our fingers getting bitten, for the temperature
was -46&deg;. Afterwards we often used this way of
getting people out of crevasses, and it was a wonderful
piece of presence of mind that it was invented, so far as I
know, on the spur of the moment by a frozen man hanging
in one himself.</p>

<p>&quot;In front of us we could see another ridge, and we did
not know how many lay beyond that. Things looked
pretty bad. Bill took a long lead on the Alpine rope and we
got down our present difficulty all right. This method of
the leader being on a long trace in front we all agreed to
be very useful. From this moment our luck changed and
everything went for us to the end. When we went out on
the sea-ice the whole experience was over in a few days,
Hut Point was always in sight, and there was daylight. I
always had the feeling that the whole series of events had
been brought about by an extraordinary run of accidents,
and that after a certain stage it was quite beyond our power
to guide the course of them. When on the way to Cape
Crozier the moon suddenly came out of the cloud to show
us a great crevasse which would have taken us all with our
sledge without any difficulty, I felt that we were not to go
under this trip after such a deliverance. When we had lost
our tent, and there was a very great balance of probability
that we should never find it again, and we were lying out
the blizzard in our bags, I saw that we were face to face with
a long fight against cold which we could not have survived.
I cannot write how helpless I believed we were to help ourselves,
and how we were brought out of a very terrible
series of experiences. When we started back I had a feeling
that things were going to change for the better, and this
day I had a distinct idea that we were to have one more bad
experience and that after that we could hope for better
things.</p>

<hr />


<p>&quot;By running along the hollow we cleared the pressure
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>ridges, and continued all day up and down, but met no
crevasses. Indeed, we met no more crevasses and no more
pressure. I think it was upon this day that a wonderful
glow stretched over the Barrier edge from Cape Crozier:
at the base it was the most vivid crimson it is possible to
imagine, shading upwards through every shade of red to
light green, and so into a deep blue sky. It is the most
vivid red I have ever seen in the sky.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>It was -49&deg; in the night and we were away early in
-47&deg;. By mid-day we were rising Terror Point, opening
Erebus rapidly, and got the first really light day, though
the sun would not appear over the horizon for another
month. I cannot describe what a relief the light was to us.
We crossed the point outside our former track, and saw
inside us the ridges where we had been blizzed for three
days on our outward journey.</p>

<p>The minimum was -66&deg; the next night and we were
now back in the windless bight of Barrier with its soft snow,
low temperatures, fogs and mists, and lingering settlements
of the inside crusts. Saturday and Sunday, the 29th
and 30th, we plugged on across this waste, iced up as usual
but always with Castle Rock getting bigger. Sometimes it
looked like fog or wind, but it always cleared away. We were
getting weak, how weak we can only realize now, but we
got in good marches, though slow&mdash;days when we did 4&frac12;,
7&frac14; 6&frac34;, 6&frac12;, 7&frac12; miles. On our outward journey we had been
relaying and getting forward about 4&frac12; miles a day at this
point. The surface which we had dreaded so much was
not so sandy or soft as when we had come out, and the settlements
were more marked. These are caused by a crust
falling under your feet. Generally the area involved is some
twenty yards or so round you, and the surface falls through
an air space for two or three inches with a soft 'crush'
which may at first make you think there are crevasses
about. In the region where we now travelled they were
much more pronounced than elsewhere, and one day, when
Bill was inside the tent lighting the primus, I put my foot
into a hole that I had dug. This started a big settlement;
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>sledge, tent and all of us dropped about a foot, and the
noise of it ran away for miles and miles: we listened to it
until we began to get too cold. It must have lasted a full
three minutes.</p>

<p>In the pauses of our marching we halted in our harnesses
the ropes of which lay slack in the powdery snow.
We stood panting with our backs against the mountainous
mass of frozen gear which was our load. There was no
wind, at any rate no more than light airs: our breath
crackled as it froze. There was no unnecessary conversation:
I don't know why our tongues never got frozen, but
all my teeth, the nerves of which had been killed, split to
pieces. We had been going perhaps three hours since
lunch.</p>

<p>&quot;How are your feet, Cherry?&quot; from Bill.</p>

<p>&quot;Very cold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's all right; so are mine.&quot; We didn't worry to
ask Birdie: he never had a frost-bitten foot from start to
finish.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, as we marched, Bill would ask the
same question. I tell him that all feeling has gone: Bill still
has some feeling in one of his but the other is lost. He
settled we had better camp: another ghastly night ahead.
We started to get out of our harnesses, while Bill, before
doing anything else, would take the fur mitts from his hands,
carefully shape any soft parts as they froze (generally,
however, our mitts did not thaw on our hands), and lay
them on the snow in front of him&mdash;two dark dots. His
proper fur mitts were lost when the igloo roof went: these
were the delicate dog-skin linings we had in addition,
beautiful things to look at and to feel when new, excellent
when dry to turn the screws of a theodolite, but too dainty
for straps and lanyards. Just now I don't know what he
could have done without them.</p>

<p>Working with our woollen half-mitts and mitts on our
hands all the time, and our fur mitts over them when
possible, we gradually got the buckles undone, and spread
the green canvas floor-cloth on the snow. This was also
fitted to be used as a sail, but we never could have rigged a
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>sail on this journey. The shovel and the bamboos, with a
lining, itself lined with ice, lashed to them, were packed on
the top of the load and were now put on the snow until
wanted. Our next job was to lift our three sleeping-bags
one by one on to the floor-cloth: they covered it, bulging
over the sides&mdash;those obstinate coffins which were all our
life to us.... One of us is off by now to nurse his fingers
back. The cooker was unlashed from the top of the instrument
box; some parts of it were put on the bags with the
primus, methylated spirit can, matches and so forth; others
left to be filled with snow later. Taking a pole in each hand
we three spread the bamboos over the whole. &quot;All right?
Down!&quot; from Bill; and we lowered them gently on to the
soft snow, that they might not sink too far. The ice on
the inner lining of the tent was formed mostly from the
steam of the cooker. This we had been unable to beat or
chip off in the past, and we were now, truth to tell, past
worrying about it. The little ventilator in the top, made
to let out this steam, had been tied up in order to keep in
all possible heat. Then over with the outer cover, and for
one of us the third worst job of the day was to begin.
The worst job was to get into our bags: the second or equal
worst was to lie in them for six hours (we had brought
it down to six): this third worst was, to get the primus
lighted and a meal on the way.</p>

<p>As cook of the day you took the broken metal framework,
all that remained of our candlestick, and got yourself
with difficulty into the funnel which formed the door.
The enclosed space of the tent seemed much colder than
the outside air: you tried three or four match-boxes and
no match would strike: almost desperate, you asked for a
new box to be given you from the sledge and got a light
from this because it had not yet been in the warmth, so
called, of the tent. The candle hung by a wire from the cap
of the tent. It would be tedious to tell of the times we had
getting the primus alight, and the lanyards of the weekly
food bag unlashed. Probably by now the other two men
have dug in the tent; squared up outside; filled and passed
in the cooker; set the thermometer under the sledge and
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>so forth. There were always one or two odd jobs which
wanted doing as well: but you may be sure they came in
as soon as possible when they heard the primus hissing,
and saw the glow of light inside. Birdie made a bottom
for the cooker out of an empty biscuit tin to take the place
of the part which was blown away. On the whole this was
a success, but we had to hold it steady&mdash;on Bill's sleeping-bag,
for the flat frozen bags spread all over the floor space.
Cooking was a longer business now. Some one whacked
out the biscuit, and the cook put the ration of pemmican
into the inner cooker which was by now half full of
water. As opportunity offered we got out of our day, and
into our night foot-gear&mdash;fleecy camel-hair stockings and
fur boots. In the dim light we examined our feet for frost-bite.</p>

<p>I do not think it took us less than an hour to get a hot
meal to our lips: pemmican followed by hot water in
which we soaked our biscuits. For lunch we had tea and
biscuits: for breakfast, pemmican, biscuits and tea. We
could not have managed more food bags&mdash;three were
bad enough, and the lashings of everything were like
wire. The lashing of the tent door, however, was the
worst, and it <i>had</i> to be tied tightly, especially if it was
blowing. In the early days we took great pains to brush
rime from the tent before packing it up, but we were long
past that now.</p>

<p>The hoosh got down into our feet: we nursed back
frost-bites: and we were all the warmer for having got our
dry foot-gear on before supper. Then we started to get into
our bags.</p>

<hr />


<p>Birdie's bag fitted him beautifully, though perhaps it
would have been a little small with an eider-down inside.
He must have had a greater heat supply than other men;
for he never had serious trouble with his feet, while ours
were constantly frost-bitten: he slept, I should be afraid
to say how much, longer than we did, even in these last
days: it was a pleasure, lying awake practically all night,
to hear his snores. He turned his bag inside out from fur
to skin, and skin to fur, many times during the journey,
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>and thus got rid of a lot of moisture which came out as
snow or actual knobs of ice. When we did turn our bags
the only way was to do so directly we turned out, and even
then you had to be quick before the bag froze. Getting out
of the tent at night it was quite a race to get back to your
bag before it hardened. Of course this was in the lowest
temperatures.</p>

<p>We could not burn our bags and we tried putting the
lighted primus into them to thaw them out, but this was
not very successful. Before this time, when it was very
cold, we lighted the primus in the morning while we were
still in our bags: and in the evening we kept it going
until we were just getting or had got the mouths of our
bags levered open. But returning we had no oil for such
luxuries, until the last day or two.</p>

<p>I do not believe that any man, however sick he is, has
a much worse time than we had in those bags, shaking with
cold until our backs would almost break. One of the added
troubles which came to us on our return was the sodden
condition of our hands in our bags at night. We had to
wear our mitts and half-mitts, and they were as wet as they
could be: when we got up in the morning we had washer-women's
hands&mdash;white, crinkled, sodden. That was an unhealthy
way to start the day's work. We really wanted
some bags of saennegrass for hands as well as feet; one of
the blessings of that kind of bag being that you can shake
the moisture from it: but we only had enough for our
wretched feet.</p>

<p>The horrors of that return journey are blurred to my
memory and I know they were blurred to my body at the
time. I think this applies to all of us, for we were much
weakened and callous. The day we got down to the penguins
I had not cared whether I fell into a crevasse or not.
We had been through a great deal since then. I know that
we slept on the march; for I woke up when I bumped
against Birdie, and Birdie woke when he bumped against
me. I think Bill steering out in front managed to keep
awake. I know we fell asleep if we waited in the comparatively
warm tent when the primus was alight&mdash;with our
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>pannikins or the primus in our hands. I know that our
sleeping-bags were so full of ice that we did not worry if
we spilt water or hoosh over them as they lay on the floor-cloth,
when we cooked on them with our maimed cooker.
They were so bad that we never rolled them up in the usual
way when we got out of them in the morning: we opened
their mouths as much as possible before they froze, and
hoisted them more or less flat on to the sledge. All three
of us helped to raise each bag, which looked rather like a
squashed coffin and was probably a good deal harder. I
know that if it was only -40&deg; when we camped for the
night we considered quite seriously that we were going to
have a warm one, and that when we got up in the morning
if the temperature was in the minus sixties we did not
enquire what it was. The day's march was bliss compared
to the night's rest, and both were awful. We were about as
bad as men can be and do good travelling: but I never
heard a word of complaint, nor, I believe, an oath, and I
saw self-sacrifice standing every test.</p>

<p>Always we were getting nearer home: and we were
doing good marches. We were going to pull through; it
was only a matter of sticking this for a few more days;
six, five, four ... three perhaps now, if we were not
blizzed. Our main hut was behind that ridge where the
mist was always forming and blowing away, and there was
Castle Rock: we might even see Observation Hill to-morrow,
and the Discovery Hut furnished and trim was
behind it, and they would have sent some dry sleeping-bags
from Cape Evans to greet us there. We reckoned our
troubles over at the Barrier edge, and assuredly it was not
far away. &quot;You've got it in the neck, stick it, you've got
it in the neck&quot;&mdash;it was always running in my head.</p>

<p>And we <i>did</i> stick it. How good the memories of those
days are. With jokes about Birdie's picture hat: with
songs we remembered off the gramophone: with ready
words of sympathy for frost-bitten feet: with generous
smiles for poor jests: with suggestions of happy beds to
come. We did not forget the Please and Thank you,
which mean much in such circumstances, and all the little
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>links with decent civilization which we could still keep
going. I'll swear there was still a grace about us when we
staggered in. And we kept our tempers&mdash;even with God.</p>

<p>We <i>might</i> reach Hut Point to-night: we were burning
more oil now, that one-gallon tin had lasted us well: and
burning more candle too; at one time we feared they
would give out. A hell of a morning we had: -57&deg; in our
present state. But it was calm, and the Barrier edge could
not be much farther now. The surface was getting harder:
there were a few wind-blown furrows, the crust was coming
up to us. The sledge was dragging easier: we always suspected
the Barrier sloped downwards hereabouts. Now
the hard snow was on the surface, peeping out like great
inverted basins on which we slipped, and our feet became
warmer for not sinking into soft snow. Suddenly we saw
a gleam of light in a line of darkness running across our
course. It was the Barrier edge: we were all right now.</p>

<p>We ran the sledge off a snow-drift on to the sea-ice,
with the same cold stream of air flowing down it which
wrecked my hands five weeks ago: pushed out of this,
camped and had a meal: the temperature had already
risen to -43&deg;. We could almost feel it getting warmer as
we went round Cape Armitage on the last three miles. We
managed to haul our sledge up the ice foot, and dug the
drift away from the door. The old hut struck us as fairly
warm.</p>

<p>Bill was convinced that we ought not to go into the
warm hut at Cape Evans when we arrived there&mdash;to-morrow
night! We ought to get back to warmth gradually,
live in a tent outside, or in the annexe for a day or two.
But I'm sure we never meant to do it. Just now Hut Point
did not prejudice us in favour of such abstinence. It was
just as we had left it: there was nothing sent down for us
there&mdash;no sleeping-bags, nor sugar: but there was plenty
of oil. Inside the hut we pitched a dry tent left there since
Dep&ocirc;t Journey days, set two primuses going in it; sat dozing
on our bags; and drank cocoa without sugar so thick
that next morning we were gorged with it. We were very
happy, falling asleep between each mouthful, and after
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>several hours discussed schemes of not getting into our
bags at all. But some one would have to keep the primus
going to prevent frost-bite, and we could not trust ourselves
to keep awake. Bill and I tried to sing a part-song.
Finally we sopped our way into our bags. We only stuck
<i>them</i> three hours, and thankfully turned out at 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
and were ready to pack up when we heard the wind come
away. It was no good, so we sat in our tent and dozed
again. The wind dropped at 9.30: we were off at 11.
We walked out into what seemed to us a blaze of light.
It was not until the following year that I understood that
a great part of such twilight as there is in the latter part of
the winter was cut off from us by the mountains under
which we travelled. Now, with nothing between us and
the northern horizon below which lay the sun, we saw as
we had not seen for months, and the iridescent clouds that
day were beautiful.</p>

<p>We just pulled for all we were worth and did nearly
two miles an hour: for two miles a baddish salt surface,
then big undulating hard sastrugi and good going. We
slept as we walked. We had done eight miles by 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
and were past Glacier Tongue. We lunched there.</p>

<p>As we began to gather our gear together to pack up for
the last time, Bill said quietly, &quot;I want to thank you two
for what you have done. I couldn't have found two better
companions&mdash;and what is more I never shall.&quot;</p>

<p>I am proud of that.</p>

<p>Antarctic exploration is seldom as bad as you imagine,
seldom as bad as it sounds. But this journey had beggared
our language: no words could express its horror.</p>

<p>We trudged on for several more hours and it grew very
dark. There was a discussion as to where Cape Evans lay.
We rounded it at last: it must have been ten or eleven
o'clock, and it was possible that some one might see us as
we pulled towards the hut. &quot;Spread out well,&quot; said Bill,
&quot;and they will be able to see that there are three men.&quot;
But we pulled along the cape, over the tide-crack, up the
bank to the very door of the hut without a sound. No
noise from the stable, nor the bark of a dog from the snow<a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>drifts
above us. We halted and stood there trying to get
ourselves and one another out of our frozen harnesses&mdash;the
usual long job. The door opened&mdash;&quot;Good God! here
is the Crozier Party,&quot; said a voice, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Thus ended the worst journey in the world.</p>

<p>And now the reader will ask what became of the three
penguins' eggs for which three human lives had been
risked three hundred times a day, and three human frames
strained to the utmost extremity of human endurance.</p>

<p>Let us leave the Antarctic for a moment and conceive
ourselves in the year 1913 in the Natural History Museum
in South Kensington. I had written to say that I would
bring the eggs at this time. Present, myself, C.-G., the sole
survivor of the three, with First or Doorstep Custodian of
the Sacred Eggs. I did not take a verbatim report of his
welcome; but the spirit of it may be dramatized as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Custodian</span>. Who are you? What do you want?
This ain't an egg-shop. What call have you to come
meddling with our eggs? Do you want me to put the
police on to you? Is it the crocodile's egg you're after?
I don't know nothing about 'no eggs. You'd best speak
to Mr. Brown: it's him that varnishes the eggs.</p>

<p>I resort to Mr. Brown, who ushers me into the presence
of the Chief Custodian, a man of scientific aspect, with two
manners: one, affably courteous, for a Person of Importance
(I guess a Naturalist Rothschild at least) with whom
he is conversing, and the other, extraordinarily offensive
even for an official man of science, for myself.</p>

<p>I announce myself with becoming modesty as the
bearer of the penguins' eggs, and proffer them. The Chief
Custodian takes them into custody without a word of
thanks, and turns to the Person of Importance to discuss
them. I wait. The temperature of my blood rises. The
conversation proceeds for what seems to me a considerable
period. Suddenly the Chief Custodian notices my presence
and seems to resent it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chief Custodian</span>. You needn't wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heroic Explorer</span>. I should like to have a receipt for
the eggs, if you please.<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chief Custodian</span>. It is not necessary: it is all right.
You needn't wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heroic Explorer</span>. I should like to have a receipt.</p>

<p>But by this time the Chief Custodian's attention is
again devoted wholly to the Person of Importance. Feeling
that to persist in overhearing their conversation would
be an indelicacy, the Heroic Explorer politely leaves the
room, and establishes himself on a chair in a gloomy passage
outside, where he wiles away the time by rehearsing
in his imagination how he will tell off the Chief Custodian
when the Person of Importance retires. But this the
Person of Importance shows no sign of doing, and the
Explorer's thoughts and intentions become darker and
darker. As the day wears on, minor officials, passing to
and from the Presence, look at him doubtfully and ask his
business. The reply is always the same, &quot;I am waiting
for a receipt for some penguins' eggs.&quot; At last it becomes
clear from the Explorer's expression that what he is
really waiting for is not to take a receipt but to commit
murder. Presumably this is reported to the destined
victim: at all events the receipt finally comes; and the
Explorer goes his way with it, feeling that he has behaved
like a perfect gentleman, but so very dissatisfied with that
vapid consolation that for hours he continues his imaginary
rehearsals of what he would have liked to have done to
that Custodian (mostly with his boots) by way of teaching
him manners.</p>

<p>Some time after this I visited the Natural History
Museum with Captain Scott's sister. After a slight preliminary
skirmish in which we convinced a minor custodian
that the specimens brought by the expedition from
the Antarctic did not include the moths we found preying
on some of them, Miss Scott expressed a wish to see the
penguins' eggs. Thereupon the minor custodians flatly
denied that any such eggs were in existence or in their
possession. Now Miss Scott was her brother's sister;
and she showed so little disposition to take this lying down
that I was glad to get her away with no worse consequences
than a profanely emphasized threat on my part that if we
did not receive ample satisfaction in writing within twenty-four
hours as to the safety of the eggs England would
reverberate with the tale.</p>

<p>The ultimatum was effectual; and due satisfaction
was forthcoming in time; but I was relieved when I
learnt later on that they had been entrusted to Professor
Assheton for the necessary microscopic examination. But
he died before he could approach the task; and the eggs
passed into the hands of Professor Cossar Ewart of Edinburgh
University.</p>

<p>His report is as follows:</p>



<hr class="full" />
<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Professor Cossar Ewart's Report</span></h3>


<p>&quot;It was a great disappointment to Dr. Wilson that
no Emperor Penguin embryos were obtained during the
cruise of the Discovery. But though embryos were conspicuous
by their absence in the Emperor eggs brought
home by the National Antarctic Expedition, it is well to
bear in mind that the naturalists on board the Discovery
learned much about the breeding habits of the largest
living member of the ancient penguin family. Amongst
other things it was ascertained (1) that in the case of the
Emperor, as in the King Penguin, the egg during the
period of incubation rests on the upper surface of the feet
protected and kept in position by a fold of skin from the
lower breast; and (2) that in the case of the Emperor the
whole process of incubation is carried out on sea ice during
the coldest and darkest months of the antarctic winter.</p>

<p>&quot;After devoting much time to the study of penguins
Dr. Wilson came to the conclusion that Emperor embryos
would throw new light on the origin and history of birds,
and decided that if he again found his way to the Antarctic
he would make a supreme effort to visit an Emperor
rookery during the breeding season. When, and under
what conditions, the Cape Crozier rookery was eventually
visited and Emperor eggs secured is graphically told in
The Winter Journey. The question now arises, Has 'the
weirdest bird's-nesting expedition that has ever been made'
added appreciably to our knowledge of birds?</p>

<p>&quot;It is admitted that birds are descended from bipedal
reptiles which flourished some millions of years ago&mdash;reptiles
in build not unlike the kangaroo. From Archaeopteryx
of Jurassic times we know primeval birds had teeth,
three fingers with claws on each hand, and a long lizard-like
tail provided with nearly twenty pairs of well-formed true
feathers. But unfortunately neither this lizard-tailed bird,
nor yet the fossil birds found in America, throw any light
on the origin of feathers. Ornithologists and others who
have devoted much time to the study of birds have as a
rule assumed that feathers were made out of scales, that
the scales along the margin of the hand and forearm and
along each side of the tail were elongated, frayed and otherwise
modified to form the wing and tail quills, and that
later other scales were altered to provide a coat capable of
preventing loss of heat. But as it happens, a study of the
development of feathers affords no evidence that they were
made out of scales. There are neither rudiments of scales
nor feathers in very young bird embryos. In the youngest
of the three Emperor embryos there are, however, feather
rudiments in the tail region,&mdash;the embryo was probably
seven or eight days old&mdash;but in the two older embryos
there are a countless number of feather rudiments, <i>i.e.</i> of
minute pimples known as papillae.</p>

<p>&quot;In penguins as in many other birds there are two
distinct crops of feather papillae, viz.: a crop of relatively
large papillae which develop into prepennae, the forerunners
of true feathers (pennae), and a crop of small papillae
which develop into preplumulae, the forerunners of
true down feathers (plumulae).</p>

<p>&quot;In considering the origin of feathers we are not concerned
with the true feathers (pennae), but with the nestling
feathers (prepennae), and more especially with the
papillae from which the prepennae are developed. What
we want to know is, Do the papillae which in birds develop
into the first generation of feathers correspond to the
papillae which in lizards develop into scales?</p>

<p>&quot;The late Professor Assheton, who undertook the examination
of some of the material brought home by the
Terra Nova, made a special study of the feather papillae of
the Emperor Penguin embryos from Cape Crozier. Drawings
were made to indicate the number, size and time of
appearance of the feather papillae, but unfortunately in
the notes left by the distinguished embryologist there is
no indication whether the feather papillae were regarded
as modified scale papillae or new creations resulting from
the appearance of special feather-forming factors in the
germ-plasm.</p>

<p>&quot;When eventually the three Emperor Penguin embryos
reached me that their feather rudiments might be
compared with the feather rudiments of other birds, I
noticed that in Emperor embryos the feather papillae appeared
before the scale papillae. Evidence of this was especially
afforded by the largest embryo, which had reached
about the same stage in its development as a 16-days goose
embryo.</p>

<p>&quot;In the largest Emperor embryo feather papillae occur
all over the hind-quarters and on the legs to within a short
distance of the tarsal joint. Beyond the tarsal joint even in
the largest embryo no attempt had been made to produce
the papillae which in older penguin embryos represent,
and ultimately develop into, the scaly covering of the foot.
The absence of papillae on the foot implied either that the
scale papillae were fundamentally different from feather
papillae or that for some reason or other the development
of the papillae destined to give rise to the foot scales had
been retarded. There is no evidence as far as I can ascertain
that in modern lizards the scale papillae above the tarsal
joint appear before the scale papillae beyond this joint.</p>

<p>&quot;The absence of papillae below the tarsal joint in Emperor
embryos, together with the fact that in many birds
each large feather papilla is accompanied by two or more
very small feather papillae, led me to study the papillae of
the limbs of other birds. The most striking results were
obtained from the embryos of Chinese geese in which the
legs are relatively longer than in penguins. In a 13-days
goose embryo the whole of the skin below and for some
distance above the tarsal joint is quite smooth, whereas the
skin of the rest of the leg is studded with feather papillae.
On the other hand, in an 18-days goose embryo in which
the feather papillae of the legs have developed into filaments,
each containing a fairly well-formed feather, scale
papillae occur not only on the foot below and for some distance
above the tarsal joint but also between the roots of
the feather filaments between the tarsal and the knee joints.
More important still, in a 20-days goose embryo a number
of the papillae situated between the feather filaments of the
leg were actually developing into scales each of which overlapped
the root (calamus) of a feather just as scales overlap
the foot feathers in grouse and other feather-footed birds.</p>

<p>&quot;As in bird embryos there is no evidence that feather
papillae ever develop into scales or that scale papillae ever
develop into feathers it may be assumed that feather papillae
are fundamentally different from scale papillae, the difference
presumably being due to the presence of special
factors in the germ-plasm. Just as in armadillos hairs are
found emerging from under the scales, in ancient birds as
in the feet of some modern birds the coat probably consisted
of both feathers and scales. But in course of time,
owing perhaps to the growth of the scales being arrested,
the coat of the birds, instead of consisting throughout of
well-developed scales and small inconspicuous feathers,
was almost entirely made up of a countless number of
downy feathers, well-developed scales only persisting below
the tarsal joint.</p>

<p>&quot;If the conclusions arrived at with the help of the
Emperor Penguin embryos about the origin of feathers
are justified, the worst journey in the world in the interest
of science was not made in vain.&quot;</p>
