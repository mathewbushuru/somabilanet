<p id="id00014">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]

<h4 id="id00050" style="margin-top: 2em">ACT I. Scene I.
[King Lear's Palace.]</h4>

<p id="id00051">Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund. [Kent and Glouceste converse.<br/>

Edmund stands back.]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00052">  Kent. I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany<br/>

than<br/>

     Cornwall.<br/>

  Glou. It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of<br/>

the<br/>

     kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most,<br/>

for<br/>

     equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make<br/>

     choice of either's moiety.<br/>

  Kent. Is not this your son, my lord?<br/>

  Glou. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so<br/>

often<br/>

     blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.<br/>

  Kent. I cannot conceive you.<br/>

  Glou. Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew<br/>

     round-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere<br/>

she<br/>

     had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?<br/>

  Kent. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so<br/>

     proper.<br/>

  Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder<br/>

than<br/>

     this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave<br/>

came<br/>

     something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet<br/>

was<br/>

     his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the<br/>

     whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble<br/>

gentleman,<br/>

     Edmund?<br/>

  Edm. [comes forward] No, my lord.<br/>

  Glou. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable<br/>

     friend.<br/>

  Edm. My services to your lordship.<br/>

  Kent. I must love you, and sue to know you better.<br/>

  Edm. Sir, I shall study deserving.<br/>

  Glou. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.<br/>

                                                 Sound a sennet.<br/>

     The King is coming.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00053">      Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of<br/>

      Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with<br/>

                              Followers.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00054">  Lear. Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.<br/>

  Glou. I shall, my liege.<br/>

                                 Exeunt [Gloucester and Edmund].<br/>

  Lear. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.<br/>

     Give me the map there. Know we have divided<br/>

     In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent<br/>

     To shake all cares and business from our age,<br/>

     Conferring them on younger strengths while we<br/>

     Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,<br/>

     And you, our no less loving son of Albany,<br/>

     We have this hour a constant will to publish<br/>

     Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife<br/>

     May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,<br/>

     Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,<br/>

     Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,<br/>

     And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters<br/>

     (Since now we will divest us both of rule,<br/>

     Interest of territory, cares of state),<br/>

     Which of you shall we say doth love us most?<br/>

     That we our largest bounty may extend<br/>

     Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,<br/>

     Our eldest-born, speak first.<br/>

  Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;<br/>

     Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;<br/>

     Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;<br/>

     No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;<br/>

     As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;<br/>

     A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.<br/>

     Beyond all manner of so much I love you.<br/>

  Cor. [aside] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.<br/>

  Lear. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,<br/>

     With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,<br/>

     With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,<br/>

     We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue<br/>

     Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,<br/>

     Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.<br/>

  Reg. Sir, I am made<br/>

     Of the selfsame metal that my sister is,<br/>

     And prize me at her worth. In my true heart<br/>

     I find she names my very deed of love;<br/>

     Only she comes too short, that I profess<br/>

     Myself an enemy to all other joys<br/>

     Which the most precious square of sense possesses,<br/>

     And find I am alone felicitate<br/>

     In your dear Highness' love.<br/>

  Cor. [aside] Then poor Cordelia!<br/>

     And yet not so; since I am sure my love's<br/>

     More richer than my tongue.<br/>

  Lear. To thee and thine hereditary ever<br/>

     Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,<br/>

     No less in space, validity, and pleasure<br/>

     Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,<br/>

     Although the last, not least; to whose young love<br/>

     The vines of France and milk of Burgundy<br/>

     Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw<br/>

     A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.<br/>

  Cor. Nothing, my lord.<br/>

  Lear. Nothing?<br/>

  Cor. Nothing.<br/>

  Lear. Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.<br/>

  Cor. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave<br/>

     My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty<br/>

     According to my bond; no more nor less.<br/>

  Lear. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,<br/>

     Lest it may mar your fortunes.<br/>

  Cor. Good my lord,<br/>

     You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I<br/>

     Return those duties back as are right fit,<br/>

     Obey you, love you, and most honour you.<br/>

     Why have my sisters husbands, if they say<br/>

     They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,<br/>

     That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry<br/>

     Half my love with him, half my care and duty.<br/>

     Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,<br/>

     To love my father all.<br/>

  Lear. But goes thy heart with this?<br/>

  Cor. Ay, good my lord.<br/>

  Lear. So young, and so untender?<br/>

  Cor. So young, my lord, and true.<br/>

  Lear. Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!<br/>

     For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,<br/>

     The mysteries of Hecate and the night;<br/>

     By all the operation of the orbs<br/>

     From whom we do exist and cease to be;<br/>

     Here I disclaim all my paternal care,<br/>

     Propinquity and property of blood,<br/>

     And as a stranger to my heart and me<br/>

     Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,<br/>

     Or he that makes his generation messes<br/>

     To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom<br/>

     Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,<br/>

     As thou my sometime daughter.<br/>

  Kent. Good my liege-<br/>

  Lear. Peace, Kent!<br/>

     Come not between the dragon and his wrath.<br/>

     I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest<br/>

     On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-<br/>

     So be my grave my peace as here I give<br/>

     Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?<br/>

     Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,<br/>

     With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;<br/>

     Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.<br/>

     I do invest you jointly in my power,<br/>

     Preeminence, and all the large effects<br/>

     That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,<br/>

     With reservation of an hundred knights,<br/>

     By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode<br/>

     Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain<br/>

     The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,<br/>

     Revenue, execution of the rest,<br/>

     Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,<br/>

     This coronet part betwixt you.<br/>

  Kent. Royal Lear,<br/>

     Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,<br/>

     Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,<br/>

     As my great patron thought on in my prayers-<br/>

  Lear. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.<br/>

  Kent. Let it fall rather, though the fork invade<br/>

     The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly<br/>

     When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?<br/>

     Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak<br/>

     When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound<br/>

     When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;<br/>

     And in thy best consideration check<br/>

     This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,<br/>

     Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,<br/>

     Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound<br/>

     Reverbs no hollowness.<br/>

  Lear. Kent, on thy life, no more!<br/>

  Kent. My life I never held but as a pawn<br/>

     To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,<br/>

     Thy safety being the motive.<br/>

  Lear. Out of my sight!<br/>

  Kent. See better, Lear, and let me still remain<br/>

     The true blank of thine eye.<br/>

  Lear. Now by Apollo-<br/>

  Kent. Now by Apollo, King,<br/>

     Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.<br/>

  Lear. O vassal! miscreant!<br/>

                                   [Lays his hand on his sword.]<br/>

  Alb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear!<br/>

  Kent. Do!<br/>

     Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow<br/>

     Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,<br/>

     Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,<br/>

     I'll tell thee thou dost evil.<br/>

  Lear. Hear me, recreant!<br/>

     On thine allegiance, hear me!<br/>

     Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-<br/>

     Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride<br/>

     To come between our sentence and our power,-<br/>

     Five days we do allot thee for provision<br/>

maid,<br/>

     [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your<br/>

deeds<br/>

        approve,<br/>

     That good effects may spring from words of love.<br/>

     Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;<br/>

     He'll shape his old course in a country new.<br/>

Exit.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00055">  Flourish. Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy;<br/>

Attendants.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00056">  Glou. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.<br/>

  Lear. My Lord of Burgundy,<br/>

     We first address toward you, who with this king<br/>

     Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least<br/>

     Will you require in present dower with her,<br/>

     Or cease your quest of love?<br/>

  Bur. Most royal Majesty,<br/>

     I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,<br/>

     Nor will you tender less.<br/>

  Lear. Right noble Burgundy,<br/>

     When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;<br/>

     But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.<br/>

     If aught within that little seeming substance,<br/>

     Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,<br/>

     And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,<br/>

     She's there, and she is yours.<br/>

  Bur. I know no answer.<br/>

  Lear. Will you, with those infirmities she owes,<br/>

     Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,<br/>

     Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,<br/>

     Take her, or leave her?<br/>

  Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.<br/>

     Election makes not up on such conditions.<br/>

  Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,<br/>

     I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,<br/>

     I would not from your love make such a stray<br/>

     To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you<br/>

     T' avert your liking a more worthier way<br/>

     Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd<br/>

     Almost t' acknowledge hers.<br/>

  France. This is most strange,<br/>

     That she that even but now was your best object,<br/>

     The argument of your praise, balm of your age,<br/>

     Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time<br/>

     Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle<br/>

     So many folds of favour. Sure her offence<br/>

     Must be of such unnatural degree<br/>

     That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection<br/>

     Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her<br/>

     Must be a faith that reason without miracle<br/>

     Should never plant in me.<br/>

  Cor. I yet beseech your Majesty,<br/>

     If for I want that glib and oily art<br/>

     To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,<br/>

     I'll do't before I speak- that you make known<br/>

     It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,<br/>

     No unchaste action or dishonoured step,<br/>

     That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;<br/>

     But even for want of that for which I am richer-<br/>

     A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue<br/>

     As I am glad I have not, though not to have it<br/>

     Hath lost me in your liking.<br/>

  Lear. Better thou<br/>

     Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better.<br/>

  France. Is it but this- a tardiness in nature<br/>

     Which often leaves the history unspoke<br/>

     That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,<br/>

     What say you to the lady? Love's not love<br/>

     When it is mingled with regards that stands<br/>

     Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?<br/>

     She is herself a dowry.<br/>

  Bur. Royal Lear,<br/>

     Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,<br/>

     And here I take Cordelia by the hand,<br/>

     Duchess of Burgundy.<br/>

  Lear. Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.<br/>

  Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a father<br/>

     That you must lose a husband.<br/>

  Cor. Peace be with Burgundy!<br/>

     Since that respects of fortune are his love,<br/>

     I shall not be his wife.<br/>

  France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;<br/>

     Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!<br/>

     Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.<br/>

     Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.<br/>

     Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect<br/>

     My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.<br/>

     Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,<br/>

     Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.<br/>

     Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy<br/>

     Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.<br/>

     Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.<br/>

     Thou losest here, a better where to find.<br/>

  Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we<br/>

     Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see<br/>

     That face of hers again. Therefore be gone<br/>

     Without our grace, our love, our benison.<br/>

     Come, noble Burgundy.<br/>

             Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwall, Albany,<br/>

                                    Gloucester, and Attendants].<br/>

  France. Bid farewell to your sisters.<br/>

  Cor. The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes<br/>

     Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are;<br/>

     And, like a sister, am most loath to call<br/>

     Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father.<br/>

     To your professed bosoms I commit him;<br/>

     But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,<br/>

     I would prefer him to a better place!<br/>

     So farewell to you both.<br/>

  Gon. Prescribe not us our duties.<br/>

  Reg. Let your study<br/>

     Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you<br/>

     At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,<br/>

     And well are worth the want that you have wanted.<br/>

  Cor. Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.<br/>

     Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.<br/>

     Well may you prosper!<br/>

  France. Come, my fair Cordelia.<br/>

                                     Exeunt France and Cordelia.<br/>

  Gon. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly<br/>

     appertains to us both. I think our father will hence<br/>

to-night.<br/>

  Reg. That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.<br/>

  Gon. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we<br/>

     have made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd our<br/>

     sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast<br/>

her<br/>

     off appears too grossly.<br/>

  Reg. 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but<br/>

slenderly<br/>

     known himself.<br/>

  Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then<br/>

     must we look to receive from his age, not alone the<br/>

     imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal<br/>

     the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring<br/>

with<br/>

     them.<br/>

  Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as<br/>

this<br/>

     of Kent's banishment.<br/>

  Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France<br/>

and<br/>

     him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry<br/>

authority<br/>

     with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of<br/>

his<br/>

     will but offend us.<br/>

  Reg. We shall further think on't.<br/>

  Gon. We must do something, and i' th' heat.<br/>

                                                         Exeunt.<br/>

  Edm. So please your lordship, none.<br/>

                                           [Puts up the letter.]<br/>

  Glou. Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?<br/>

  Edm. I know no news, my lord.<br/>

  Glou. What paper were you reading?<br/>

  Edm. Nothing, my lord.<br/>

  Glou. No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into<br/>

</p>

<p id="id00063" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     Hum! Conspiracy? 'Sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy
half
     his revenue.' My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a
heart
     and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought
it?
  Edm. It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it.
I
     found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.
  Glou. You know the character to be your brother's?
  Edm. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were
his;
     but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
  Glou. It is his.
  Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in
the
     contents.
  Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this business?
  Edm. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be
fit
     that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father
     should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his
revenue.
  Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter!
Abhorred
     villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than
     brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him.
Abominable
     villain! Where is he?
  Edm. I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to
suspend
     your indignation against my brother till you can derive from
him
     better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain
course;
     where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
     purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and
shake
     in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my
life
     for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
     honour, and to no other pretence of danger.
  Glou. Think you so?
  Edm. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you
shall
     hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have
your
     satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this
very
     evening.
  Glou. He cannot be such a monster.
  Edm. Nor is not, sure.
  Glou. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.
     Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I
pray
     you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would
unstate
     myself to be in a due resolution.
  Edm. I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I
     shall find means, and acquaint you withal.
  Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good
to
     us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus,
yet
     nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. Love
cools,
     friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies;
in
     countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond
crack'd
     'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
     prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from
bias
     of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the
best
     of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
     ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find
out
     this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
     carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his
     offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.                       Exit.
  Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we
are
     sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we
make
     guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as
if
     we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
     knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;
     drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of
     planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a
divine
     thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to
lay
     his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father
     compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my
     nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough
and
     lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the
     maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my
bastardizing.

  Edg. How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are<br/>

you<br/>

  Edm. I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other<br/>

day,<br/>

     what should follow these eclipses.<br/>

  Edg. Do you busy yourself with that?<br/>

  Edm. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily:<br/>

as<br/>

     of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,<br/>

     dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,<br/>

     menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless<br/>

     diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,<br/>

     nuptial breaches, and I know not what.<br/>

  Edg. How long have you been a sectary astronomical?<br/>

  Edm. Come, come! When saw you my father last?<br/>

  Edg. The night gone by.<br/>

  Edm. Spake you with him?<br/>

  Edg. Ay, two hours together.<br/>

  Edm. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him<br/>

by<br/>

     word or countenance<br/>

  Edg. None at all.<br/>

  Edm. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at<br/>

my<br/>

     entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath<br/>

     qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant<br/>

so<br/>

     rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would<br/>

     scarcely allay.<br/>

  Edg. Some villain hath done me wrong.<br/>

  Edm. That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance<br/>

     the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire<br/>

with me<br/>

     to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my<br/>

abroad,<br/>

     go arm'd.<br/>

  Edg. Arm'd, brother?<br/>

  Edm. Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no<br/>

honest man<br/>

     if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you<br/>

what I<br/>

     have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and<br/>

     horror of it. Pray you, away!<br/>

  Edg. Shall I hear from you anon?<br/>

  Edm. I do serve you in this business.<br/>

                                                     Exit Edgar.<br/>

     A credulous father! and a brother noble,<br/>

     Whose nature is so far from doing harms<br/>

<p id="id00077">                            [Enter Knight]</p>

<p id="id00078">     How now? Where's that mongrel?<br/>

  Knight. He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.<br/>

  Lear. Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him?<br/>

  Knight. Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would<br/>

not.<br/>

  Lear. He would not?<br/>

  Knight. My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my<br/>

judgment<br/>

     your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious<br/>

affection<br/>

     as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness<br/>

appears<br/>

     as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself<br/>

also<br/>

     and your daughter.<br/>

  Lear. Ha! say'st thou so?<br/>

  Knight. I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for<br/>

     my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd.<br/>

  Lear. Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have<br/>

     perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather<br/>

     blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence<br/>

     and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. But<br/>

     where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days.<br/>

  Knight. Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool<br/>

     hath much pined away.<br/>

  Lear. No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my<br/>

     daughter I would speak with her. [Exit Knight.] Go you, call<br/>

     hither my fool.<br/>

                                            [Exit an Attendant.]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00079">                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.</p>

<p id="id00080">     O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?<br/>

  Osw. My lady's father.<br/>

  Lear. 'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog!<br/>

you<br/>

     slave! you cur!<br/>

  Osw. I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.<br/>

  Lear. Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?<br/>

                                                  [Strikes him.]<br/>

  Osw. I'll not be strucken, my lord.<br/>

  Kent. Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?<br/>

                                            [Trips up his heels.<br/>

  Lear. I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love<br/>

thee.<br/>

  Kent. Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences. Away,<br/>

     away! If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry;<br/>

but<br/>

     away! Go to! Have you wisdom? So.<br/>

                                               [Pushes him out.]<br/>

  Lear. Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of<br/>

thy<br/>

     service.                                     [Gives money.]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00081">                             Enter Fool.</p>

<p id="id00082">  Fool. Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb.<br/>

                                          [Offers Kent his cap.]<br/>

  Lear. How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?<br/>

  Fool. Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.<br/>

  Kent. Why, fool?<br/>

  Fool. Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an<br/>

thou<br/>

     canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold<br/>

shortly.<br/>

     There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two<br/>

on's<br/>

     daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If<br/>

     thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now,<br/>

     nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!<br/>

  Lear. Why, my boy?<br/>

  Fool. If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs<br/>

myself.<br/>

     There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.<br/>

  Lear. Take heed, sirrah- the whip.<br/>

  Fool. Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out,<br/>

when<br/>

     Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink.<br/>

  Lear. A pestilent gall to me!<br/>

  Fool. Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.<br/>

  Lear. Do.<br/>

  Fool. Mark it, nuncle.<br/>

          Have more than thou showest,<br/>

          Speak less than thou knowest,<br/>

          Lend less than thou owest,<br/>

          Ride more than thou goest,<br/>

          Learn more than thou trowest,<br/>

          Set less than thou throwest;<br/>

          Leave thy drink and thy whore,<br/>

          And keep in-a-door,<br/>

          And thou shalt have more<br/>

          Than two tens to a score.<br/>

  Kent. This is nothing, fool.<br/>

  Fool. Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave<br/>

me<br/>

     nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?<br/>

  Lear. Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.<br/>

  Fool. [to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land<br/>

     comes to. He will not believe a fool.<br/>

  Lear. A bitter fool!<br/>

  Fool. Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter<br/>

     fool and a sweet fool?<br/>

  Lear. No, lad; teach me.<br/>

  Fool.   That lord that counsell'd thee<br/>

            To give away thy land,<br/>

          Come place him here by me-<br/>

            Do thou for him stand.<br/>

          The sweet and bitter fool<br/>

            Will presently appear;<br/>

          The one in motley here,<br/>

            The other found out there.<br/>

  Lear. Dost thou call me fool, boy?<br/>

  Fool. All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast<br/>

     born with.<br/>

  Kent. This is not altogether fool, my lord.<br/>

  Fool. No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had<br/>

a<br/>

     monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too,<br/>

they<br/>

     will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be<br/>

     snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two<br/>

     crowns.<br/>

  Lear. What two crowns shall they be?<br/>

  Fool. Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up<br/>

the<br/>

     meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown<br/>

i'<br/>

     th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass<br/>

on<br/>

     thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald<br/>

crown<br/>

     when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself<br/>

in<br/>

     this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00083">     [Sings]    Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,<br/>

                  For wise men are grown foppish;<br/>

                They know not how their wits to wear,<br/>

                  Their manners are so apish.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00084">  Lear. When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?<br/>

  Fool. I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy<br/>

daughters<br/>

     thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st<br/>

down<br/>

     thine own breeches,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00085">     [Sings]    Then they for sudden joy did weep,<br/>

                  And I for sorrow sung,<br/>

                That such a king should play bo-peep<br/>

                  And go the fools among.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00086">     Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool<br/>

to<br/>

     lie. I would fain learn to lie.<br/>

  Lear. An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.<br/>

  Fool. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll<br/>

have me<br/>

     whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for<br/>

lying;<br/>

     and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had<br/>

rather be<br/>

     any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,<br/>

     nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left<br/>

nothing<br/>

     i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00087">                            Enter Goneril.</p>

<p id="id00088">  Lear. How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks<br/>

you<br/>

     are too much o' late i' th' frown.<br/>

  Fool. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care<br/>

for<br/>

     her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am<br/>

better<br/>

     than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.<br/>

     [To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your<br/>

<p id="id00090">     [Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod.<br/>

  Gon. Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,<br/>

     But other of your insolent retinue<br/>

     Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth<br/>

     In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,<br/>

     I had thought, by making this well known unto you,<br/>

     To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,<br/>

     By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,<br/>

     That you protect this course, and put it on<br/>

     By your allowance; which if you should, the fault<br/>

     Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,<br/>

     Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,<br/>

     Might in their working do you that offence<br/>

     Which else were shame, that then necessity<br/>

     Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away<br/>

     These dispositions that of late transform you<br/>

     From what you rightly are.<br/>

  Fool. May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?<br/>

     Whoop, Jug, I love thee!<br/>

  Lear. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.<br/>

     Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?<br/>

     Either his notion weakens, his discernings<br/>

     Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!<br/>

     Who is it that can tell me who I am?<br/>

  Fool. Lear's shadow.<br/>

  Lear. I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,<br/>

     Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded<br/>

     I had daughters.<br/>

  Fool. Which they will make an obedient father.<br/>

  Lear. Your name, fair gentlewoman?<br/>

  Gon. This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour<br/>

     Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you<br/>

     To understand my purposes aright.<br/>

     As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.<br/>

     Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;<br/>

     Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold<br/>

     That this our court, infected with their manners,<br/>

     Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust<br/>

     Make it more like a tavern or a brothel<br/>

     Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak<br/>

     For instant remedy. Be then desir'd<br/>

     By her that else will take the thing she begs<br/>

     A little to disquantity your train,<br/>

     And the remainder that shall still depend<br/>

     To be such men as may besort your age,<br/>

     Which know themselves, and you.<br/>

  Lear. Darkness and devils!<br/>

     Saddle my horses! Call my train together!<br/>

     Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;<br/>

     Yet have I left a daughter.<br/>

     Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature<br/>

     From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love<br/>

     To make this creature fruitful.<br/>

     Into her womb convey sterility;<br/>

     Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,<br/>

     With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,<br/>

     Turn all her mother's pains and benefits<br/>

     To laughter and contempt, that she may feel<br/>

     How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is<br/>

  Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean<br/>

the<br/>

Dukes<br/>

     Advise yourself.<br/>

  Edg. I am sure on't, not a word.<br/>

  Edm. I hear my father coming. Pardon me!<br/>

     In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.<br/>

     Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.-<br/>

     Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!<br/>

     Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.<br/>

                                                     Exit Edgar.<br/>

     Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion<br/>

     Of my more fierce endeavour. [Stabs his arm.] I have seen<br/>

        drunkards<br/>

     Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!-<br/>

     Stop, stop! No help?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00111">             Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.</p>

<p id="id00112">  Glou. Now, Edmund, where's the villain?<br/>

  Edm. Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,<br/>

     Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon<br/>

     To stand 's auspicious mistress.<br/>

  Glou. But where is he?<br/>

  Edm. Look, sir, I bleed.<br/>

  Glou. Where is the villain, Edmund?<br/>

  Edm. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-<br/>

  Glou. Pursue him, ho! Go after.        [Exeunt some Servants].<br/>

     By no means what?<br/>

  Edm. Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;<br/>

     But that I told him the revenging gods<br/>

     'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;<br/>

     Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond<br/>

     The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine,<br/>

     Seeing how loathly opposite I stood<br/>

     To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion<br/>

     With his prepared sword he charges home<br/>

     My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;<br/>

     But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,<br/>

     Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter,<br/>

     Or whether gasted by the noise I made,<br/>

     Full suddenly he fled.<br/>

  Glou. Let him fly far.<br/>

     Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;<br/>

     And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master,<br/>

     My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.<br/>

     By his authority I will proclaim it<br/>

     That he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,<br/>

     Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;<br/>

     He that conceals him, death.<br/>

  Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intent<br/>

     And found him pight to do it, with curst speech<br/>

     I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,<br/>

     'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,<br/>

     If I would stand against thee, would the reposal<br/>

     Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee<br/>

     Make thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny<br/>

     (As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce<br/>

     My very character), I'ld turn it all<br/>

     To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;<br/>

     And thou must make a dullard of the world,<br/>

     If they not thought the profits of my death<br/>

     Were very pregnant and potential spurs<br/>

     To make thee seek it.'<br/>

  Glou. Strong and fast'ned villain!<br/>

     Would he deny his letter? I never got him.<br/>

                                                  Tucket within.<br/>

     Hark, the Duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.<br/>

     All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;<br/>

     The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture<br/>

     I will send far and near, that all the kingdom<br/>

     May have due note of him, and of my land,<br/>

     Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means<br/>

     To make thee capable.<br/>

<p id="id00113">                Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.</p>

<p id="id00114">  Corn. How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither<br/>

     (Which I can call but now) I have heard strange news.<br/>

  Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short<br/>

     Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?<br/>

  Glou. O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!<br/>

  Reg. What, did my father's godson seek your life?<br/>

     He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?<br/>

  Glou. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!<br/>

  Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights<br/>

     That tend upon my father?<br/>

  Glou. I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!<br/>

  Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort.<br/>

  Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.<br/>

     'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,<br/>

     To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.<br/>

     I have this present evening from my sister<br/>

     Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions<br/>

     That, if they come to sojourn at my house,<br/>

     I'll not be there.<br/>

  Corn. Nor I, assure thee, Regan.<br/>

     Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father<br/>

     A childlike office.<br/>

  Edm. 'Twas my duty, sir.<br/>

  Glou. He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd<br/>

     This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.<br/>

  Corn. Is he pursued?<br/>

  Glou. Ay, my good lord.<br/>

  Corn. If he be taken, he shall never more<br/>

     Be fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose,<br/>

     How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,<br/>

     Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant<br/>

     So much commend itself, you shall be ours.<br/>

     Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;<br/>

     You we first seize on.<br/>

  Edm. I shall serve you, sir,<br/>

     Truly, however else.<br/>

  Glou. For him I thank your Grace.<br/>

  Corn. You know not why we came to visit you-<br/>

  Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.<br/>

     Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,<br/>

     Wherein we must have use of your advice.<br/>

     Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,<br/>

     Of differences, which I best thought it fit<br/>

     To answer from our home. The several messengers<br/>

     From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,<br/>

     Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow<br/>

     Your needful counsel to our business,<br/>

     Which craves the instant use.<br/>

  Glou. I serve you, madam.<br/>

     Your Graces are right welcome.<br/>

  Osw. Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.<br/>

  Kent. Fellow, I know thee.<br/>

  Osw. What dost thou know me for?<br/>

  Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base,<br/>

proud,<br/>

     shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,<br/>

     worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking,<br/>

     one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in<br/>

knave,<br/>

me!<br/>

     Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy<br/>

heels<br/>

     before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for,<br/>

  Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King<br/>

  Corn. What is your difference? Speak.<br/>

  Osw. I am scarce in breath, my lord.<br/>

  Kent. No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You<br/>

cowardly<br/>

     rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.<br/>

  Corn. Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?<br/>

  Kent. Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not<br/>

have<br/>

     made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the<br/>

trade.<br/>

  Corn. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?<br/>

  Osw. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd<br/>

     At suit of his grey beard-<br/>

  Kent. Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if<br/>

     you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain<br/>

into<br/>

     mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my<br/>

grey<br/>

     beard,' you wagtail?<br/>

  Corn. Peace, sirrah!<br/>

     You beastly knave, know you no reverence?<br/>

  Kent. Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.<br/>

  Corn. Why art thou angry?<br/>

  Kent. That such a slave as this should wear a sword,<br/>

     Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,<br/>

     Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain<br/>

     Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion<br/>

     That in the natures of their lords rebel,<br/>

     Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;<br/>

     Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks<br/>

     With every gale and vary of their masters,<br/>

     Knowing naught (like dogs) but following.<br/>

     A plague upon your epileptic visage!<br/>

     Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?<br/>

     Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,<br/>

     I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.<br/>

  Corn. What, art thou mad, old fellow?<br/>

  Glou. How fell you out? Say that.<br/>

  Kent. No contraries hold more antipathy<br/>

     Than I and such a knave.<br/>

  Corn. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?<br/>

  Kent. His countenance likes me not.<br/>

  Corn. No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.<br/>

  Kent. Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.<br/>

     I have seen better faces in my time<br/>

     Than stands on any shoulder that I see<br/>

     Before me at this instant.<br/>

  Corn. This is some fellow<br/>

     Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect<br/>

     A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb<br/>

     Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he!<br/>

     An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth!<br/>

     An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.<br/>

     These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness<br/>

     Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends<br/>

     Than twenty silly-ducking observants<br/>

     That stretch their duties nicely.<br/>

  Kent. Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,<br/>

     Under th' allowance of your great aspect,<br/>

     Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire<br/>

     On flickering Phoebus' front-<br/>

  Corn. What mean'st by this?<br/>

  Kent. To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I<br/>

     know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a<br/>

plain<br/>

     accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,<br/>

     though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.<br/>

  Corn. What was th' offence you gave him?<br/>

  Osw. I never gave him any.<br/>

     It pleas'd the King his master very late<br/>

     To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;<br/>

     When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,<br/>

     Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd<br/>

     And put upon him such a deal of man<br/>

     That worthied him, got praises of the King<br/>

     For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;<br/>

     And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,<br/>

     Drew on me here again.<br/>

  Kent. None of these rogues and cowards<br/>

     But Ajax is their fool.<br/>

  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks!<br/>

     You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,<br/>

     We'll teach you-<br/>

  Kent. Sir, I am too old to learn.<br/>

     Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;<br/>

     On whose employment I was sent to you.<br/>

     You shall do small respect, show too bold malice<br/>

     Against the grace and person of my master,<br/>

     Stocking his messenger.<br/>

  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,<br/>

     There shall he sit till noon.<br/>

  Reg. Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!<br/>

  Kent. Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,<br/>

     You should not use me so.<br/>

  Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will.<br/>

  Corn. This is a fellow of the selfsame colour<br/>

     Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!<br/>

                                             Stocks brought out.<br/>

  Glou. Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.<br/>

     His fault is much, and the good King his master<br/>

     Will check him for't. Your purpos'd low correction<br/>

     Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches<br/>

     For pilf'rings and most common trespasses<br/>

     Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill<br/>

     That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,<br/>

     Should have him thus restrain'd.<br/>

  Corn. I'll answer that.<br/>

  Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse,<br/>

     To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,<br/>

     For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-<br/>

                                    [Kent is put in the stocks.]<br/>

     Come, my good lord, away.<br/>

                           Exeunt [all but Gloucester and Kent].<br/>

  Glou. I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure,<br/>

     Whose disposition, all the world well knows,<br/>

     Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. I'll entreat for thee.<br/>

  Kent. Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.<br/>

     Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.<br/>

     A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.<br/>

     Give you good morrow!<br/>

  Glou. The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.<br/>

Exit.<br/>

  Kent. Good King, that must approve the common saw,<br/>

     Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st<br/>

     To the warm sun!<br/>

     Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,<br/>

     That by thy comfortable beams I may<br/>

     Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles<br/>

     But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,<br/>

     Who hath most fortunately been inform'd<br/>

     Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time<br/>

     From this enormous state, seeking to give<br/>

     Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,<br/>

     Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold<br/>

     This shameful lodging.<br/>

     Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.<br/>

  Lear. Ha!<br/>

     Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?<br/>

  Kent. No, my lord.<br/>

the<br/>

     head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and<br/>

men<br/>

     by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears<br/>

     Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,<br/>

  Kent. My lord, when at their home<br/>

     I did commend your Highness' letters to them,<br/>

     Ere I was risen from the place that show'd<br/>

     My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,<br/>

     Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth<br/>

     From Goneril his mistress salutations;<br/>

     Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,<br/>

     Which presently they read; on whose contents,<br/>

     They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,<br/>

     Commanded me to follow and attend<br/>

     The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks,<br/>

     And meeting here the other messenger,<br/>

     Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine-<br/>

     Being the very fellow which of late<br/>

     Display'd so saucily against your Highness-<br/>

     Having more man than wit about me, drew.<br/>

     He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.<br/>

     Your son and daughter found this trespass worth<br/>

     thou'dst well deserv'd it.<br/>

  Kent. Why, fool?<br/>

  Fool. We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's<br/>

no<br/>

by<br/>

     their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among<br/>

twenty<br/>

     but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a<br/>

great<br/>

     wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with<br/>

following<br/>

     it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee<br/>

after.<br/>

     When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine<br/>

     I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.<br/>

  Glou. Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.<br/>

  Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?<br/>

  Glou. Ay, my good lord.<br/>

  Lear. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father<br/>

     Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.<br/>

     Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!<br/>

     Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-<br/>

     No, but not yet! May be he is not well.<br/>

     Infirmity doth still neglect all office<br/>

     Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves<br/>

     When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind<br/>

     To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;<br/>

     And am fallen out with my more headier will,<br/>

     To take the indispos'd and sickly fit<br/>

     For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore<br/>

     Should be sit here? This act persuades me<br/>

     That this remotion of the Duke and her<br/>

     Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.<br/>

     Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-<br/>

     Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,<br/>

     Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum<br/>

     Till it cry sleep to death.<br/>

  Glou. I would have all well betwixt you.                 Exit.<br/>

  Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!<br/>

  Fool. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when<br/>

she<br/>

     put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs<br/>

with<br/>

     a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother<br/>

that,<br/>

     in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00130">             Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.</p>

<p id="id00131">  Lear. Good morrow to you both.<br/>

  Corn. Hail to your Grace!<br/>

                                       Kent here set at liberty.<br/>

  Reg. I am glad to see your Highness.<br/>

  Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason<br/>

     I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,<br/>

     I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,<br/>

     Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?<br/>

     Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,<br/>

     Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied<br/>

     Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!<br/>

                                   [Lays his hand on his heart.]<br/>

     I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe<br/>

     With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!<br/>

  Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope<br/>

     You less know how to value her desert<br/>

     Than she to scant her duty.<br/>

  Lear. Say, how is that?<br/>

  Reg. I cannot think my sister in the least<br/>

     Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance<br/>

     She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,<br/>

     'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,<br/>

     As clears her from all blame.<br/>

  Lear. My curses on her!<br/>

  Reg. O, sir, you are old!<br/>

     Nature in you stands on the very verge<br/>

     Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led<br/>

     By some discretion that discerns your state<br/>

     Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you<br/>

     That to our sister you do make return;<br/>

     Say you have wrong'd her, sir.<br/>

  Lear. Ask her forgiveness?<br/>

     Do you but mark how this becomes the house:<br/>

     'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.          [Kneels.]<br/>

     Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg<br/>

     That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'<br/>

  Reg. Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.<br/>

     Return you to my sister.<br/>

  Lear. [rises] Never, Regan!<br/>

     She hath abated me of half my train;<br/>

     Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,<br/>

     Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.<br/>

     All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall<br/>

     On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,<br/>

     You taking airs, with lameness!<br/>

  Corn. Fie, sir, fie!<br/>

  Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames<br/>

     Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,<br/>

     You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,<br/>

     To fall and blast her pride!<br/>

  Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on me<br/>

     When the rash mood is on.<br/>

  Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.<br/>

     Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give<br/>

     Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine<br/>

     Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee<br/>

     To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,<br/>

     To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,<br/>

     And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt<br/>

     Against my coming in. Thou better know'st<br/>

     The offices of nature, bond of childhood,<br/>

     Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.<br/>

     Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,<br/>

     Wherein I thee endow'd.<br/>

  Reg. Good sir, to th' purpose.<br/>

                                                  Tucket within.<br/>

  Lear. Who put my man i' th' stocks?<br/>

  Corn. What trumpet's that?<br/>

  Reg. I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,<br/>

     That she would soon be here.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00132">                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.</p>

<p id="id00133">     Is your lady come?<br/>

  Lear. This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride<br/>

     Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.<br/>

     Out, varlet, from my sight!<br/>

  Corn. What means your Grace?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00134">                            Enter Goneril.</p>

<p id="id00135">  Lear. Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope<br/>

     Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!<br/>

     If you do love old men, if your sweet sway<br/>

     Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,<br/>

     Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!<br/>

     [To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-<br/>

     O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?<br/>

  Gon. Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?<br/>

     All's not offence that indiscretion finds<br/>

     And dotage terms so.<br/>

  Lear. O sides, you are too tough!<br/>

     Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?<br/>

  Corn. I set him there, sir; but his own disorders<br/>

     Deserv'd much less advancement.<br/>

  Lear. You? Did you?<br/>

  Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.<br/>

     If, till the expiration of your month,<br/>

     You will return and sojourn with my sister,<br/>

     Dismissing half your train, come then to me.<br/>

     I am now from home, and out of that provision<br/>

     Which shall be needful for your entertainment.<br/>

  Lear. Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?<br/>

     No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose<br/>

     To wage against the enmity o' th' air,<br/>

     To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-<br/>

     Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?<br/>

     Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took<br/>

     Our youngest born, I could as well be brought<br/>

     To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg<br/>

     To keep base life afoot. Return with her?<br/>

     Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter<br/>

     To this detested groom.                 [Points at Oswald.]<br/>

  Gon. At your choice, sir.<br/>

  Lear. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.<br/>

     I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.<br/>

     We'll no more meet, no more see one another.<br/>

     But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;<br/>

     Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,<br/>

     Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,<br/>

     A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle<br/>

     In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.<br/>

     Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.<br/>

     I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot<br/>

     Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.<br/>

     Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;<br/>

     I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,<br/>

     I and my hundred knights.<br/>

  Reg. Not altogether so.<br/>

     I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided<br/>

     For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;<br/>

     For those that mingle reason with your passion<br/>

     Must be content to think you old, and so-<br/>

     But she knows what she does.<br/>

  Lear. Is this well spoken?<br/>

  Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?<br/>

     Is it not well? What should you need of more?<br/>

     Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger<br/>

     Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house<br/>

     Should many people, under two commands,<br/>

     Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.<br/>

  Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance<br/>

     From those that she calls servants, or from mine?<br/>

  Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,<br/>

     We could control them. If you will come to me<br/>

     (For now I spy a danger), I entreat you<br/>

     To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more<br/>

     Will I give place or notice.<br/>

  Lear. I gave you all-<br/>

  Reg. And in good time you gave it!<br/>

  Lear. Made you my guardians, my depositaries;<br/>

     But kept a reservation to be followed<br/>

     With such a number. What, must I come to you<br/>

     With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?<br/>

  Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me.<br/>

  Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd<br/>

     When others are more wicked; not being the worst<br/>

     Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with<br/>

thee.<br/>

     Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,<br/>

     And thou art twice her love.<br/>

  Gon. Hear, me, my lord.<br/>

     What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,<br/>

     To follow in a house where twice so many<br/>

     Have a command to tend you?<br/>

  Reg. What need one?<br/>

  Lear. O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars<br/>

     Are in the poorest thing superfluous.<br/>

     Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br/>

     Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:<br/>

     If only to go warm were gorgeous,<br/>

     Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st<br/>

     Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-<br/>

     You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!<br/>

     You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,<br/>

     As full of grief as age; wretched in both.<br/>

     If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts<br/>

     Against their father, fool me not so much<br/>

     To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,<br/>

     And let not women's weapons, water drops,<br/>

     Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!<br/>

     I will have such revenges on you both<br/>

     That all the world shall- I will do such things-<br/>

     What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be<br/>

     The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.<br/>

     No, I'll not weep.<br/>

     I have full cause of weeping, but this heart<br/>

     Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws<br/>

     Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!<br/>

              Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and<br/>

                                                        tempest.<br/>

  Corn. Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.<br/>

  Reg. This house is little; the old man and 's people<br/>

     Cannot be well bestow'd.<br/>

  Gon. 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest<br/>

     And must needs taste his folly.<br/>

  Reg. For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,<br/>

     But not one follower.<br/>

  Gon. So am I purpos'd.<br/>

     Where is my Lord of Gloucester?<br/>

  Corn. Followed the old man forth.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00136">                          Enter Gloucester.</p>

<p id="id00137">     He is return'd.<br/>

  Glou. The King is in high rage.<br/>

  Corn. Whither is he going?<br/>

  Glou. He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.<br/>

  Corn. 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.<br/>

  Gon. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.<br/>

  Glou. Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds<br/>

     Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about<br/>

     There's scarce a bush.<br/>

  Reg. O, sir, to wilful men<br/>

     The injuries that they themselves procure<br/>

     Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.<br/>

     He is attended with a desperate train,<br/>

     And what they may incense him to, being apt<br/>

     To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.<br/>

  Corn. Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.<br/>

     My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.<br/>

<h3 id="id00139" style="margin-top: 3em">ACT III. Scene I.
A heath.</h3>

<p id="id00140">Storm still. Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several doors.</p>

<p id="id00141">  Kent. Who's there, besides foul weather?<br/>

  Gent. One minded like the weather, most unquietly.<br/>

  Kent. I know you. Where's the King?<br/>

  Gent. Contending with the fretful elements;<br/>

     Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,<br/>

     Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,<br/>

     That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,<br/>

     Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,<br/>

     Catch in their fury and make nothing of;<br/>

     Strives in his little world of man to outscorn<br/>

     The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.<br/>

     This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,<br/>

     The lion and the belly-pinched wolf<br/>

     Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,<br/>

     And bids what will take all.<br/>

  Kent. But who is with him?<br/>

  Gent. None but the fool, who labours to outjest<br/>

     His heart-struck injuries.<br/>

  Kent. Sir, I do know you,<br/>

     And dare upon the warrant of my note<br/>

     Commend a dear thing to you. There is division<br/>

     (Although as yet the face of it be cover'd<br/>

     With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;<br/>

     Who have (as who have not, that their great stars<br/>

     Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,<br/>

     Which are to France the spies and speculations<br/>

     Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,<br/>

     Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,<br/>

     Or the hard rein which both of them have borne<br/>

     Against the old kind King, or something deeper,<br/>

     Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings-<br/>

     But, true it is, from France there comes a power<br/>

     Into this scattered kingdom, who already,<br/>

     Wise in our negligence, have secret feet<br/>

     In some of our best ports and are at point<br/>

     To show their open banner. Now to you:<br/>

     If on my credit you dare build so far<br/>

     To make your speed to Dover, you shall find<br/>

     Some that will thank you, making just report<br/>

     Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow<br/>

     The King hath cause to plain.<br/>

     I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,<br/>

     And from some knowledge and assurance offer<br/>

     This office to you.<br/>

  Gent. I will talk further with you.<br/>

  Kent. No, do not.<br/>

     For confirmation that I am much more<br/>

     Than my out-wall, open this purse and take<br/>

     What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia<br/>

     (As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,<br/>

     And she will tell you who your fellow is<br/>

     That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!<br/>

     I will go seek the King.<br/>

  Gent. Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?<br/>

  Kent. Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:<br/>

     That, when we have found the King (in which your pain<br/>

     That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him<br/>

     Holla the other.<br/>

                                             Exeunt [severally].<br/>

<h2 id="id00142" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene II.
Another part of the heath.</h2>

<p id="id00143">Storm still. Enter Lear and Fool.</p>

<p id="id00144">  Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!<br/>

     You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout<br/>

     Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!<br/>

     You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,<br/>

     Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,<br/>

     Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,<br/>

     Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,<br/>

     Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,<br/>

     That makes ingrateful man!<br/>

  Fool. O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than<br/>

this<br/>

     rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy<br/>

daughters<br/>

     blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.<br/>

  Lear. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!<br/>

     Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.<br/>

     I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.<br/>

     I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,<br/>

     You owe me no subscription. Then let fall<br/>

     Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,<br/>

     A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.<br/>

     But yet I call you servile ministers,<br/>

     That will with two pernicious daughters join<br/>

     Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head<br/>

     So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!<br/>

  Fool. He that has a house to put 's head in has a good<br/>

head-piece.<br/>

          The codpiece that will house<br/>

            Before the head has any,<br/>

          The head and he shall louse:<br/>

            So beggars marry many.<br/>

          The man that makes his toe<br/>

            What he his heart should make<br/>

          Shall of a corn cry woe,<br/>

            And turn his sleep to wake.<br/>

     For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a<br/>

     glass.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00145">                             Enter Kent.</p>

<p id="id00146">  Lear. No, I will be the pattern of all patience;<br/>

     I will say nothing.<br/>

  Kent. Who's there?<br/>

  Fool. Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and<br/>

a<br/>

     fool.<br/>

  Kent. Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night<br/>

     Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies<br/>

     Gallow the very wanderers of the dark<br/>

     And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,<br/>

     Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,<br/>

     Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never<br/>

     Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry<br/>

     Th' affliction nor the fear.<br/>

  Lear. Let the great gods,<br/>

     That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,<br/>

     Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,<br/>

     That hast within thee undivulged crimes<br/>

     Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;<br/>

     Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue<br/>

     That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake<br/>

     That under covert and convenient seeming<br/>

     Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,<br/>

     Rive your concealing continents, and cry<br/>

     These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man<br/>

     More sinn'd against than sinning.<br/>

  Kent. Alack, bareheaded?<br/>

     Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;<br/>

     Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.<br/>

     Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house<br/>

     (More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,<br/>

     Which even but now, demanding after you,<br/>

     Denied me to come in) return, and force<br/>

     Their scanted courtesy.<br/>

  Lear. My wits begin to turn.<br/>

     Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?<br/>

     I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?<br/>

     The art of our necessities is strange,<br/>

     That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.<br/>

     Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart<br/>

     That's sorry yet for thee.<br/>

  Fool. [sings]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00147">          He that has and a little tiny wit-<br/>

            With hey, ho, the wind and the rain-<br/>

          Must make content with his fortunes fit,<br/>

             For the rain it raineth every day.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00148">  Lear. True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.<br/>

                                         Exeunt [Lear and Kent].<br/>

  Fool. This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a<br/>

     prophecy ere I go:<br/>

          When priests are more in word than matter;<br/>

          When brewers mar their malt with water;<br/>

          When nobles are their tailors' tutors,<br/>

          No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;<br/>

          When every case in law is right,<br/>

          No squire in debt nor no poor knight;<br/>

          When slanders do not live in tongues,<br/>

          Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;<br/>

          When usurers tell their gold i' th' field,<br/>

          And bawds and whores do churches build:<br/>

          Then shall the realm of Albion<br/>

          Come to great confusion.<br/>

          Then comes the time, who lives to see't,<br/>

          That going shall be us'd with feet.<br/>

     This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.<br/>

Exit.<br/>

<p id="id00151">  Glou. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing!<br/>

When<br/>

     I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from<br/>

me<br/>

  Edm. Most savage and unnatural!<br/>

  Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the<br/>

Dukes,<br/>

     night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter<br/>

in<br/>

     my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be<br/>

revenged<br/>

     home; there's part of a power already footed; we must<br/>

incline to<br/>

     the King. I will seek him and privily relieve him. Go you<br/>

and<br/>

     maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him<br/>

     perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.<br/>

Though I<br/>

     die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old<br/>

master<br/>

     must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward,<br/>

Edmund.<br/>

     Pray you be careful.                                  Exit.<br/>

  Edm. This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke<br/>

     Instantly know, and of that letter too.<br/>

     This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me<br/>

     That which my father loses- no less than all.<br/>

     The younger rises when the old doth fall.             Exit.<br/>

The heath. Before a hovel.</h2>

<p id="id00153">Storm still. Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.</p>

<p id="id00154">  Kent. Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.<br/>

     The tyranny of the open night 's too rough<br/>

     For nature to endure.<br/>

  Lear. Let me alone.<br/>

  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.<br/>

  Lear. Wilt break my heart?<br/>

  Kent. I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.<br/>

  Lear. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm<br/>

     Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;<br/>

     But where the greater malady is fix'd,<br/>

     The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;<br/>

     But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,<br/>

     Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,<br/>

     The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind<br/>

     Doth from my senses take all feeling else<br/>

     Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!<br/>

     Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand<br/>

     For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!<br/>

     No, I will weep no more. In such a night<br/>

     'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.<br/>

     In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!<br/>

     Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!<br/>

     O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!<br/>

     No more of that.<br/>

  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.<br/>

  Lear. Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.<br/>

     This tempest will not give me leave to ponder<br/>

     On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.<br/>

     [To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-<br/>

     Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.<br/>

                                                    Exit [Fool].<br/>

     Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,<br/>

     That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,<br/>

     How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,<br/>

     Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you<br/>

     From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en<br/>

     Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;<br/>

     Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,<br/>

     That thou mayst shake the superflux to them<br/>

<p id="id00158" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%">  Edg. Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp
hawthorn
     blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm
thee.
  Lear. Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou
come
     to this?
  Edg. Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath
led
     through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool,
o'er
     bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
     halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him
proud
     of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd
     bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy
five
     wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from
     whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
charity,
     whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and
there-
     and there again- and there!
                                                    Storm still.
  Lear. What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
     Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?
  Fool. Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.
  Lear. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
     Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
  Kent. He hath no daughters, sir.
  Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature
     To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
     Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
     Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
     Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot
     Those pelican daughters.
  Edg. Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo,
loo!
  Fool. This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
  Edg. Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy
word
     justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set
not
     thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold.
  Lear. What hast thou been?
  Edg. A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my
hair,
     wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart
and
     did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I
spake
     words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that
     slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine
lov'd
     I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.
     False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth,
fox
     in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in
prey.
     Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks
betray
     thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy
hand
     out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the
foul
     fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says
     suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa!
let
     him trot by.
                                                    Storm still.
  Lear. Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with
thy
     uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more
than
     this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the
beast
     no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's
three
     on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself;
     unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked
     animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton
     here.
                                         [Tears at his clothes.]
  Fool. Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to
swim
     in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old
lecher's
     heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. Look,
here
     comes a walking fire.</p>

                                            [Servants bind him.]<br/>

  Reg. Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!<br/>

  Glou. Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none.<br/>

  Corn. To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find-<br/>

                                       [Regan plucks his beard.]<br/>

  Glou. By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done<br/>

     To pluck me by the beard.<br/>

  Reg. So white, and such a traitor!<br/>

  Glou. Naughty lady,<br/>

     These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin<br/>

     Will quicken, and accuse thee. I am your host.<br/>

     With robber's hands my hospitable favours<br/>

     You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?<br/>

  Corn. Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?<br/>

  Reg. Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.<br/>

  Corn. And what confederacy have you with the traitors<br/>

     Late footed in the kingdom?<br/>

  Reg. To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?<br/>

     Speak.<br/>

  Glou. I have a letter guessingly set down,<br/>

     Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,<br/>

     And not from one oppos'd.<br/>

  Corn. Cunning.<br/>

  Reg. And false.<br/>

  Corn. Where hast thou sent the King?<br/>

  Glou. To Dover.<br/>

  Reg. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-<br/>

  Corn. Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.<br/>

  Glou. I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.<br/>

  Reg. Wherefore to Dover, sir?<br/>

  Glou. Because I would not see thy cruel nails<br/>

     Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister<br/>

     In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.<br/>

     The sea, with such a storm as his bare head<br/>

     In hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up<br/>

     And quench'd the steeled fires.<br/>

     Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.<br/>

     If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,<br/>

     Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.'<br/>

     All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall see<br/>

     The winged vengeance overtake such children.<br/>

  Corn. See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.<br/>

     Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.<br/>

  Glou. He that will think to live till he be old,<br/>

     Give me some help!- O cruel! O ye gods!<br/>

  Reg. One side will mock another. Th' other too!<br/>

  Corn. If you see vengeance-<br/>

  1. Serv. Hold your hand, my lord!<br/>

     I have serv'd you ever since I was a child;<br/>

     But better service have I never done you<br/>

     Than now to bid you hold.<br/>

  Reg. How now, you dog?<br/>

  1. Serv. If you did wear a beard upon your chin,<br/>

     I'ld shake it on this quarrel.<br/>

  Reg. What do you mean?<br/>

  Corn. My villain!                               Draw and fight.<br/>

  1. Serv. Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.<br/>

  Reg. Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?<br/>

                        She takes a sword and runs at him behind.<br/>

  1. Serv. O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left<br/>

     To see some mischief on him. O!                     He dies.<br/>

  Corn. Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!<br/>

     Where is thy lustre now?<br/>

  Glou. All dark and comfortless! Where's my son Edmund?<br/>

     Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature<br/>

     To quit this horrid act.<br/>

  Reg. Out, treacherous villain!<br/>

     Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he<br/>

     That made the overture of thy treasons to us;<br/>

     Who is too good to pity thee.<br/>

  Glou. O my follies! Then Edgar was abus'd.<br/>

     Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!<br/>

  Reg. Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell<br/>

     His way to Dover.<br/>

                                     Exit [one] with Gloucester.<br/>

     How is't, my lord? How look you?<br/>

  Corn. I have receiv'd a hurt. Follow me, lady.<br/>

     Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave<br/>

     Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace.<br/>

     Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.<br/>

                                  Exit [Cornwall, led by Regan].<br/>

  2. Serv. I'll never care what wickedness I do,<br/>

     If this man come to good.<br/>

  3. Serv. If she live long,<br/>

     And in the end meet the old course of death,<br/>

     Women will all turn monsters.<br/>

  2. Serv. Let's follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam<br/>

     To lead him where he would. His roguish madness<br/>

     Allows itself to anything.<br/>

  3. Serv. Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs<br/>

     To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!<br/>

                                                         Exeunt.<br/>

<p id="id00188">Enter Edgar.</p>

<p id="id00189">  Edg. Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,<br/>

     Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,<br/>

     The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,<br/>

     Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.<br/>

     The lamentable change is from the best;<br/>

     The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,<br/>

     Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!<br/>

     The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst<br/>

     Owes nothing to thy blasts.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00190">                 Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.</p>

<p id="id00191">     But who comes here?<br/>

     My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!<br/>

     But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,<br/>

     Life would not yield to age.<br/>

  Old Man. O my good lord,<br/>

     I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,<br/>

     These fourscore years.<br/>

  Glou. Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone.<br/>

     Thy comforts can do me no good at all;<br/>

     Thee they may hurt.<br/>

  Old Man. You cannot see your way.<br/>

  Glou. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;<br/>

     I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen<br/>

     Our means secure us, and our mere defects<br/>

     Prove our commodities. Ah dear son Edgar,<br/>

     The food of thy abused father's wrath!<br/>

     Might I but live to see thee in my touch,<br/>

     I'ld say I had eyes again!<br/>

  Old Man. How now? Who's there?<br/>

  Edg. [aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?<br/>

     I am worse than e'er I was.<br/>

  Old Man. 'Tis poor mad Tom.<br/>

  Edg. [aside] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not<br/>

     So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'<br/>

  Old Man. Fellow, where goest?<br/>

  Glou. Is it a beggarman?<br/>

  Old Man. Madman and beggar too.<br/>

  Glou. He has some reason, else he could not beg.<br/>

     I' th' last night's storm I such a fellow saw,<br/>

     Which made me think a man a worm. My son<br/>

     Came then into my mind, and yet my mind<br/>

     Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.<br/>

     As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods.<br/>

     They kill us for their sport.<br/>

  Edg. [aside] How should this be?<br/>

     Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,<br/>

     Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!<br/>

  Glou. Is that the naked fellow?<br/>

  Old Man. Ay, my lord.<br/>

  Glou. Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sake<br/>

     Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain<br/>

     I' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;<br/>

     And bring some covering for this naked soul,<br/>

     Who I'll entreat to lead me.<br/>

  Old Man. Alack, sir, he is mad!<br/>

  Glou. 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.<br/>

     Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.<br/>

     Above the rest, be gone.<br/>

  Old Man. I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,<br/>

     Come on't what will.                                  Exit.<br/>

  Glou. Sirrah naked fellow-<br/>

  Edg. Poor Tom's acold. [Aside] I cannot daub it further.<br/>

  Glou. Come hither, fellow.<br/>

  Edg. [aside] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.<br/>

  Glou. Know'st thou the way to Dover?<br/>

  Edg. Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath<br/>

been<br/>

     scar'd out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man's son,<br/>

from<br/>

     the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once:<br/>

of<br/>

     lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu,<br/>

of<br/>

     stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and<br/>

     mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women.<br/>

So,<br/>

     bless thee, master!<br/>

  Glou. Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues<br/>

     Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched<br/>

     Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still!<br/>

     Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,<br/>

     That slaves your ordinance, that will not see<br/>

     Because he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly;<br/>

     So distribution should undo excess,<br/>

     And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?<br/>

  Edg. Ay, master.<br/>

  Glou. There is a cliff, whose high and bending head<br/>

     Looks fearfully in the confined deep.<br/>

     Bring me but to the very brim of it,<br/>

     And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear<br/>

     With something rich about me. From that place<br/>

     I shall no leading need.<br/>

  Edg. Give me thy arm.<br/>

     Poor Tom shall lead thee.<br/>

                                                         Exeunt.<br/>

<h2 id="id00192" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene II.
Before the Duke of Albany's Palace.</h2>

<p id="id00193">Enter Goneril and [Edmund the] Bastard.</p>

<p id="id00194">  Gon. Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband<br/>

     Not met us on the way.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00195">                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.</p>

<p id="id00196">     Now, where's your master?<br/>

  Osw. Madam, within, but never man so chang'd.<br/>

     I told him of the army that was landed:<br/>

     He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming:<br/>

     His answer was, 'The worse.' Of Gloucester's treachery<br/>

     And of the loyal service of his son<br/>

     When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot<br/>

     And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out.<br/>

     What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;<br/>

     What like, offensive.<br/>

  Gon. [to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.<br/>

     It is the cowish terror of his spirit,<br/>

     That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs<br/>

     Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way<br/>

     May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.<br/>

     Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs.<br/>

     I must change arms at home and give the distaff<br/>

     Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant<br/>

     Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear<br/>

     (If you dare venture in your own behalf)<br/>

     A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]<br/>

     Spare speech.<br/>

     Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,<br/>

     Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.<br/>

     Conceive, and fare thee well.<br/>

  Edm. Yours in the ranks of death!                        Exit.<br/>

  Gon. My most dear Gloucester!<br/>

     O, the difference of man and man!<br/>

     To thee a woman's services are due;<br/>

     My fool usurps my body.<br/>

  Osw. Madam, here comes my lord.                          Exit.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00197">                            Enter Albany.</p>

<p id="id00198">  Gon. I have been worth the whistle.<br/>

  Alb. O Goneril,<br/>

     You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br/>

     Blows in your face! I fear your disposition.<br/>

     That nature which contemns it origin<br/>

     Cannot be bordered certain in itself.<br/>

     She that herself will sliver and disbranch<br/>

     From her material sap, perforce must wither<br/>

     And come to deadly use.<br/>

  Gon. No more! The text is foolish.<br/>

  Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;<br/>

     Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?<br/>

     Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?<br/>

     A father, and a gracious aged man,<br/>

     Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,<br/>

     Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.<br/>

     Could my good brother suffer you to do it?<br/>

     A man, a prince, by him so benefited!<br/>

     If that the heavens do not their visible spirits<br/>

     Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,<br/>

     It will come,<br/>

     Humanity must perforce prey on itself,<br/>

     Like monsters of the deep.<br/>

  Gon. Milk-liver'd man!<br/>

     That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;<br/>

     Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning<br/>

     Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st<br/>

     Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd<br/>

     Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?<br/>

     France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,<br/>

     With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,<br/>

     Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest<br/>

     'Alack, why does he so?'<br/>

  Alb. See thyself, devil!<br/>

     Proper deformity seems not in the fiend<br/>

     So horrid as in woman.<br/>

  Gon. O vain fool!<br/>

  Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!<br/>

     Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitness<br/>

     To let these hands obey my blood,<br/>

     They are apt enough to dislocate and tear<br/>

     Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,<br/>

     A woman's shape doth shield thee.<br/>

  Gon. Marry, your manhood mew!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00199">                          Enter a Gentleman.</p>

<p id="id00200">  Alb. What news?<br/>

  Gent. O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead,<br/>

     Slain by his servant, going to put out<br/>

     The other eye of Gloucester.<br/>

  Alb. Gloucester's eyes?<br/>

  Gent. A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,<br/>

     Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword<br/>

     To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,<br/>

     Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;<br/>

     But not without that harmful stroke which since<br/>

     Hath pluck'd him after.<br/>

  Alb. This shows you are above,<br/>

     You justicers, that these our nether crimes<br/>

     So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester!<br/>

     Lose he his other eye?<br/>

  Gent. Both, both, my lord.<br/>

     This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.<br/>

     'Tis from your sister.<br/>

  Gon. [aside] One way I like this well;<br/>

     But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,<br/>

     May all the building in my fancy pluck<br/>

     Upon my hateful life. Another way<br/>

     The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer.<br/>

Exit.<br/>

  Alb. Where was his son when they did take his eyes?<br/>

  Gent. Come with my lady hither.<br/>

  Alb. He is not here.<br/>

  Gent. No, my good lord; I met him back again.<br/>

  Alb. Knows he the wickedness?<br/>

  Gent. Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him,<br/>

     And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment<br/>

     Might have the freer course.<br/>

  Alb. Gloucester, I live<br/>

     To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King,<br/>

     And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend.<br/>

     Tell me what more thou know'st.<br/>

                                                         Exeunt.<br/>

<h2 id="id00201" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene III.
The French camp near Dover.</h2>

<p id="id00202">Enter Kent and a Gentleman.</p>

<p id="id00203">  Kent. Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you<br/>

the<br/>

     reason?<br/>

  Gent. Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his<br/>

     coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so<br/>

much<br/>

     fear and danger that his personal return was most required<br/>

and<br/>

     necessary.<br/>

  Kent. Who hath he left behind him general?<br/>

  Gent. The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.<br/>

  Kent. Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of<br/>

     grief?<br/>

  Gent. Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,<br/>

     And now and then an ample tear trill'd down<br/>

     Her delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queen<br/>

     Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,<br/>

     Sought to be king o'er her.<br/>

  Kent. O, then it mov'd her?<br/>

  Gent. Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove<br/>

     Who should express her goodliest. You have seen<br/>

     Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears<br/>

     Were like, a better way. Those happy smilets<br/>

     That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know<br/>

     What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence<br/>

     As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,<br/>

     Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,<br/>

     If all could so become it.<br/>

  Kent. Made she no verbal question?<br/>

  Gent. Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father<br/>

     Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;<br/>

     Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters!<br/>

     Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night?<br/>

     Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook<br/>

     The holy water from her heavenly eyes,<br/>

     And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started<br/>

     To deal with grief alone.<br/>

  Kent. It is the stars,<br/>

     The stars above us, govern our conditions;<br/>

     Else one self mate and mate could not beget<br/>

     Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?<br/>

  Gent. No.<br/>

  Kent. Was this before the King return'd?<br/>

  Gent. No, since.<br/>

  Kent. Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;<br/>

     Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers<br/>

     What we are come about, and by no means<br/>

     Will yield to see his daughter.<br/>

  Gent. Why, good sir?<br/>

  Kent. A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,<br/>

     That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her<br/>

     To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights<br/>

     To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting<br/>

     His mind so venomously that burning shame<br/>

     Detains him from Cordelia.<br/>

  Gent. Alack, poor gentleman!<br/>

  Kent. Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?<br/>

  Gent. 'Tis so; they are afoot.<br/>

  Kent. Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear<br/>

     And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause<br/>

     Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.<br/>

     When I am known aright, you shall not grieve<br/>

     Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go<br/>

     Along with me.                                      Exeunt.<br/>

     Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,<br/>

     With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flow'rs,<br/>

     Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow<br/>

     In our sustaining corn. A century send forth.<br/>

     Search every acre in the high-grown field<br/>

        wisdom<br/>

     He that helps him take all my outward worth.<br/>

     Our foster nurse of nature is repose,<br/>

     The which he lacks. That to provoke in him<br/>

  Osw. I know not, lady.<br/>

  Reg. Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.<br/>

     It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,<br/>

     To let him live. Where he arrives he moves<br/>

     All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,<br/>

  Osw. I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.<br/>

  Reg. Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.<br/>

     The ways are dangerous.<br/>

  Osw. I may not, madam.<br/>

     My lady charg'd my duty in this business.<br/>

  Reg. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you<br/>

     Transport her purposes by word? Belike,<br/>

     Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-<br/>

     Let me unseal the letter.<br/>

  Osw. Madam, I had rather-<br/>

  Reg. I know your lady does not love her husband;<br/>

     I am sure of that; and at her late being here<br/>

     She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks<br/>

     To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.<br/>

  Osw. I, madam?<br/>

  Reg. I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.<br/>

     Therefore I do advise you take this note.<br/>

     My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,<br/>

     And more convenient is he for my hand<br/>

     Than for your lady's. You may gather more.<br/>

     If you do find him, pray you give him this;<br/>

     And when your mistress hears thus much from you,<br/>

     I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.<br/>

     So farewell.<br/>

     If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,<br/>

     Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.<br/>

  Osw. Would I could meet him, madam! I should show<br/>

     What party I do follow.<br/>

  Reg. Fare thee well.                                   Exeunt.<br/>

<h2 id="id00212" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene VI.
The country near Dover.</h2>

<p id="id00213">Enter Gloucester, and Edgar [like a Peasant].</p>

<p id="id00214">  Glou. When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?<br/>

  Edg. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.<br/>

  Glou. Methinks the ground is even.<br/>

  Edg. Horrible steep.<br/>

     Hark, do you hear the sea?<br/>

  Glou. No, truly.<br/>

  Edg. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect<br/>

     By your eyes' anguish.<br/>

  Glou. So may it be indeed.<br/>

     Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st<br/>

     In better phrase and matter than thou didst.<br/>

  Edg. Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd<br/>

     But in my garments.<br/>

  Glou. Methinks y'are better spoken.<br/>

  Edg. Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful<br/>

     And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!<br/>

     The crows and choughs that wing the midway air<br/>

     Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down<br/>

     Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!<br/>

     Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.<br/>

     The fishermen that walk upon the beach<br/>

     Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,<br/>

     Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy<br/>

     Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge<br/>

     That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes<br/>

     Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,<br/>

     Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight<br/>

     Topple down headlong.<br/>

  Glou. Set me where you stand.<br/>

  Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a foot<br/>

     Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon<br/>

     Would I not leap upright.<br/>

  Glou. Let go my hand.<br/>

     Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel<br/>

     Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods<br/>

     Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;<br/>

     Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.<br/>

  Edg. Now fare ye well, good sir.<br/>

  Glou. With all my heart.<br/>

  Edg. [aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair<br/>

     Is done to cure it.<br/>

  Glou. O you mighty gods!                            He kneels.<br/>

     This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,<br/>

     Shake patiently my great affliction off.<br/>

     If I could bear it longer and not fall<br/>

     To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,<br/>

     My snuff and loathed part of nature should<br/>

     Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!<br/>

     Now, fellow, fare thee well.<br/>

                                  He falls [forward and swoons].<br/>

  Edg. Gone, sir, farewell.-<br/>

     And yet I know not how conceit may rob<br/>

     The treasury of life when life itself<br/>

     Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,<br/>

     By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?<br/>

     Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-<br/>

     Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.<br/>

     What are you, sir?<br/>

  Glou. Away, and let me die.<br/>

  Edg. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,<br/>

     So many fadom down precipitating,<br/>

     Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;<br/>

     Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.<br/>

     Ten masts at each make not the altitude<br/>

     Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.<br/>

     Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.<br/>

  Glou. But have I fall'n, or no?<br/>

  Edg. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.<br/>

     Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far<br/>

     Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.<br/>

  Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!<br/>

     Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit<br/>

     To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort<br/>

     When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage<br/>

     And frustrate his proud will.<br/>

  Edg. Give me your arm.<br/>

     Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.<br/>

  Glou. Too well, too well.<br/>

  Edg. This is above all strangeness.<br/>

     Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that<br/>

     Which parted from you?<br/>

  Glou. A poor unfortunate beggar.<br/>

  Edg. As I stood here below, methought his eyes<br/>

     Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,<br/>

     Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea.<br/>

     It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,<br/>

     Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours<br/>

     Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.<br/>

  Glou. I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear<br/>

     Affliction till it do cry out itself<br/>

     'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,<br/>

     I took it for a man. Often 'twould say<br/>

     'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.<br/>

  Edg. Bear free and patient thoughts.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00215">         Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds].</p>

<p id="id00216">     But who comes here?<br/>

     The safer sense will ne'er accommodate<br/>

     His master thus.<br/>

  Lear. No, they cannot touch me for coming;<br/>

     I am the King himself.<br/>

  Edg. O thou side-piercing sight!<br/>

  Lear. Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press<br/>

     money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw<br/>

me<br/>

     a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this<br/>

piece<br/>

     of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove<br/>

it<br/>

     on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!<br/>

i'<br/>

     th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.<br/>

  Edg. Sweet marjoram.<br/>

  Lear. Pass.<br/>

  Glou. I know that voice.<br/>

  Lear. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a<br/>

dog,<br/>

     and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones<br/>

     were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay'<br/>

and<br/>

     'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me<br/>

     once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder<br/>

would<br/>

     not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt<br/>

'em<br/>

     out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I<br/>

was<br/>

     everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof.<br/>

  Glou. The trick of that voice I do well remember.<br/>

     Is't not the King?<br/>

  Lear. Ay, every inch a king!<br/>

     When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.<br/>

     I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?<br/>

     Adultery?<br/>

     Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.<br/>

     The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly<br/>

     Does lecher in my sight.<br/>

     Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son<br/>

     Was kinder to his father than my daughters<br/>

     Got 'tween the lawful sheets.<br/>

     To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.<br/>

     Behold yond simp'ring dame,<br/>

     Whose face between her forks presageth snow,<br/>

     That minces virtue, and does shake the head<br/>

     To hear of pleasure's name.<br/>

     The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't<br/>

     With a more riotous appetite.<br/>

     Down from the waist they are Centaurs,<br/>

     Though women all above.<br/>

     But to the girdle do the gods inherit,<br/>

     Beneath is all the fiend's.<br/>

     There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;<br/>

     burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah,<br/>

pah!<br/>

     Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my<br/>

     imagination. There's money for thee.<br/>

  Glou. O, let me kiss that hand!<br/>

  Lear. Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.<br/>

  Glou. O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world<br/>

     Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?<br/>

  Lear. I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at<br/>

me?<br/>

     No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this<br/>

     challenge; mark but the penning of it.<br/>

  Glou. Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.<br/>

  Edg. [aside] I would not take this from report. It is,<br/>

     And my heart breaks at it.<br/>

  Lear. Read.<br/>

  Glou. What, with the case of eyes?<br/>

  Lear. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor<br/>

no<br/>

     money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your<br/>

purse<br/>

     in a light. Yet you see how this world goes.<br/>

  Glou. I see it feelingly.<br/>

  Lear. What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no<br/>

eyes.<br/>

     Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond<br/>

     simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and,<br/>

handy-dandy,<br/>

     which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a<br/>

     farmer's dog bark at a beggar?<br/>

  Glou. Ay, sir.<br/>

  Lear. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst<br/>

behold<br/>

     the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.<br/>

     Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!<br/>

     Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.<br/>

     Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind<br/>

     For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.<br/>

     Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;<br/>

     Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,<br/>

     And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;<br/>

     Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.<br/>

     None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.<br/>

     Take that of me, my friend, who have the power<br/>

     To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes<br/>

     And, like a scurvy politician, seem<br/>

     To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!<br/>

     Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So.<br/>

  Edg. O, matter and impertinency mix'd!<br/>

     Reason, in madness!<br/>

  Lear. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.<br/>

     I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.<br/>

     Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;<br/>

     Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air<br/>

     We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.<br/>

  Glou. Alack, alack the day!<br/>

  Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come<br/>

     To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.<br/>

     It were a delicate stratagem to shoe<br/>

     A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,<br/>

     And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,<br/>

     Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!<br/>

<p id="id00218">  Gent. O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,<br/>

     Your most dear daughter-<br/>

  Lear. No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even<br/>

     The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;<br/>

     You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;<br/>

     I am cut to th' brains.<br/>

  Gent. You shall have anything.<br/>

  Lear. No seconds? All myself?<br/>

     Why, this would make a man a man of salt,<br/>

     To use his eyes for garden waterpots,<br/>

     Ay, and laying autumn's dust.<br/>

  Gent. Good sir-<br/>

  Lear. I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!<br/>

     I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;<br/>

     My masters, know you that?<br/>

  Gent. You are a royal one, and we obey you.<br/>

  Edg. Hail, gentle sir.<br/>

  Gent. Sir, speed you. What's your will?<br/>

  Edg. Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?<br/>

  Gent. Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that<br/>

     Which can distinguish sound.<br/>

  Edg. But, by your favour,<br/>

     How near's the other army?<br/>

  Gent. Near and on speedy foot. The main descry<br/>

     Stands on the hourly thought.<br/>

  Edg. I thank you sir. That's all.<br/>

  Gent. Though that the Queen on special cause is here,<br/>

     Her army is mov'd on.<br/>

  Edg. I thank you, sir<br/>

                                               Exit [Gentleman].<br/>

  Glou. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;<br/>

     Let not my worser spirit tempt me again<br/>

     To die before you please!<br/>

  Edg. Well pray you, father.<br/>

  Glou. Now, good sir, what are you?<br/>

  Edg. A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,<br/>

     Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,<br/>

     Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;<br/>

     I'll lead you to some biding.<br/>

     What place this is; and all the skill I have<br/>

     Remembers not these garments; nor I know not<br/>

     Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;<br/>

     For (as I am a man) I think this lady<br/>

     To be my child Cordelia.<br/>

  Cor. And so I am! I am!<br/>

  Lear. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.<br/>

     If you have poison for me, I will drink it.<br/>

     I know you do not love me; for your sisters<br/>

     Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.<br/>

     You have some cause, they have not.<br/>

  Cor. No cause, no cause.<br/>

  Lear. Am I in France?<br/>

  Kent. In your own kingdom, sir.<br/>

  Lear. Do not abuse me.<br/>

  Doct. Be comforted, good madam. The great rage<br/>

     You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger<br/>

     To make him even o'er the time he has lost.<br/>

     Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more<br/>

     Till further settling.<br/>

  Cor. Will't please your Highness walk?<br/>

  Lear. You must bear with me.<br/>

     Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.<br/>

                              Exeunt. Manent Kent and Gentleman.<br/>

  Gent. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so<br/>

slain?<br/>

  Kent. Most certain, sir.<br/>

  Gent. Who is conductor of his people?<br/>

  Kent. As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.<br/>

  Gent. They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of<br/>

Kent<br/>

     in Germany.<br/>

  Kent. Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers<br/>

of<br/>

     the kingdom approach apace.<br/>

  Gent. The arbitrement is like to be bloody.<br/>

     Fare you well, sir.                                 [Exit.]<br/>

  Kent. My point and period will be throughly wrought,<br/>

     Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.        Exit.<br/>

     You know the goodness I intend upon you.<br/>

     Tell me- but truly- but then speak the truth-<br/>

     Do you not love my sister?<br/>

  Edm. In honour'd love.<br/>

  Reg. But have you never found my brother's way<br/>

     To the forfended place?<br/>

  Edm. That thought abuses you.<br/>

  Reg. I am doubtful that you have been conjunct<br/>

     And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.<br/>

  Edm. No, by mine honour, madam.<br/>

  Reg. I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,<br/>

  Alb. Our very loving sister, well bemet.<br/>

     Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,<br/>

     With others whom the rigour of our state<br/>

     Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest,<br/>

     I never yet was valiant. For this business,<br/>

     It toucheth us as France invades our land,<br/>

     Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,<br/>

     Most just and heavy causes make oppose.<br/>

  Edm. Sir, you speak nobly.<br/>

  Reg. Why is this reason'd?<br/>

  Gon. Combine together 'gainst the enemy;<br/>

     For these domestic and particular broils<br/>

     Are not the question here.<br/>

  Alb. Let's then determine<br/>

     With th' ancient of war on our proceeding.<br/>

  Edm. I shall attend you presently at your tent.<br/>

  Reg. Sister, you'll go with us?<br/>

  Gon. No.<br/>

  Reg. 'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us.<br/>

  Edg. Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.<br/>

     If you have victory, let the trumpet sound<br/>

     For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,<br/>

     I can produce a champion that will prove<br/>

     What is avouched there. If you miscarry,<br/>

     Your business of the world hath so an end,<br/>

     And machination ceases. Fortune love you!<br/>

  Alb. Stay till I have read the letter.<br/>

  Edg. I was forbid it.<br/>

     When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,<br/>

     And I'll appear again.<br/>

  Alb. Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.<br/>

     Here is the guess of their true strength and forces<br/>

     By diligent discovery; but your haste<br/>

     Is now urg'd on you.<br/>

  Alb. We will greet the time.                             Exit.<br/>

  Edm. To both these sisters have I sworn my love;<br/>

     Each jealous of the other, as the stung<br/>

     Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?<br/>

     Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,<br/>

     If both remain alive. To take the widow<br/>

     Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;<br/>

     And hardly shall I carry out my side,<br/>

     Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use<br/>

     His countenance for the battle, which being done,<br/>

     Let her who would be rid of him devise<br/>

     His speedy taking off. As for the mercy<br/>

     Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia-<br/>

     The battle done, and they within our power,<br/>

     Shall never see his pardon; for my state<br/>

     Stands on me to defend, not to debate.                Exit.<br/>

as prisoners; Soldiers, Captain.</p>

<p id="id00247">  Edm. Some officers take them away. Good guard<br/>

     Until their greater pleasures first be known<br/>

     That are to censure them.<br/>

  Cor. We are not the first<br/>

     Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.<br/>

     For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;<br/>

     Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.<br/>

     Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?<br/>

  Lear. No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.<br/>

     We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.<br/>

     When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down<br/>

     And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,<br/>

     And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh<br/>

     At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues<br/>

     Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-<br/>

     Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out-<br/>

     And take upon 's the mystery of things,<br/>

     As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,<br/>

     In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones<br/>

     That ebb and flow by th' moon.<br/>

  Edm. Take them away.<br/>

  Lear. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,<br/>

     The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?<br/>

     He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven<br/>

     And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.<br/>

     The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,<br/>

     Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.<br/>

     Come.                  Exeunt [Lear and Cordelia, guarded].<br/>

  Edm. Come hither, Captain; hark.<br/>

     Take thou this note [gives a paper]. Go follow them to<br/>

prison.<br/>

     One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost<br/>

     As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way<br/>

     To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men<br/>

     Are as the time is. To be tender-minded<br/>

     Does not become a sword. Thy great employment<br/>

     Will not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't,<br/>

     Or thrive by other means.<br/>

  Capt. I'll do't, my lord.<br/>

  Edm. About it! and write happy when th' hast done.<br/>

     Mark- I say, instantly; and carry it so<br/>

     As I have set it down.<br/>

  Capt. I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;<br/>

<p id="id00248">          Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers.</p>

<p id="id00249">  Alb. Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,<br/>

     And fortune led you well. You have the captives<br/>

     Who were the opposites of this day's strife.<br/>

     We do require them of you, so to use them<br/>

     As we shall find their merits and our safety<br/>

     May equally determine.<br/>

  Edm. Sir, I thought it fit<br/>

     To send the old and miserable King<br/>

     To some retention and appointed guard;<br/>

     Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,<br/>

     To pluck the common bosom on his side<br/>

     And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes<br/>

     Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,<br/>

     My reason all the same; and they are ready<br/>

     To-morrow, or at further space, t' appear<br/>

     Where you shall hold your session. At this time<br/>

     We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;<br/>

     And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd<br/>

     By those that feel their sharpness.<br/>

     The question of Cordelia and her father<br/>

     Requires a fitter place.<br/>

  Alb. Sir, by your patience,<br/>

     I hold you but a subject of this war,<br/>

     Not as a brother.<br/>

  Reg. That's as we list to grace him.<br/>

     Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded<br/>

     Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,<br/>

     Bore the commission of my place and person,<br/>

     The which immediacy may well stand up<br/>

     And call itself your brother.<br/>

  Gon. Not so hot!<br/>

     In his own grace he doth exalt himself<br/>

     More than in your addition.<br/>

  Reg. In my rights<br/>

     By me invested, he compeers the best.<br/>

  Gon. That were the most if he should husband you.<br/>

  Reg. Jesters do oft prove prophets.<br/>

  Gon. Holla, holla!<br/>

     That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.<br/>

  Reg. Lady, I am not well; else I should answer<br/>

     From a full-flowing stomach. General,<br/>

     Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;<br/>

     Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.<br/>

     Witness the world that I create thee here<br/>

     My lord and master.<br/>

  Gon. Mean you to enjoy him?<br/>

  Alb. The let-alone lies not in your good will.<br/>

  Edm. Nor in thine, lord.<br/>

  Alb. Half-blooded fellow, yes.<br/>

  Reg. [to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00250">  Alb. Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee<br/>

     On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,<br/>

     This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim,<br/>

fair<br/>

        sister,<br/>

     I bar it in the interest of my wife.<br/>

     'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,<br/>

     And I, her husband, contradict your banes.<br/>

     If you will marry, make your loves to me;<br/>

     My lady is bespoke.<br/>

  Gon. An interlude!<br/>

  Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.<br/>

     If none appear to prove upon thy person<br/>

     Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,<br/>

     There is my pledge [throws down a glove]! I'll prove it on<br/>

thy<br/>

        heart,<br/>

     Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less<br/>

     Than I have here proclaim'd thee.<br/>

  Reg. Sick, O, sick!<br/>

  Gon. [aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.<br/>

  Edm. There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the<br/>

world<br/>

        he is<br/>

     That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.<br/>

     Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,<br/>

     On him, on you, who not? I will maintain<br/>

     My truth and honour firmly.<br/>

  Alb. A herald, ho!<br/>

  Edm. A herald, ho, a herald!<br/>

  Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,<br/>

     All levied in my name, have in my name<br/>

     Took their discharge.<br/>

  Reg. My sickness grows upon me.<br/>

  Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.<br/>

</p>

<p id="id00251">                           Enter a Herald.</p>

<p id="id00252">     Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,<br/>

  Capt. Sound, trumpet!                        A trumpet sounds.<br/>

sound<br/>

     of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'<br/>

  Her. Again!                                     Third trumpet.<br/>

<p id="id00256">  Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appears<br/>

     Upon this call o' th' trumpet.<br/>

  Her. What are you?<br/>

     Your name, your quality? and why you answer<br/>

     This present summons?<br/>

  Edg. Know my name is lost;<br/>

     By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.<br/>

     Yet am I noble as the adversary<br/>

     I come to cope.<br/>

  Alb. Which is that adversary?<br/>

  Edg. What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?<br/>

  Edm. Himself. What say'st thou to him?<br/>

  Edg. Draw thy sword,<br/>

     That, if my speech offend a noble heart,<br/>

     Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.<br/>

     Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,<br/>

     My oath, and my profession. I protest-<br/>

     Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,<br/>

     Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,<br/>

     Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor;<br/>

     False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;<br/>

     Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;<br/>

     And from th' extremest upward of thy head<br/>

     To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,<br/>

     A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'<br/>

     This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent<br/>

     To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,<br/>

     Thou liest.<br/>

  Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name;<br/>

     But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,<br/>

     And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,<br/>

     What safe and nicely I might well delay<br/>

     By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.<br/>

     Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;<br/>

     With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;<br/>

     Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-<br/>

     This sword of mine shall give them instant way<br/>

     Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!<br/>

                                 Alarums. Fight. [Edmund falls.]<br/>

  Alb. Save him, save him!<br/>

  Gon. This is mere practice, Gloucester.<br/>

     By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer<br/>

     An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,<br/>

     But cozen'd and beguil'd.<br/>

  Alb. Shut your mouth, dame,<br/>

     Or with this paper shall I stop it. [Shows her her letter to<br/>

     Edmund.]- [To Edmund]. Hold, sir.<br/>

     [To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.<br/>

     No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it.<br/>

  Gon. Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.<br/>

     Who can arraign me for't?<br/>

  Alb. Most monstrous!<br/>

     Know'st thou this paper?<br/>

  Gon. Ask me not what I know.                             Exit.<br/>

  Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.<br/>

                                              [Exit an Officer.]<br/>

  Edm. What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,<br/>

     And more, much more. The time will bring it out.<br/>

     'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou<br/>

     That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,<br/>

     I do forgive thee.<br/>

  Edg. Let's exchange charity.<br/>

     I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;<br/>

     If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.<br/>

     My name is Edgar and thy father's son.<br/>

     The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices<br/>

     Make instruments to scourge us.<br/>

     The dark and vicious place where thee he got<br/>

     Cost him his eyes.<br/>

  Edm. Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.<br/>

     The wheel is come full circle; I am here.<br/>

  Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy<br/>

     A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.<br/>

     Let sorrow split my heart if ever I<br/>

     Did hate thee, or thy father!<br/>

  Edg. Worthy prince, I know't.<br/>

  Alb. Where have you hid yourself?<br/>

     How have you known the miseries of your father?<br/>

  Edg. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;<br/>

     And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!<br/>

     The bloody proclamation to escape<br/>

     That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!<br/>

     That with the pain of death would hourly die<br/>

     Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift<br/>

     Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance<br/>

     That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit<br/>

     Met I my father with his bleeding rings,<br/>

     Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,<br/>

     Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;<br/>

     Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him<br/>

     Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd,<br/>

     Not sure, though hoping of this good success,<br/>

     I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last<br/>

     Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart<br/>

     (Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)<br/>

     'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,<br/>

     Burst smilingly.<br/>

  Edm. This speech of yours hath mov'd me,<br/>

     And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;<br/>

     You look as you had something more to say.<br/>

  Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;<br/>

     For I am almost ready to dissolve,<br/>

     Hearing of this.<br/>

  Edg. This would have seem'd a period<br/>

     To such as love not sorrow; but another,<br/>

     To amplify too much, would make much more,<br/>

     And top extremity.<br/>

     Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man,<br/>

     Who, having seen me in my worst estate,<br/>

     Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding<br/>

     Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms<br/>

     He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out<br/>

     As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;<br/>

     Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him<br/>

     That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting<br/>

     His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life<br/>

     Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,<br/>

     And there I left him tranc'd.<br/>

  Alb. But who was this?<br/>

  Edg. Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise<br/>

     Followed his enemy king and did him service<br/>

     Improper for a slave.<br/>

  Edg. What kind of help?<br/>

  Alb. Speak, man.<br/>

  Edg. What means that bloody knife?<br/>

  Gent. 'Tis hot, it smokes.<br/>

     It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!<br/>

  Alb. Who dead? Speak, man.<br/>

  Gent. Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister<br/>

     By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.<br/>

  Edm. I was contracted to them both. All three<br/>

     Now marry in an instant.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00259">                             Enter Kent.</p>

<p id="id00260">  Edg. Here comes Kent.<br/>

  Alb. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.<br/>

                                               [Exit Gentleman.]<br/>

     This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble<br/>

     Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?<br/>

     The time will not allow the compliment<br/>

     That very manners urges.<br/>

  Kent. I am come<br/>

     To bid my king and master aye good night.<br/>

     Is he not here?<br/>

  Alb. Great thing of us forgot!<br/>

     Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?<br/>

                 The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.<br/>

     Seest thou this object, Kent?<br/>

  Kent. Alack, why thus?<br/>

  Edm. Yet Edmund was belov'd.<br/>

     The one the other poisoned for my sake,<br/>

     And after slew herself.<br/>

  Alb. Even so. Cover their faces.<br/>

  Edm. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,<br/>

     Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send<br/>

     (Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ<br/>

     Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.<br/>

     Nay, send in time.<br/>

  Alb. Run, run, O, run!<br/>

  Edg. To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send<br/>

     Thy token of reprieve.<br/>

  Edm. Well thought on. Take my sword;<br/>

     Give it the Captain.<br/>

  Alb. Haste thee for thy life.                    [Exit Edgar.]<br/>

  Edm. He hath commission from thy wife and me<br/>

     To hang Cordelia in the prison and<br/>

     To lay the blame upon her own despair<br/>

     That she fordid herself.<br/>

  Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.<br/>

                                          [Edmund is borne off.]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00261">    Enter Lear, with Cordelia [dead] in his arms, [Edgar,<br/>

Captain,<br/>

                        and others following].<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00262">  Lear. Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.<br/>

     Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so<br/>

     That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!<br/>

     I know when one is dead, and when one lives.<br/>

     She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.<br/>

     If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,<br/>

     Why, then she lives.<br/>

  Kent. Is this the promis'd end?<br/>

  Edg. Or image of that horror?<br/>

  Alb. Fall and cease!<br/>

  Lear. This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,<br/>

     It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows<br/>

     That ever I have felt.<br/>

  Kent. O my good master!<br/>

  Lear. Prithee away!<br/>

  Edg. 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.<br/>

  Lear. A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!<br/>

     I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!<br/>

     Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!<br/>

     What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,<br/>

     Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.<br/>

     I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.<br/>

  Capt. 'Tis true, my lords, he did.<br/>

  Lear. Did I not, fellow?<br/>

     I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion<br/>

     I would have made them skip. I am old now,<br/>

     And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?<br/>

     Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.<br/>

  Kent. If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,<br/>

     One of them we behold.<br/>

  Lear. This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?<br/>

  Kent. The same-<br/>

     Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?<br/>

  Lear. He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.<br/>

     He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.<br/>

  Kent. No, my good lord; I am the very man-<br/>

  Lear. I'll see that straight.<br/>

  Kent. That from your first of difference and decay<br/>

     Have followed your sad steps.<br/>

  Lear. You're welcome hither.<br/>

  Kent. Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.<br/>

     Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,<br/>

     And desperately are dead.<br/>

  Lear. Ay, so I think.<br/>

  Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is it<br/>

     That we present us to him.<br/>

  Edg. Very bootless.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00263">                           Enter a Captain.</p>

<p id="id00264">  Capt. Edmund is dead, my lord.<br/>

  Alb. That's but a trifle here.<br/>

     You lords and noble friends, know our intent.<br/>

     What comfort to this great decay may come<br/>

     Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,<br/>

     During the life of this old Majesty,<br/>

     To him our absolute power; [to Edgar and Kent] you to your<br/>

        rights;<br/>

     With boot, and Such addition as your honours<br/>

     Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste<br/>

     The wages of their virtue, and all foes<br/>

     The cup of their deservings.- O, see, see!<br/>

  Lear. And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!<br/>

     Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,<br/>

     And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,<br/>

     Never, never, never, never, never!<br/>

     Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.<br/>

     Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!<br/>

     Look there, look there!                            He dies.<br/>

  Edg. He faints! My lord, my lord!<br/>

  Kent. Break, heart; I prithee break!<br/>

  Edg. Look up, my lord.<br/>

  Kent. Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him<br/>

     That would upon the rack of this tough world<br/>

     Stretch him out longer.<br/>

  Edg. He is gone indeed.<br/>

  Kent. The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.<br/>

     He but usurp'd his life.<br/>

  Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business<br/>

     Is general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you<br/>

        twain<br/>

     Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.<br/>

  Kent. I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.<br/>

     My master calls me; I must not say no.<br/>

  Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,<br/>

     Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.<br/>

     The oldest have borne most; we that are young<br/>

     Shall never see so much, nor live so long.<br/>

                                       Exeunt with a dead march.<br/>
