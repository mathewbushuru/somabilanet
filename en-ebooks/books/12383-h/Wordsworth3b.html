<h2><a name="section12"></a>1805</h2>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">During 1805, the autobiographical poem, which was afterwards named by
Mrs. Wordsworth <a href="Wordsworth3c.html#section24"><i>The Prelude</i></a>, was finished. In that year also
Wordsworth wrote the <a href="#section14"><i>Ode to Duty</i></a>, <a href="#section15"><i>To a Sky-Lark</i></a>, <a href="#section16"><i>Fidelity</i></a>, the
fourth poem <a href="#section19"><i>To the Daisy</i></a>, the <a href="#section20"><i>Elegiac Stanzas suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle in a Storm</i></a>, the <a href="#section21"><i>Elegiac Verses</i></a> in memory of his
brother John, <a href="#section23"><i>The Waggoner</i></a>, and a few other poems.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<h2><a name="section13"></a>French Revolution</h2>

<h4>As it Appeared to Enthusiasts at its Commencement<br>
<br>
Reprinted from <i>The Friend</i></h4>

<h4>Composed 1805.&mdash;Published 1809</h4>

<a href="#section13a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[An extract from the long poem on my own poetical education. It was
first published by Coleridge in his <i>Friend</i>, which is the reason of its
having had a place in every edition of my poems since.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">These lines appeared first in <i>The Friend</i>, No. 11, October 26, 1809, p.
163. They afterwards found a place amongst the "Poems of the
Imagination," in all the collective editions from 1815 onwards. They are
part of the <a href="Wordsworth3c.html#24b11">eleventh book</a> of <i>The Prelude</i>, entitled
"France&mdash;(concluded)," ll. 105-144. Wordsworth gives the date 1805, but
these lines possibly belong to the year 1804.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy!<br>
For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood<br>
Upon our side, we who were strong in love!<br>
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,<br>
But to be young was very heaven!&mdash;Oh! times,   <br>
In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways<br>
Of custom, law, and statute, took at once<br>
The attraction of a country in romance!<br>
When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights,<br>
When most intent on making of herself      <br>
A prime Enchantress&mdash;to assist the work,<br>
Which then was going forward in her name!<br>
Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth,<br>
The beauty wore of promise, that which sets<br>
(As at some moment might not be unfelt    <br>
Among the bowers of paradise itself)<br>
The budding rose above the rose full blown.<br>
What temper at the prospect did not wake<br>
To happiness unthought of? The inert<br>
Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!    <br>
They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,<br>
The playfellows of fancy, who had made<br>
All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength<br>
Their ministers,&mdash;who in lordly wise had stirred<br>
Among the grandest objects of the sense,       <br>
And dealt with whatsoever they found there<br>
As if they had within some lurking right<br>
To wield it;&mdash;they, too, who, of gentle mood,<br>
Had watched all gentle motions, and to these<br>
Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,    <br>
And in the region of their peaceful selves;&mdash;<br>
Now was it that both found, the meek and lofty<br>
Did both find, helpers to their heart's desire,<br>
And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish;<br>
Were called upon to exercise their skill,        <br>
Not in Utopia, subterranean fields,<br>
Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!<br>
But in the very world, which is the world<br>
Of all of us,&mdash;the place where in the end<br>
We find our happiness, or not at all!<br>

quoting this poem,</span>

 <blockquote> "My feelings and imagination did not remain unkindled in this general
 conflagration; and I confess I should be more inclined to be ashamed
 than proud of myself if they had! I was a sharer in the general
 vortex, though my little world described the path of its revolution in
 an orbit of its own," etc.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="section14"></a>Ode to Duty</h2>

<h4>Composed 1805.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section14a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
 <blockquote><i> "<a name="fr14A">Jam</a> non consilio bonus, sed more e&ograve; perductus, ut non tantum rect&egrave;
 facere possim, sed nisi rect&egrave; facere non possim." </i><a href="#14A"><sup>A</sup></a></blockquote>

<span style="color: #663300;">[This Ode is on the model of Gray's <i>Ode to Adversity</i>, which
is copied from Horace's <i>Ode</i> to Fortune. Many and many a
time have I been twitted by my wife and sister for having
forgotten this dedication of myself to the stern law-giver.
Transgressor indeed I have been from hour to hour, from day
to day: I would fain hope, however, not more flagrantly, or
in a worse way than most of my tuneful brethren. But these
last words are in a wrong strain. We should be rigorous to
ourselves, and forbearing, if not indulgent, to others; and, if
we make comparison at all, it ought to be with those who have
morally excelled us.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>
<br>
In pencil on the MS., 

 <blockquote> "But is not the first stanza of Gray's from a chorus of &AElig;schylus? And
 is not Horace's Ode also modelled on the Greek?"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This poem was placed by Wordsworth among his "Poems of Sentiment and
Reflection."&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<td>Stern Daughter of the Voice of God!<br>
O Duty! if that name thou love<br>
Who art a light to guide, a rod<br>
To check the erring, and reprove;<br>
Thou, who art victory and law      <br>
When empty terrors overawe;<br>
From vain temptations dost set free;<br>
And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity! <br><br>

There are who ask not if thine eye<br>
Be on them; who, in love and truth,     <br>
Where no misgiving is, rely<br>
Upon the genial sense of youth: <br>
Glad Hearts! without reproach or blot;<br>
Who do thy work, and know it not:<br>
Oh, if through confidence misplaced     <br>
They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast. <br><br>

Serene will be our days and bright,<br>
And happy will our nature be,<br>
When love is an unerring light,<br>
And joy its own security.               <br>
And they a blissful course may hold<br>
Even now, who, not unwisely bold, <br>
Live in the spirit of this creed;<br>
Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need.<br><br>

I, loving freedom, and untried;            <br>
No sport of every random gust,<br>
Yet being to myself a guide,<br>
Too blindly have reposed my trust:<br>
And oft, when in my heart was heard<br>
Thy timely mandate, I deferred            <br>
The task, in smoother walks to stray; <br>
But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may.<br><br>

Through no disturbance of my soul,<br>
Or strong compunction in me wrought,<br>
I supplicate for thy control;            <br>
But in the quietness of thought:<br>
Me this unchartered freedom tires; <br>
I feel the weight of chance-desires:<br>
My hopes no more must change their name,<br>
I long for a repose that ever is the same.    <br>
<br>
Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear<br>
The Godhead's most benignant grace;<br>
Nor know we any thing so fair<br>
As is the smile upon thy face: <br>
Flowers laugh before thee on their beds    <br>
And fragrance in thy footing treads; <br>
Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong;<br>
And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong.<br><br>

To humbler functions, awful Power!<br>
I call thee: I myself commend            <br>
Unto thy guidance from this hour;<br>
Oh, let my weakness have an end!<br>
Give unto me, made lowly wise,<br>
The spirit of self-sacrifice;<br>
The confidence of reason give;            <br>
And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live! <br>

sheets of the edition of 1807, which was cancelled by Wordsworth, in

edition:</span>


 <blockquote>'There are who tread a blameless way<br>
 In purity, and love, and truth,<br>
 Though resting on no better stay<br>
 Than on the genial sense of youth:<br>
 Glad Hearts! without reproach or blot;<br>
 Who do the right, and know it not:<br>
 May joy be theirs while life shall last<br>
 And may a genial sense remain, when youth is past.<br>
 <br>
 Serene would be our days and bright;<br>
 And happy would our nature be;<br>
 If Love were an unerring light;<br>
 And Joy its own security.<br>
 And bless'd are they who in the main,<br>
 This creed, even now, do entertain,<br>
 Do in this spirit live; yet know<br>
 That Man hath other hopes; strength which elsewhere must grow.<br>
 <br>
 I, loving freedom, and untried;<br>
 No sport of every random gust,<br>
 Yet being to myself a guide,<br>
 Too blindly have reposed my trust;<br>
 Resolv'd that nothing e'er should press<br>
 Upon my present happiness,<br>
 I shov'd unwelcome tasks away:<br>
 But henceforth I would serve; and strictly if I may.<br>
 <br>
 O <a name="fr14G">Power</a> of <b>Duty</b>! sent from God<br>
 To enforce on earth his high behest,<br>
 And keep us faithful to the road<br>
 Which conscience hath pronounc'd the best:<br>
 Thou, who art Victory and Law<br>
 When empty terrors overawe;<br>
 From vain temptations dost set free,<br>
 From Strife, and from Despair, a glorious Ministry!<a href="#14G"><sup>G</sup></a>'</blockquote>

<td>Up with me! up with me into the clouds!<br>
  For thy song, Lark, is strong;<br>
Up with me, up with me into the clouds!<br>
   Singing, singing,<br>
With clouds and sky about thee ringing,         <br>
  Lift me, guide me till I find<br>
That spot which seems so to thy mind!<br><br>

I have walked through wildernesses dreary,<br>
And to-day my heart is weary;<br>
Had I now the wings of a Faery,          <br>
Up to thee would I fly.<br>
There is madness about thee, and joy divine<br>
In that song of thine;<br>
Lift me, guide me high and high <br>
To thy banqueting-place in the sky.          <br><br>

    Joyous as morning, <br>
Thou art laughing and scorning;<br>
Thou hast a nest for thy love and thy rest,<br>
And, though little troubled with sloth,<br>
Drunken Lark! thou would'st be loth          <br>
To be such a traveller as I.<br>
Happy, happy Liver,<br>
With a soul as strong as a mountain river<br>
Pouring out praise to the almighty Giver,<br>
  Joy and jollity be with us both!         <br><br>

Alas! my journey, rugged and uneven,<br>
Through prickly moors or dusty ways must wind;<br>
But hearing thee, or others of thy kind,<br>
As full of gladness and as free of heaven,<br>
I, with my fate contented, will plod on,         <br>
And hope for higher raptures, when life's day is done. <br>

<h2><a name="section16"></a>Fidelity</h2>

<h4>Composed 1805.&mdash;Published 1807</h4>

<a href="#section16a">The Poem</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #663300;">[The young man whose death gave occasion to this poem was named Charles
Gough, and had come early in the spring to Patterdale for the sake of
angling. While attempting to cross over Helvellyn to Grasmere he slipped
from a steep part of the rock where the ice was not thawed, and
perished. His body was discovered as described in this poem. Walter
Scott heard of the accident, and both he and I, without either of us
knowing that the other had taken up the subject, each wrote a poem in
admiration of the dog's fidelity. His contains a most beautiful stanza:</span>

 <blockquote> "How long did'st thou think that his silence was slumber!<br>
 When the wind waved his garment how oft did'st thou start!"</blockquote>

<span style="color: #663300;">I will add that the sentiment in the last four lines of the last stanza
of my verses was uttered by a shepherd with such exactness, that a
traveller, who afterwards reported his account in print, was induced to
question the man whether he had read them, which he had not.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br>

<td>A barking sound the Shepherd hears,<br>
A cry as of a dog or fox;<br>
He halts&mdash;and searches with his eyes<br>
Among the scattered rocks:<br>
And now at distance can discern  <br>
A stirring in a brake of fern;<br>
And instantly a dog is seen,<br>
Glancing through that covert green. <br><br>

The Dog is not of mountain breed;<br>
Its motions, too, are wild and shy;  <br>
With something, as the Shepherd thinks,<br>
Unusual in its cry:<br>
Nor is there any one in sight<br>
All round, in hollow or on height;<br>
Nor shout, nor whistle strikes his ear;  <br>
What is the creature doing here?<br><br>

It was a cove, a huge recess,<br>
That keeps, till June, December's snow;<br>
A lofty precipice in front,<br>
A silent tarn below!   <br>
Far in the bosom of Helvellyn,<br>
Remote from public road or dwelling,<br>
Pathway, or cultivated land;<br>
From trace of human foot or hand.<br><br>

There sometimes doth a leaping fish  <br>
Send through the tarn a lonely cheer;<br>
The crags repeat the raven's croak, <br>
In symphony austere;<br>
Thither the rainbow comes&mdash;the cloud&mdash;<br>
And mists that spread the flying shroud;       <br>
And sunbeams; and the sounding blast,<br>
That, if it could, would hurry past;<br>
But that enormous barrier holds it fast.<br><br>

Not free from boding thoughts, a while<br>
The Shepherd stood; then makes his way        <br>
O'er rocks and stones, following the Dog <br>
As quickly as he may;<br>
Nor far had gone before he found<br>
A human skeleton on the ground;<br>
The appalled Discoverer with a sigh        <br>
Looks round, to learn the history.<br><br>

From those abrupt and perilous rocks<br>
The Man had fallen, that place of fear!<br>
At length upon the Shepherd's mind<br>
It breaks, and all is clear:             <br>
He instantly recalled the name, <br>
And who he was, and whence he came;<br>
Remembered, too, the very day<br>
On which the Traveller passed this way.<br><br>

But hear a wonder, for whose sake         <br>
This lamentable tale I tell! <br>
A lasting monument of words<br>
This wonder merits well.<br>
The Dog, which still was hovering nigh,<br>
Repeating the same timid cry,           <br>
This Dog, had been through three months' space<br>
A dweller in that savage place.<br><br>

Yes, proof was plain that, since the day<br>
When this ill-fated Traveller died, <br>
The Dog had watched about the spot,        <br>
Or by his master's side:<br>
How nourished here through such long time<br>
He knows, who gave that love sublime;<br>
And gave that strength of feeling, great<br>
Above all human estimate!             <br>

Wordsworth here describes Red Tarn, under Helvellyn, to the east; but
Charles Gough was killed on the Kepplecove side of Swirell Edge, and not
at Red Tarn. Bishop Watson of Llandaff, writing to Hayley (see
<i>Anecdotes of the Life of Bishop Watson</i>, p. 440), writes about Charles
Gouche (evidently Gough). He had been lodging at "the Cherry Inn," near

incident with feeling, but without inspiration. Gough perished early in
April, and his body was not found till July 22nd, 1805. A reference to
his fate will be found in Lockhart's <i>Life of Scott</i> (vol. ii. p. 274);
also in a letter of Mr. Luff of Patterdale, to his wife, July 23rd,
1805. Henry Crabb Robinson records (see his <i>Diary, Reminiscences</i>,

of this poem, that "he purposely made the narrative as prosaic as
possible, in order that no discredit might be thrown on the truth of the

<td>On his morning rounds the Master<br>
Goes to learn how all things fare;<br>
Searches pasture after pasture,<br>
Sheep and cattle eyes with care;<br>
And, for silence or for talk,            <br>
He hath comrades in his walk;<br>
Four dogs, each pair of different breed,<br>
Distinguished two for scent, and two for speed.<br><br>

See a hare before him started!<br>
&mdash;Off they fly in earnest chase;                 <br>
Every dog is eager-hearted,<br>
All the four are in the race:<br>
And the hare whom they pursue,<br>
Knows from instinct what to do;<br>
Her hope is near: no turn she makes;             <br>
But, like an arrow, to the river takes.<br><br>

Deep the river was, and crusted<br>
Thinly by a one night's frost;<br>
But the nimble Hare hath trusted<br>
To the ice, and safely crost; so     <br>
She hath crost, and without heed<br>
All are following at full speed,<br>
When, lo! the ice, so thinly spread,<br>
Breaks&mdash;and the greyhound, <b>Dart</b>, is over-head!<br><br>

Better fate have <b>Prince</b> and <b>Swallow&mdash;</b>     <br>
See them cleaving to the sport!<br>
<b>Music</b> has no heart to follow,<br>
Little <b>Music</b>, she stops short.<br>
She hath neither wish nor heart,<br>
Hers is now another part:         <br>
A loving creature she, and brave!<br>
And fondly strives her struggling friend to save.<br><br>

From the brink her paws she stretches,<br>
Very hands as you would say!<br>
And afflicting moans she fetches,     <br>
As he breaks the ice away.<br>
For herself she hath no fears,&mdash;<br>
Him alone she sees and hears,&mdash;<br>
Makes efforts with complainings; nor gives o'er<br>
Until her fellow sinks to re-appear no more.<br>

<td>Lie here, without a record of thy worth,<br>
Beneath a covering of the common earth!<br>
It is not from unwillingness to praise,<br>
Or want of love, that here no Stone we raise;<br>
More thou deserv'st; but <i>this</i> man gives to man,    <br>
Brother to brother, <i>this</i> is all we can.<br>
Yet they to whom thy virtues made thee dear<br>
Shall find thee through all changes of the year:<br>
This Oak points out thy grave; the silent tree<br>
Will gladly stand a monument of thee.    <br><br>

  We grieved for thee, and wished thy end were past;<br>
And willingly have laid thee here at last:<br>
For thou hadst lived till every thing that cheers<br>
In thee had yielded to the weight of years;<br>
Extreme old age had wasted thee away,    <br>
And left thee but a glimmering of the day;<br>
Thy ears were deaf, and feeble were thy knees,&mdash;<br>
I saw thee stagger in the summer breeze,<br>
Too weak to stand against its sportive breath,<br>
And ready for the gentlest stroke of death.    <br>
It came, and we were glad; yet tears were shed;<br>
Both man and woman wept when thou wert dead;<br>
Not only for a thousand thoughts that were,<br>
Old household thoughts, in which thou hadst thy share;<br>
But for some precious boons vouchsafed to thee,    <br>
Found scarcely any where in like degree!<br>
For love, that comes wherever life and sense<br>
Are given by God, in thee was most intense;<br>
A chain of heart, a feeling of the mind,<br>
A tender sympathy, which did thee bind    <br>
Not only to us Men, but to thy Kind:<br>
Yea, for thy fellow-brutes in thee we saw<br>
A soul of love, love's intellectual law:&mdash;<br>
Hence, if we wept, it was not done in shame;<br>
Our tears from passion and from reason came,    <br>
And, therefore, shalt thou be an honoured name!<br>

<td>Sweet Flower! belike one day to have<br>
A place upon thy Poet's grave,<br>
I welcome thee once more:<br>
But He, who was on land, at sea,<br>
My Brother, too, in loving thee,    <br>
Although he loved more silently,<br>
Sleeps by his native shore.<br><br>

Ah! hopeful, hopeful was the day<br>
When to that Ship he bent his way,<br>
To govern and to guide:    <br>
His wish was gained: a little time<br>
Would bring him back in manhood's prime<br>
And free for life, these hills to climb;<br>
With all his wants supplied.<br><br>

And full of hope day followed day    <br>
While that stout Ship at anchor lay<br>
Beside the shores of Wight;<br>
The May had then made all things green;<br>
And, floating there, in pomp serene,<br>
That Ship was goodly to be seen,    <br>
His pride and his delight!<br><br>

Yet then, when called ashore, he sought<br>
The tender peace of rural thought:<br>
In more than happy mood<br>
To your abodes, bright daisy Flowers!    <br>
He then would steal at leisure hours,<br>
And loved you glittering in your bowers,<br>
A starry multitude.<br><br>

But hark the word!&mdash;the ship is gone;&mdash;<br>
Returns from her long course:&mdash;anon    <br>
Sets sail:&mdash;in season due,<br>
Once more on English earth they stand:<br>
But, when a third time from the land<br>
They parted, sorrow was at hand<br>
For Him and for his crew.    <br><br>

Ill-fated Vessel!&mdash;ghastly shock!<br>
&mdash;At length delivered from the rock,<br>
The deep she hath regained;<br>
And through the stormy night they steer;<br>
Labouring for life, in hope and fear,    <br>
To reach a safer shore&mdash;how near,<br>
Yet not to be attained!<br><br>

"Silence!" the brave Commander cried;<br>
To that calm word a shriek replied,<br>
It was the last death-shriek.      <br>
&mdash;A few (my soul oft sees that sight)<br>
Survive upon the tall mast's height;<br>
But one dear remnant of the night&mdash;<br>
For Him in vain I seek.<br><br>

Six weeks beneath the moving sea      <br>
He lay in slumber quietly;<br>
Unforced by wind or wave<br>
To quit the Ship for which he died,<br>
(All claims of duty satisfied;)<br>
And there they found him at her side;      <br>
And bore him to the grave.<br><br>

Vain service! yet not vainly done<br>
For this, if other end were none,<br>
That He, who had been cast<br>
Upon a way of life unmeet       <br>
For such a gentle Soul and sweet,<br>
Should find an undisturbed retreat<br>
Near what he loved, at last&mdash;<br><br>

That neighbourhood of grove and field<br>
To Him a resting-place should yield,      <br>
A meek man and a brave!<br>
The birds shall sing and ocean make<br>
A mournful murmur for <i>his</i> sake;<br>
And Thou, sweet Flower, shalt sleep and wake<br>
Upon his senseless grave.<br>

<td>I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile!<br>
Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee:<br>
I saw thee every day; and all the while<br>
Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.<br><br>

So pure the sky, so quiet was the air!    <br>
So like, so very like, was day to day!<br>
Whene'er I looked, thy Image still was there;<br>
It trembled, but it never passed away.<br><br>

How perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep;<br>
No mood, which season takes away, or brings:    <br>
I could have fancied that the mighty Deep<br>
Was even the gentlest of all gentle Things.<br><br>

Ah! <b>Then</b>, if mine had been the Painter's hand,<br>
To express what then I saw; and add the gleam,<br>
The light that never was, on sea or land,    <br>
The consecration, and the Poet's dream;<br><br>

I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile<br>
Amid a world how different from this!<br>
Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;<br>
On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss.     <br><br>

Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine<br>
Of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;&mdash;<br>
Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine<br>
The very sweetest had to thee been given.<br><br>

A Picture had it been of lasting ease,     <br>
Elysian quiet, without toil or strife;<br>
No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,<br>
Or merely silent Nature's breathing life.<br><br>

Such, in the fond illusion of my heart,<br>
Such Picture would I at that time have made:     <br>
And seen the soul of truth in every part,<br>
A stedfast peace that might not be betrayed.<br><br>

So once it would have been,&mdash;'tis so no more;<br>
I have submitted to a new control:<br>
A power is gone, which nothing can restore;    <br>
A deep distress hath humanised my Soul.<br><br>

Not for a moment could I now behold<br>
A smiling sea, and be what I have been:<br>
The feeling of my loss will ne'er be old;<br>
This, which I know, I speak with mind serene.     <br><br>

Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the Friend,<br>
If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore,<br>
This work of thine I blame not, but commend;<br>
This sea in anger, and that dismal shore.<br><br>

O 'tis a passionate Work!&mdash;yet wise and well,     <br>
Well chosen is the spirit that is here;<br>
That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell,<br>
This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!<br><br>

And this huge Castle, standing here sublime,<br>
 love to see the look with which it braves,     <br>
Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time,<br>
The lightning, the fierce wind, and trampling waves.<br><br>

Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,<br>
Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind!<br>
Such happiness, wherever it be known,      <br>
Is to be pitied; for 'tis surely blind.<br><br>

But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,<br>
And frequent sights of what is to be borne!<br>
Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.&mdash;<br>
Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.     <br>

 <blockquote> "Have you noted how the two lines, 'The light that never was,' etc.,
  stood in the edition of 1827? I know no other such instance of a
  change from commonplace to perfection of ideality."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">The Principal had not remembered at the time that the "perfection of
ideality" was in the original edition of 1807. The curious thing is that
the prosaic version of 1820 and 1827 ever took its place. Wordsworth's
return to his original reading was one of the wisest changes he
introduced into the text of 1832.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="20n1"></a><i><b>Note:</b></i> &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">There is a Peele Castle, on a small rocky island, close to the town of
Peele, in the Isle of Man; yet separated from it, much as St. Michael's
Mount in Cornwall is separated from the mainland. This castle was
believed by many to be the one which Sir George painted, and which gave
rise to the foregoing lines. I visited it in 1879, being then ignorant
that any other Peele Castle existed; and although, the day being calm,
and the season summer, I thought Sir George had idealized his subject
much&mdash;(as I had just left Coleorton, where the picture still exists)&mdash;I
accepted the customary opinion. <a name="fr20B">But</a> I am now convinced, both from the
testimony of the Arnold family<a href="#20B"><sup>B</sup></a>, and as the result of a visit to Piel
Castle, near Barrow in Furness, that Wordsworth refers to it. The late
Bishop of Lincoln, in his uncle's <i>Memoirs</i> (vol. i. p. 299), quotes the
line</span>

  <blockquote>"I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged pile," </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">and adds, </span>

 <blockquote> "He had spent four weeks there of a college summer vacation at the
  house of his cousin, Mr. Barker."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">This house was at Rampside, the village opposite Piel, on the coast of
Lancashire. The "rugged pile," too, now "cased in the unfeeling armour
of old time," painted by Beaumont, is obviously this Piel Castle near
Barrow. I took the engraving of his picture with me, when visiting it:
and although Sir George&mdash;after the manner of landscape artists of his
day&mdash;took many liberties with his subjects, it is apparent that it was
this, and not Peele Castle in Mona, that he painted. The "four summer
weeks" referred to in the first stanza, were those spent at Piel during
the year 1794.<br>
<br>
With the last verse of these <i>Elegiac Stanzas</i> compare stanzas ten and
eleven of the <i>Ode, Intimations of Immortality</i>, vol. viii.<br>
<br>
One of the two pictures of "Peele Castle in a Storm"&mdash;engraved by S. W.
Reynolds, and published in the editions of Wordsworth's poems of 1815
and 1820&mdash;is still in the Beaumont Gallery at Coleorton Hall.<br>
<br>
The poem is so memorable that I have arranged to make this picture of
"Peele Castle in a Storm," the vignette to vol. xv. of this edition. It
deserves to be noted that it was to the pleading of Barron Field that we
owe the restoration of the original line of 1807,</span>

 <blockquote> 'The light that never was, on sea or land.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">An interesting account of Piel Castle will be found in Hearne and
Byrne's <i>Antiquities.</i> It was built by the Abbot of Furness in the first
year of the reign of Edward III.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<span style="color: #555555;">The note is as follows:</span>

 <blockquote> "Moss Campion (<i>Silene acaulis</i>). This most beautiful plant is scarce
  in England, though it is found in great abundance upon the mountains
  of Scotland. The first specimen I ever saw of it in its native bed was
  singularly fine, the tuft or cushion being at least eight inches
  diameter, and the root proportionably thick. I have only met with it
  in two places among our mountains, in both of which I have since
  sought for it in vain.<br>
<br>
  Botanists will not, I hope, take it ill, if I caution them against
  carrying off inconsiderately rare and beautiful plants. This has often
  been done, particularly from Ingleborough and other mountains in
  Yorkshire, till the species have totally disappeared, to the great
  regret of lovers of nature living near the places where they
  grew."&mdash;W. W. 1842.</blockquote>

At a meeting of "The Wordsworth Society" held at Grasmere, in July 1881,
it was proposed by one of the members, the Rev. H. D. Rawnsley, then
Vicar of Wray, to erect some memorial at the parting-place of the
brothers. The brothers John and William Wordsworth parted at Grisedale
Tarn, on the 29th September 1800. The originator of the idea wrote thus
of it in June 1882:</span>

  <blockquote>"A proposition, made by one of its members to the Wordsworth Society
  when it met in Grasmere in 1881, to mark the spot in the Grisedale
  Pass of Wordsworth's parting from his brother John&mdash;and to carry out a
  wish the poet seems to have hinted at in the last of his elegiac
  verses in memory of that parting&mdash;is now being put into effect. It has
  been determined, after correspondence with Lord Coleridge, Dr.
  Cradock, Professor Knight, and Mr. Hills, to have inscribed &mdash;(on the
  native rock, if possible)&mdash;the first four lines of Stanzas III. and
  VII. of these verses:

    <blockquote>'Here did we stop; and here looked round<br>
    While each into himself descends,<br>
    For that last thought of parting Friends<br>
    That is not to be found.<br>
    ...<br>
    Brother and friend, if verse of mine<br>
    Have power to make thy virtues known,<br>
    Here let a monumental Stone<br>
    Stand&mdash;sacred as a Shrine.'</blockquote>

  The rock selected is a fine mass, facing the east, on the left of the
  track as one descends from Grisedale Tarn towards Patterdale, and is
  about 100 yards from the tarn. No more suitable one can be found, and
  we have the testimony of Mr. David Richardson of Newcastle, who has
  practical knowledge of engineering, that it is the fittest, both from
  shape and from slight incline of plane.<br>
<br>
  It has been proposed to sink a panel in the face of the rock, that so
  the inscription may be slightly protected, and to engrave the letters
  upon the face of the panel thus obtained. But it is not quite certain
  yet that the grain of the rock&mdash; volcanic ash&mdash;will admit of the
  lettering. If this cannot be carried out, it has been determined to
  have the letters engraved upon a slab of Langdale slate, and imbed it
  in the Grisedale Rock.<br>
<br>
  It is believed that the simplicity of the design, the lonely isolation
  of this mountain memorial, will appeal at once

   <blockquote> ' ... to the few who pass this way,<br>
    Traveller or Shepherd.'</blockquote>

  And we in our turn appeal to English tourists who may chance to see
  it, to forego the wish of adding to it, or taking anything from it, by
  engraving their own names; and to let the Monumental Stone stand, as
  the poet wished it might

   <blockquote> ' ... stand, <b>sacred</b> as a Shrine.'</blockquote>

  We owe great thanks to Mrs. Sturge for first surveying the place, to
  ascertain the possibility of finding a mountain rock sufficiently
  striking in position; to Mr. Richardson, jun., for his etching of the
  rock, upon which the inscription is to be made; to his father for the
  kind trouble he took in the measurement of the said rock; and
  particularly to the seconder of the original proposal, and my
  coadjutor in the task of final selection and superintending the work,
  Mr. W. H. Hills.

  <b>H. D. Rawnsley</b>.

  <i>P. S.</i>&mdash;When we came to examine the rock, we found the area for the
  panel less than we had hoped for, owing to certain rock fissures,
  which, by acting as drains for the rainwater on the surface, would
  have much interfered with the durability of the inscription. The
  available space for the panel remains 3 feet 7 in length by 1 foot 9
  inches in depth. Owing to the fineness of the grain of the stone, it
  may be quite possible to letter the native rock; but it has been
  difficult to fix on a style of lettering for the inscription that
  shall be at once in good taste, forcible, and plain. It was proposed
  that the Script type of letter which was made use of in the
  inscription cut on the rock, in the late Mr. Ball's garden grounds
  below the Mount at Rydal, should be adopted; but a final decision has
  been given in favour of a style of lettering which Mrs. Rawnsley has
  designed. The panel is, from its position, certain to attract the eye
  of the wanderer from Patterdale up to the Grisedale Pass.<br>

The following extract from <i>Recollections from 1803 to 1837, with a
Conclusion in 1868, by the Hon. Amelia Murray</i> (London: Longmans, Green,
and Co. 1868)&mdash;refers to the loss of the <i>Abergavenny:</i></span>

 <blockquote> "One morning, coming down early, I saw what I thought was a great big
  ship without any hull. This was the <i>Abergavenny</i>, East Indiaman,
  which had sunk with all sails set, hardly three miles from the shore,
  and all on board perished.<br>
<br>
  Had any of the crew taken refuge in the main-top, they might have been
  saved; but the bowsprit, which was crowded with human beings, gave a
  lurch into the sea as the ship settled down, and thus all were washed
  off&mdash;though the timber appeared again above water when the
  'Abergavenny' touched the ground. The ship had sprung a leak off St.
  Alban's Head; and in spite of pumps, she went to the bottom just
  within reach of safety." </blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">pp. 12, 13.<br>
<br>
A <i>Narrative of the loss of the "Earl of Abergavenny" East Indiaman, off
Portland, Feb. 5, 1805</i>, was published in pamphlet form (8vo, 1805), by
Hamilton and Bird, 21 High Street, Islington.<br>
<br>
For much in reference to John Wordsworth, which illustrates both these
<i>Elegiac Verses</i>, and the poem "On the Naming of Places" which follows
them, I must refer to his <i>Life</i> to be published in another volume of
this series; but there is one letter of Dorothy Wordsworth's, written to
her friend Miss Jane Pollard (afterwards Mrs. Marshall), in reference to
her brother's death, which may find a place here. For the use of it I am
indebted to the kindness of Mrs. Marshall's daughter, the Dowager Lady
Monteagle:</span>

 <blockquote> "March 16th, 1805. Grasmere.<br>
<br>
  "... It does me good to weep for him, and it does me good to find that
  others weep, and I bless them for it. ... It is with me, when I write,
  as when I am walking out in this vale, once so full of joy. I can turn
  to no object that does not remind me of our loss. I see nothing that
  he would not have loved, and enjoyed.... My consolations rather come
  to me in gusts of feeling, than are the quiet growth of my mind. I
  know it will not always be so. The time will come when the light of
  the setting sun upon these mountain tops will be as heretofore a pure
  joy; not the same <i>gladness</i>, that can never be&mdash;but yet a joy even
  more tender. It will soothe me to know how happy he would have been,
  could he have seen the same beautiful spectacle.... He was taken away
  in the freshness of his manhood; pure he was, and innocent as a child.
  Never human being was more thoroughly modest, and his courage I need
  not speak of. He was 'seen speaking with apparent cheerfulness to the
  first mate a few minutes before the ship went down;' and when nothing
  more could be done, He said, 'the will of God be done.' I have no
  doubt when he felt that it was out of his power to save his life he
  was as calm as before, if some thought of what we should endure did
  not awaken a pang.... He loved solitude, and he rejoiced in society.
  He would wander alone amongst these hills with his fishing-rod, or led
  on by the mere pleasure of walking, for many hours; or he would walk
  with W. or me, or both of us, and was continually pointing out&mdash;with a
  gladness which is seldom seen but in very young people&mdash;something
  which perhaps would have escaped our observation; for he had so fine
  an eye that no distinction was unnoticed by him, and so tender a
  feeling that he never noticed anything in vain. Many a time has he
  called out to me at evening to look at the moon or stars, or a cloudy
  sky, or this vale in the quiet moonlight; but the stars and moon were
  his chief delight. He made of them his companions when he was at sea,
  and was never tired of those thoughts which the silence of the night
  fed in him. Then he was so happy by the fireside. Any little business
  of the house interested him. He loved our cottage. He helped us to
  furnish it, and to make the garden. Trees are growing now which he
  planted.... He staid with us till the 29th of September, having come
  to us about the end of January. During that time Mary Hutchinson&mdash;now
  Mary Wordsworth&mdash;staid with us six weeks. John used to walk with her
  everywhere, and they were exceedingly attached to each other; so my
  poor sister mourns with us, not merely because we have lost one who
  was so dear to William and me, but from tender love to John and an
  intimate knowledge of him. Her hopes as well as ours were fixed on
  John.... I can think of nothing but of our departed Brother, yet I am
  very tranquil to-day. I honour him, and love him, and glory in his
  memory...."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Southey, writing to his friend, C. W. W. Wynn, on the 3rd of April 1805,
says:</span>

 <blockquote> "<b>Dear Wynn</b>,<br>
<br>
  I have been grievously shocked this evening by the loss of the
  <i>Abergavenny</i>, of which Wordsworth's brother was captain. Of course
  the news came flying up to us from all quarters, and it has disordered
  me from head to foot. At such circumstances I believe we feel as much
  for others as for ourselves; just as a violent blow occasions the same
  pain as a wound, and he who breaks his shin feels as acutely at the
  moment as the man whose leg is shot off. In fact, I am writing to you
  merely because this dreadful shipwreck has left me utterly unable to
  do anything else. It is the heaviest calamity Wordsworth has ever
  experienced, and in all probability I shall have to communicate it to
  him, as he will very likely be here before the tidings can reach him.
  What renders any near loss of this kind so peculiarly distressing is,
  that the recollection is perpetually freshened when any like event
  occurs, by the mere mention of shipwreck, or the sound of the wind. Of
  all deaths it is the most dreadful, from the circumstances of terror
  which accompany it...." </blockquote>

<blockquote>(See <i>The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</i>, vol. ii. p. 321.)<br>
<br>
The following is part of a letter from Mary Lamb to Dorothy Wordsworth
on the same subject. It is undated:</blockquote>

 <blockquote> "<b>My Dear Miss Wordsworth</b>,&mdash;<br>
<br>
  I wished to tell you that you would one day feel the kind of peaceful
  state of mind and sweet memory of the dead, which you so happily
  describe, as now almost begun; but I felt that it was improper, and
  most grating to the feelings of the afflicted, to say to them that the
  memory of their affliction would in time become a constant part, not
  only of their dreams, but of their most wakeful sense of happiness.
  That you would see every object with and through your lost brother,
  and that that would at last become a real and everlasting source of
  comfort to you, I felt, and well knew, from my own experience in
  sorrow; but till you yourself began to feel this, I did not dare to
  tell you so; but I send you some poor lines, which I wrote under this
  conviction of mind, and before I heard Coleridge was returning home.<br>
<br>
  ...

    <blockquote>"Why is he wandering on the sea?&mdash;<br>
    Coleridge should now with Wordsworth be.<br>
    By slow degrees he'd steal away<br>
    Their woes, and gently bring a ray<br>
    (So happily he'd time relief,)<br>
    Of comfort from their very grief.<br>
    He'd tell them that their brother dead,<br>
    When years have passed o'er their head,<br>
    Will be remembered with such holy,<br>
    True and tender melancholy,<br>
    That ever this lost brother John<br>
    Will be their heart's companion.<br>
    His voice they'll always hear,<br>
      His face they'll always see;<br>
    There's naught in life so sweet<br>
      As such a memory."</blockquote></blockquote>

<td>When, to the attractions of the busy world,<br>
Preferring studious leisure, I had chosen<br>
A habitation in this peaceful Vale,<br>
Sharp season followed of continual storm<br>
In deepest winter; and, from week to week,           <br>
Pathway, and lane, and public road, were clogged<br>
With frequent showers of snow. Upon a hill<br>
At a short distance from my cottage, stands<br>
A stately Fir-grove, whither I was wont<br>
To hasten, for I found, beneath the roof <br>
Of that perennial shade, a cloistral place<br>
Of refuge, with an unincumbered floor.<br>
Here, in safe covert, on the shallow snow,<br>
And, sometimes, on a speck of visible earth,<br>
The redbreast near me hopped; nor was I loth<br>
To sympathise with vulgar coppice birds<br>
That, for protection from the nipping blast,<br>
Hither repaired.&mdash;A single beech-tree grew<br>
Within this grove of firs! and, on the fork<br>
Of that one beech, appeared a thrush's nest;<br>
A last year's nest, conspicuously built<br>
At such small elevation from the ground<br>
As gave sure sign that they, who in that house<br>
Of nature and of love had made their home<br>
Amid the fir-trees, all the summer long     <br>
Dwelt in a tranquil spot. And oftentimes,<br>
A few sheep, stragglers from some mountain-flock,<br>
Would watch my motions with suspicious stare,<br>
From the remotest outskirts of the grove,&mdash;<br>
Some nook where they had made their final stand,<br>
Huddling together from two fears&mdash;the fear   <br>
Of me and of the storm. Full many an hour<br>
Here did I lose. But in this grove the trees<br>
Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven<br>
In such perplexed and intricate array;      <br>
That vainly did I seek, beneath their stems<br>
A length of open space, where to and fro<br>
My feet might move without concern or care;<br>
And, baffled thus, though earth from day to day<br>
Was fettered, and the air by storm disturbed,           <br>
I ceased the shelter to frequent,&mdash;and prized,<br>
Less than I wished to prize, that calm recess.<br><br>

  The snows dissolved, and genial Spring returned<br>
To clothe the fields with verdure. Other haunts<br>
Meanwhile were mine; till, one bright April day,<br>
By chance retiring from the glare of noon  <br>
To this forsaken covert, there I found<br>
A hoary pathway traced between the trees,<br>
And winding on with such an easy line<br>
Along a natural opening, that I stood      <br>
Much wondering how I could have sought in vain<br>
For what was now so obvious. To abide,<br>
For an allotted interval of ease,<br>
Under my cottage-roof, had gladly come<br>
From the wild sea a cherished Visitant; <br>
And with the sight of this same path&mdash;begun,<br>
Begun and ended, in the shady grove,<br>
Pleasant conviction flashed upon my mind<br>
That, to this opportune recess allured,<br>
He had surveyed it with a finer eye, <br>
A heart more wakeful; and had worn the track<br>
By pacing here, unwearied and alone,<br>
In that habitual restlessness of foot<br>
That haunts the Sailor measuring o'er and o'er<br>
His short domain upon the vessel's deck, <br>
While she pursues her course through the dreary sea.<br>
When thou hadst quitted Esthwaite's pleasant shore,<br>
And taken thy first leave of those green hills<br>
And rocks that were the play-ground of thy youth,<br>
Year followed year, my Brother! and we two, <br>
Conversing not, knew little in what mould<br>
Each other's mind was fashioned; and at length<br>
When once again we met in Grasmere Vale,<br>
Between us there was little other bond<br>
Than common feelings of fraternal love. <br>
But thou, a School-boy, to the sea hadst carried<br>
Undying recollections; Nature there<br>
Was with thee; she, who loved us both, she still<br>
Was with thee; and even so didst thou become<br>
A <i>silent</i> Poet; from the solitude <br>
Of the vast sea didst bring a watchful heart<br>
Still couchant, an inevitable ear,<br>
And an eye practised like a blind man's touch.<br>
&mdash;Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone;<br>
Nor from this vestige of thy musing hours <br>
Could I withhold thy honoured name,&mdash;and now<br>
I love the fir-grove with a perfect love.<br>
Thither do I withdraw when cloudless suns<br>
Shine hot, or wind blows troublesome and strong;<br>
And there I sit at evening, when the steep <br>
Of Silver-how, and Grasmere's peaceful lake,<br>
And one green island, gleam between the stems<br>
Of the dark firs, a visionary scene!<br>
And, while I gaze upon the spectacle<br>
Of clouded splendour, on this dream-like sight <br>
Of solemn loveliness, I think on thee,<br>
My Brother, and on all which thou hast lost.<br>
Nor seldom, if I rightly guess, while Thou,<br>
Muttering the verses which I muttered first<br>
Among the mountains, through the midnight watch<br>
Art pacing thoughtfully the vessel's deck <br>
In some far region, here, while o'er my head,<br>
At every impulse of the moving breeze,<br>
The fir-grove murmurs with a sea-like sound,<br>
Alone I tread this path;&mdash;for aught I know, <br>
Timing my steps to thine; and, with a store<br>
Of undistinguishable sympathies,<br>
Mingling most earnest wishes for the day<br>
When we, and others whom we love, shall meet<br>
A second time, in Grasmere's happy Vale. <br>

by shipwreck, in discharge of his duty as Commander of the Honourable
East India Company's Vessel, the <i>Earl of Abergavenny</i>.&mdash;W. W. 1815.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #555555;">For the date of this poem in the Chronological Tables given in the
editions of 1815 and 1820, Wordsworth assigned the year 1802. But, in
the edition of 1836, he assigned it to the year 1805, the date retained
by Mr. Carter in the edition of 1857. Captain Wordsworth perished on the
5th of February 1805; and if the poem was written in 1805, it must have
been in the month of January of that year. The note to the poem is
explicit&mdash;"Not long after" he "perished by shipwreck," etc. Thus the
poem <i>may</i> have been written in the beginning of 1805; but it is not at
all certain that part of it at least does not belong to an earlier year.
John Wordsworth lived with his brother and sister at the Town-end
Cottage, Grasmere, during part of the winter, and during the whole of
the spring, summer, and autumn of 1800, William and John going together
on foot into Yorkshire from the 14th of May to the 7th of June. John
left Grasmere on Michaelmas day (September 29th) 1800, and never
returned to it again. The following is Miss Wordsworth's record of that
day in her <i>Journal</i> of 1800:</span>

  <blockquote>"On Monday, 29th, John left us. William and I parted with him in sight
  of Ullswater. It was a fine day, showery, but with sunshine and fine
  clouds. Poor fellow, my heart was right sad, I could not help thinking
  we should see him again, because he was only going to Penrith."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the spring of 1801, John Wordsworth sailed for China in the
<i>Abergavenny.</i>  He returned from this voyage in safety, and the brothers
met once again in London. He went to sea again in 1803, and returned to
London in 1804, but could not visit Grasmere; and in the month of
February 1805&mdash;shortly after he was appointed to the command of the
<i>Abergavenny&mdash;</i> the ship was lost at the Bill of Portland, and every one
on board perished. It is clear that the latter part of the poem, "When,
to the attractions of the busy world," was written between John
Wordsworth's departure from Grasmere and the loss of the <i>Abergavenny,
i. e.</i> between September 1800 and February 1805, as there are references
in it both to what his brother did at Grasmere and to his return to
sea:
</span>
 <blockquote> 'Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">There are some things in the earlier part of the poem that appear to
negative the idea of its having been written in 1800. The opening lines
seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant. He speaks of being
"wont" to do certain things. But, on the other hand, I find an entry in
Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i>, which leads me to believe that the poem
may have been begun in 1800, and that the first part, ending (as it did
then) with the line:</span>

 <blockquote> 'While she is travelling through the dreary sea,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">may have been finished before John Wordsworth left Grasmere;
the second part being written afterwards, while he was at sea;
and that this is the explanation of the date given in the editions
of 1815 and 1820, viz. 1802.<br>
<br>
Passages occur in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> to the
following effect:</span>

  <blockquote>"Monday Morning, 1st September.&mdash;We walked in the wood by the lake.
  William read <i>Joanna</i> and <i>the Firgrove</i> to Coleridge."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">A little earlier there is the record,</span>

 <blockquote> "Saturday, 22nd August.&mdash;William was composing all the morning....
  William read us the poem of <i>Joanna</i> beside the Rothay by the
  roadside."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Then, on Friday, the 25th August, there is the entry, </span>

  <blockquote>"We walked over the hill by the Firgrove, I sate upon a rock and
  observed a flight of swallows gathering together high above my head.
  We walked through the wood to the stepping stones, the lake of Rydale
  very beautiful, partly still, I left William to compose an
  inscription, that about the path...."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Then, next day, </span>

 <blockquote> "Saturday morning, 30th August.&mdash;William finished his inscription of
  the Pathway, then walked in the wood, and when John returned he sought
  him, and they bathed together."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">To what poem Dorothy Wordsworth referred under the name of the
"Inscription of the Pathway" has puzzled me much. There is no poem
amongst his "Inscriptions" (written in or before August 1800) that
corresponds to it in the least. But, if my conjecture is right that this
"Poem on the Naming of Places," beginning:</span>

  <blockquote>'When, to the attractions of the busy world,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">was composed at two different times, it is quite possible that "the
Firgrove" which was read&mdash;along with <i>Joanna</i>&mdash;to Coleridge on September
lst, 1800, was the first part of this very poem.<br>
<br>
If this supposition is correct, some light is cast both on the
"Inscription of the Pathway." and on the date assigned by Wordsworth
himself to the poem. There is a certain fitness, however, in this poem
being placed&mdash;as it now is&mdash;in sequence to the <a href="#section21"><i>Elegiac Verses</i></a> in
memory of John Wordsworth, beginning, "The Sheep-boy whistled loud," and
near the fourth poem <a href="#section19"><i>To the Daisy</i></a>, beginning, "Sweet Flower! belike
one day to have."<br>
<br>
The "Fir-grove" still exists. It is between Wishing Gate and White Moss
Common, and almost exactly opposite the former. Standing at the gate and
looking eastwards, the grove is to the left, not forty yards distant.
Some of the firs (Scotch ones) still survive, and several beech trees,
not "a single beech-tree," as in the poem. From this, one might infer
that the present colony had sprung up since the beginning of the
century, and that the special tree, in which was the thrush's nest, had
perished; but Dr. Cradock wrote to me that "Wordsworth pointed out the
tree to Miss Cookson a few days before Dora Wordsworth's death. The tree
is near the upper wall and tells its own tale." The Fir-grove&mdash;"John's
Grove"&mdash; can easily be entered by a gate about a hundred yards beyond
the Wishing-gate, as one goes toward Rydal. The view from it, the
"visionary scene,"</span>

                          <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  'the spectacle<br>
  Of clouded splendour, ... this dream-like sight<br>
  Of solemn loveliness,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">is now much interfered with by the new larch plantations immediately
below the firs. It must have been very different in Wordsworth's time,
and is constantly referred to in his sister's <i>Journal</i> as a favourite
retreat, resorted to</span>

                           <blockquote>'when cloudless suns<br>
  'Shone hot, or wind blew troublesome and strong.'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">In the absence of contrary testimony, it might be supposed that "the
track" which the brother had "worn,"</span>

 <blockquote> 'By pacing here, unwearied and alone,'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">faced Silver-How and the Grasmere Island, and that the single beech tree
was nearer the lower than the upper wall. But Miss Cookson's testimony
is explicit. Only a few fir trees survive at this part of the grove,
which is now open and desolate, not as it was in those earlier days,
when</span>

   <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  'the trees<br>
  Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven<br>
  With such perplexed and intricate array,<br>
  That vainly did I seek, beneath their stems<br>
  A length of open space ...'</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Dr. Cradock remarks, </span>

  <blockquote>"As to there being more than one beech, Wordsworth would not have
  hesitated to sacrifice servile exactness to poetical effect." He had a
  fancy for "one":

   <blockquote> 'Fair as a star when only one<br>
    Is shining in the sky;'</blockquote>

  "'One' abode, no more;" Grasmere's "one green island;" "one green
  field."</blockquote>

<span style="color: #555555;">Since the above note was printed, new light has been cast on the
"Inscription of the Pathway," for which see volume viii. of this
edition.&mdash;Ed.</span><br>

<a name="22n1"></a><i><b>Note:</b></i> &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;">This poem underwent no change in successive editions. The title in all
the earlier ones (1815 to 1843) was <i>The Cottager to her Infant. By a
Female Friend</i>; and in the preface to the edition of 1815, Wordsworth
wrote,</span>

 <blockquote> "Three short pieces (now first published) are the work of a Female
  Friend; ... if any one regard them with dislike, or be disposed to
  condemn them, let the censure fall upon him, who, trusting in his own
  sense of their merit, and their fitness for the place which they
  occupy, <i>extorted</i> them from the Authoress."</blockquote>

In the edition of 1845, he disclosed the authorship; and gave the more
natural title, <i>By my Sister</i>. Other two poems by her were introduced
into the edition of 1815, and subsequent ones, viz. the <i>Address to a
Child</i>, and <i>The Mother's Return</i>. In an appendix to a MS. copy of the
<i>Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland</i>, by Dorothy Wordsworth,
transcribed by Mrs. Clarkson, I find the poem 'The Cottager to her
Infant' with two additional stanzas, which are there attributed to
Wordsworth. The appendix runs thus:

  <blockquote>"To my Niece Dorothy, a sleepless Baby<br>
<br>
    <b>The Cottager to Her Infant</b><br>
<br>
  (The third and fourth stanzas which follow by W. W.)

   <blockquote> 'Ah! if I were a lady gay<br>
    I should not grieve with thee to play;<br>
    Right gladly would I lie awake<br>
    Thy lively spirits to partake,<br>
      And ask no better cheer.<br>
    <br>
    But, Babe! there's none to work for me.<br>
    And I must rise to industry;<br>
    Soon as the cock begins to crow<br>
    Thy mother to the fold must go<br>
      To tend the sheep and kine.'"</blockquote></blockquote>

<b>To Charles Lamb, Esq.<br>
<br>
My Dear Friend,</b><br>
<br>
When I sent you, a few weeks ago, the Tale of <i>Peter Bell</i>, you asked
"why <b>The Waggoner</b> was not added?"&mdash;To say the truth,&mdash;from the higher
tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the
former, I apprehended, this little Piece could not accompany it without
disadvantage. In the year 1806, if I am not mistaken, <b>The Waggoner</b> was
read to you in manuscript; and, as you have remembered it for so long a
time, I am the more encouraged to hope, that, since the localities on
which it partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you, it

<td>'Tis spent&mdash;this burning day of June!<br>
Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing;<br>
The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round, is wheeling,&mdash;<br>
That solitary bird<br>
Is all that can be heard    <br>
In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon!<br><br>

  Confiding Glow-worms, 'tis a night<br>
Propitious to your earth-born light!<br>
But, where the scattered stars are seen<br>
In hazy straits the clouds between,    <br>
Each, in his station twinkling not,<br>
Seems changed into a pallid spot.<br>
The mountains against heaven's grave weight<br>
Rise up, and grow to wondrous height.<br>
The air, as in a lion's den,    <br>
Is close and hot;&mdash;and now and then<br>
Comes a tired and sultry breeze<br>
With a haunting and a panting,<br>
Like the stifling of disease;<br>
But the dews allay the heat,    <br>
And the silence makes it sweet.<br><br>

  Hush, there is some one on the stir!<br>
'Tis Benjamin the Waggoner;<br>
Who long hath trod this toilsome way,<br>
Companion of the night and day.    <br>
That far-off tinkling's drowsy cheer,<br>
Mix'd with a faint yet grating sound<br>
In a moment lost and found,<br>
The Wain announces&mdash;by whose side<br>
Along the banks of Rydal Mere      <br>
He paces on, a trusty Guide,&mdash;<br>
Listen! you can scarcely hear!<br>
Hither he his course is bending;&mdash;<br>
Now he leaves the lower ground,<br>
And up the craggy hill ascending       <br>
Many a stop and stay he makes,<br>
Many a breathing-fit he takes;&mdash;<br>
Steep the way and wearisome,<br>
Yet all the while his whip is dumb!       <br><br>

  The Horses have worked with right good-will,<br>
And so have gained the top of the hill;<br>
He was patient, they were strong,<br>
And now they smoothly glide along,<br>
Recovering breath, and pleased to win<br>
The praises of mild Benjamin.       <br>
Heaven shield him from mishap and snare!<br>
But why so early with this prayer?<br>
Is it for threatenings in the sky?<br>
Or for some other danger nigh?<br>
No; none is near him yet, though he      <br>
Be one of much infirmity;<br>
For at the bottom of the brow,<br>
Where once the <b>Dove</b> and <b>Olive-bough</b><br>
Offered a greeting of good ale<br>
To all who entered Grasmere Vale;          <br>
And called on him who must depart<br>
To leave it with a jovial heart;<br>
There, where the <b>Dove</b> and <b>Olive-bough</b><br>
Once hung, a Poet harbours now,<br>
A simple water-drinking Bard;                <br>
Why need our Hero then (though frail<br>
His best resolves) be on his guard?<br>
He marches by, secure and bold;<br>
Yet while he thinks on times of old,<br>
It seems that all looks wondrous cold;            <br>
He shrugs his shoulders, shakes his head,<br>
And, for the honest folk within,<br>
It is a doubt with Benjamin<br>
Whether they be alive or dead!<br><br>

  <i>Here</i> is no danger,&mdash;none at all!         <br>
Beyond his wish he walks secure;<br>
But pass a mile&mdash;and <i>then</i> for trial,&mdash;<br>
Then for the pride of self-denial;<br>
If he resist that tempting door,<br>
Which with such friendly voice will call;        <br>
If he resist those casement panes,<br>
And that bright gleam which thence will fall<br>
Upon his Leaders' bells and manes,<br>
Inviting him with cheerful lure:<br>
For still, though all be dark elsewhere,           <br>
Some shining notice will be <i>there</i><br>
Of open house and ready fare.<br><br>

  The place to Benjamin right well<br>
Is known, and by as strong a spell<br>
As used to be that sign of love           <br>
And hope&mdash;the <b>Olive-bough</b> and <b>Dove</b>;<br>
He knows it to his cost, good Man!<br>
Who does not know the famous <b>Swan</b>?<br>
Object uncouth! and yet our boast,<br>
For it was painted by the Host;     <br>
His own conceit the figure planned,<br>
'Twas coloured all by his own hand;<br>
And that frail Child of thirsty clay,<br>
Of whom I sing this rustic lay,<br>
Could tell with self-dissatisfaction     <br>
Quaint stories of the bird's attraction!<br><br>

  Well! that is past&mdash;and in despite<br>
Of open door and shining light.<br>
And now the conqueror essays<br>
The long ascent of Dunmail-raise;     <br>
And with his team is gentle here<br>
As when he clomb from Rydal Mere;<br>
His whip they do not dread&mdash;his voice<br>
They only hear it to rejoice.<br>
To stand or go is at <i>their</i> pleasure;     <br>
Their efforts and their time they measure<br>
By generous pride within the breast;<br>
And, while they strain, and while they rest,<br>
He thus pursues his thoughts at leisure.<br><br>

  Now am I fairly safe to-night&mdash;           <br>
And with proud cause my heart is light:<br>
I trespassed lately worse than ever&mdash;<br>
But Heaven has blest a good endeavour;<br>
And, to my soul's content, I find<br>
The evil One is left behind.                <br>
Yes, let my master fume and fret,<br>
Here am I&mdash;with my horses yet!<br>
My jolly team, he finds that ye<br>
Will work for nobody but me!<br>
Full proof of this the Country gained;       <br>
It knows how ye were vexed and strained,<br>
And forced unworthy stripes to bear,<br>
When trusted to another's care.<br>
Here was it&mdash;on this rugged slope,<br>
Which now ye climb with heart and hope,       <br>
I saw you, between rage and fear,<br>
Plunge, and fling back a spiteful ear,<br>
And ever more and more confused,<br>
As ye were more and more abused:<br>
As chance would have it, passing by            <br>
I saw you in that jeopardy:<br>
A word from me was like a charm;<br>
Ye pulled together with one mind;<br>
And your huge burthen, safe from harm,<br>
Moved like a vessel in the wind!    <br>
&mdash;Yes, without me, up hills so high<br>
'Tis vain to strive for mastery.<br>
Then grieve not, jolly team! though tough<br>
The road we travel, steep, and rough;<br>
Though Rydal-heights and Dunmail-raise, <br>
And all their fellow banks and braes,<br>
Full often make you stretch and strain,<br>
And halt for breath and halt again,<br>
Yet to their sturdiness 'tis owing<br>
That side by side we still are going! <br><br>

  While Benjamin in earnest mood<br>
His meditations thus pursued,<br>
A storm, which had been smothered long,<br>
Was growing inwardly more strong;<br>
And, in its struggles to get free, <br>
Was busily employed as he.<br>
The thunder had begun to growl&mdash;<br>
He heard not, too intent of soul;<br>
The air was now without a breath&mdash;<br>
He marked not that 'twas still as death. <br>
But soon large rain-drops on his head<br>
Fell with the weight of drops of lead;&mdash;<br>
He starts&mdash;and takes, at the admonition,<br>
A sage survey of his condition.<br>
The road is black before his eyes,<br>
Glimmering faintly where it lies;<br>
Black is the sky&mdash;and every hill,<br>
Up to the sky, is blacker still&mdash;<br>
Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room,<br>
Hung round and overhung with gloom;      <br>
Save that above a single height<br>
Is to be seen a lurid light,<br>
Above Helm-crag&mdash;a streak half dead,<br>
A burning of portentous red;<br>
And near that lurid light, full well     <br>
The <b>Astrologer</b>, sage Sidrophel,<br>
Where at his desk and book he sits,<br>
Puzzling aloft his curious wits;<br>
He whose domain is held in common<br>
With no one but the <b>Ancient Woman</b>,      <br>
Cowering beside her rifted cell,<br>
As if intent on magic spell;-<br>
Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,<br>
Still sit upon Helm-crag together!<br><br>

  The <b>Astrologer</b> was not unseen        <br>
By solitary Benjamin;<br>
But total darkness came anon,<br>
And he and every thing was gone:<br>
And suddenly a ruffling breeze,<br>
(That would have rocked the sounding trees      <br>
Had aught of sylvan growth been there)<br>
Swept through the Hollow long and bare:<br>
The rain rushed down&mdash;the road was battered,<br>
As with the force of billows shattered;<br>
The horses are dismayed, nor know        <br>
Whether they should stand or go;<br>
And Benjamin is groping near them,<br>
Sees nothing, and can scarcely hear them.<br>
He is astounded,&mdash;wonder not,&mdash;<br>
With such a charge in such a spot;       <br>
Astounded in the mountain gap<br>
With thunder-peals, clap after clap,<br>
Close-treading on the silent flashes&mdash;<br>
And somewhere, as he thinks, by crashes<br>
Among the rocks; with weight of rain,       <br>
And sullen motions long and slow,<br>
That to a dreary distance go&mdash;<br>
Till, breaking in upon the dying strain,<br>
A rending o'er his head begins the fray again.<br><br>

  Meanwhile, uncertain what to do,     <br>
And oftentimes compelled to halt,<br>
The horses cautiously pursue<br>
Their way, without mishap or fault;<br>
And now have reached that pile of stones,<br>
Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;      <br>
He who had once supreme command,<br>
Last king of rocky Cumberland;<br>
His bones, and those of all his Power,<br>
Slain here in a disastrous hour!<br><br>

  When, passing through this narrow strait,         <br>
Stony, and dark, and desolate,<br>
Benjamin can faintly hear<br>
A voice that comes from some one near,<br>
A female voice:&mdash;"Whoe'er you be,<br>
Stop," it exclaimed, "and pity me!"        <br>
And, less in pity than in wonder,<br>
Amid the darkness and the thunder,<br>
The Waggoner, with prompt command,<br>
Summons his horses to a stand.<br><br>

  While, with increasing agitation,            <br>
The Woman urged her supplication,<br>
In rueful words, with sobs between&mdash;<br>
The voice of tears that fell unseen;<br>
There came a flash&mdash;a startling glare,<br>
And all Seat-Sandal was laid bare!            <br>
'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,<br>
And Benjamin, without a question,<br>
Taking her for some way-worn rover,<br>
Said, "Mount, and get you under cover!"<br>
Another voice, in tone as hoarse           <br>
As a swoln brook with rugged course,<br>
Cried out, "Good brother, why so fast?<br>
I've had a glimpse of you&mdash;'avast!'<br>
Or, since it suits you to be civil,<br>
Take her at once&mdash;for good and evil!"           <br><br>

"It is my Husband," softly said<br>
The Woman, as if half afraid:<br>
By this time she was snug within,<br>
Through help of honest Benjamin;<br>
She and her Babe, which to her breast           <br>
With thankfulness the Mother pressed;<br>
And now the same strong voice more near<br>
Said cordially, "My Friend, what cheer?<br>
Rough doings these! as God's my judge,<br>
The sky owes somebody a grudge!            <br>
We've had in half an hour or less<br>
A twelvemonth's terror and distress!"<br><br>

Then Benjamin entreats the Man<br>
Would mount, too, quickly as he can:<br>
The Sailor&mdash;Sailor now no more,           <br>
But such he had been heretofore&mdash;<br>
To courteous Benjamin replied,<br>
"Go you your way, and mind not me;<br>
For I must have, whate'er betide,<br>
My Ass and fifty things beside,&mdash;           <br>
Go, and I'll follow speedily!"<br><br>

The Waggon moves&mdash;and with its load<br>
Descends along the sloping road;<br>
And the rough Sailor instantly<br>
Turns to a little tent hard by:           <br>
For when, at closing-in of day,<br>
The family had come that way,<br>
Green pasture and the soft warm air<br>
Tempted them to settle there.&mdash;<br>
Green is the grass for beast to graze,      <br>
Around the stones of Dunmail-raise!<br><br>

The Sailor gathers up his bed,<br>
Takes down the canvass overhead;<br>
And, after farewell to the place,<br>
A parting word&mdash;though not of grace,      <br>
Pursues, with Ass and all his store,<br>
The way the Waggon went before.</td>

<td>If Wytheburn's modest House of prayer,<br>
As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,<br>
Had, with its belfry's humble stock,      <br>
A little pair that hang in air,<br>
Been mistress also of a clock,<br>
(And one, too, not in crazy plight)<br>
Twelve strokes that clock would have been telling<br>
Under the brow of old Helvellyn&mdash;      <br>
Its bead-roll of midnight,<br>
Then, when the Hero of my tale<br>
Was passing by, and, down the vale<br>
(The vale now silent, hushed I ween<br>
As if a storm had never been)     <br>
Proceeding with a mind at ease;<br>
While the old Familiar of the seas<br>
Intent to use his utmost haste,<br>
Gained ground upon the Waggon fast,<br>
And gives another lusty cheer;     <br>
For spite of rumbling of the wheels,<br>
A welcome greeting he can hear;&mdash;<br>
It is a fiddle in its glee<br>
Dinning from the <b>Cherry Tree</b>!<br><br>

Thence the sound&mdash;the light is there&mdash;     <br>
As Benjamin is now aware,<br>
Who, to his inward thoughts confined,<br>
Had almost reached the festive door,<br>
When, startled by the Sailor's roar,<br>
He hears a sound and sees the light,      <br>
And in a moment calls to mind<br>
That 'tis the village <b>Merry-Night</b>!<br><br>

Although before in no dejection,<br>
At this insidious recollection<br>
His heart with sudden joy is filled,&mdash;     <br>
His ears are by the music thrilled,<br>
His eyes take pleasure in the road<br>
Glittering before him bright and broad;<br>
And Benjamin is wet and cold,<br>
And there are reasons manifold            <br>
That make the good, tow'rds which he's yearning,<br>
Look fairly like a lawful earning.<br><br>

  Nor has thought time to come and go,<br>
To vibrate between yes and no;<br>
For, cries the Sailor, "Glorious chance     <br>
That blew us hither!&mdash;let him dance,<br>
Who can or will!&mdash;my honest soul,<br>
Our treat shall be a friendly bowl!"<br>
He draws him to the door&mdash;"Come in,<br>
Come, come," cries he to Benjamin!          <br>
And Benjamin&mdash;ah, woe is me!<br>
Gave the word&mdash;the horses heard<br>
And halted, though reluctantly.<br><br>

  "Blithe souls and lightsome hearts have we,<br>
Feasting at the <b>Cherry Tree</b>!"              <br>
This was the outside proclamation,<br>
This was the inside salutation;<br>
What bustling&mdash;jostling&mdash;high and low!<br>
A universal overflow!<br>
What tankards foaming from the tap!        <br>
What store of cakes in every lap!<br>
What thumping&mdash;stumping&mdash;overhead!<br>
The thunder had not been more busy:<br>
With such a stir you would have said,<br>
This little place may well be dizzy! <br>
'Tis who can dance with greatest vigour&mdash;<br>
'Tis what can be most prompt and eager;<br>
As if it heard the fiddle's call,<br>
The pewter clatters on the wall;<br>
The very bacon shows its feeling,      <br>
Swinging from the smoky ceiling!<br><br>

  A steaming bowl, a blazing fire,<br>
What greater good can heart desire?<br>
'Twere worth a wise man's while to try<br>
The utmost anger of the sky:               <br>
To <i>seek</i> for thoughts of a gloomy cast,<br>
If such the bright amends at last.<br>
Now should you say I judge amiss,<br>
The <b>Cherry Tree</b> shows proof of this;<br>
For soon of all the happy there,        <br>
Our Travellers are the happiest pair;<br>
All care with Benjamin is gone&mdash;<br>
A C&aelig;sar past the Rubicon!<br>
He thinks not of his long, long strife;&mdash;<br>
The Sailor, Man by nature gay,             <br>
Hath no resolves to throw away;<br>
And he hath now forgot his Wife,<br>
Hath quite forgotten her&mdash;or may be<br>
Thinks her the luckiest soul on earth,<br>
Within that warm and peaceful berth,       <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under cover,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terror over,<br>
Sleeping by her sleeping Baby.<br><br>

  With bowl that sped from hand to hand,<br>
The gladdest of the gladsome band,       <br>
Amid their own delight and fun,<br>
They hear&mdash;when every dance is done,<br>
When every whirling bout is o'er&mdash;<br>
The fiddle's <i>squeak</i>&mdash;that call to bliss,<br>
Ever followed by a kiss;       <br>
They envy not the happy lot,<br>
But enjoy their own the more!<br><br>

  While thus our jocund Travellers fare,<br>
Up springs the Sailor from his chair&mdash;<br>
Limps (for I might have told before       <br>
That he was lame) across the floor&mdash;<br>
Is gone&mdash;returns&mdash;and with a prize;<br>
With what?&mdash;a Ship of lusty size;<br>
A gallant stately Man-of-war,<br>
Fixed on a smoothly-sliding car.       <br>
Surprise to all, but most surprise<br>
To Benjamin, who rubs his eyes,<br>
Not knowing that he had befriended<br>
A Man so gloriously attended!       <br><br>

  "This," cries the Sailor, "a Third-rate is&mdash;<br>
Stand back, and you shall see her gratis!<br>
This was the Flag-ship at the Nile,<br>
The Vanguard&mdash;you may smirk and smile,<br>
But, pretty Maid, if you look near,<br>
You'll find you've much in little here!       <br>
A nobler ship did never swim,<br>
And you shall see her in full trim:<br>
I'll set, my friends, to do you honour,<br>
Set every inch of sail upon her."<br>
So said, so done; and masts, sails, yards,       <br>
He names them all; and interlards<br>
His speech with uncouth terms of art,<br>
Accomplished in the showman's part;<br>
And then, as from a sudden check,<br>
Cries out&mdash;"'Tis there, the quarter-deck       <br>
On which brave Admiral Nelson stood&mdash;<br>
A sight that would have roused your blood!<br>
One eye he had, which, bright as ten,<br>
Burned like a fire among his men;<br>
Let this be land, and that be sea,       <br>
Here lay the French&mdash;and <i>thus</i> came we!"<br><br>

  Hushed was by this the fiddle's sound,<br>
The dancers all were gathered round,<br>
And, such the stillness of the house,<br>
You might have heard a nibbling mouse;       <br>
While, borrowing helps where'er he may,<br>
The Sailor through the story runs<br>
Of ships to ships and guns to guns;<br>
And does his utmost to display<br>
The dismal conflict, and the might       <br>
And terror of that marvellous night!<br>
"A bowl, a bowl of double measure,"<br>
Cries Benjamin, "a draught of length,<br>
To Nelson, England's pride and treasure,<br>
Her bulwark and her tower of strength!"      <br>
When Benjamin had seized the bowl,<br>
The mastiff, from beneath the waggon,<br>
Where he lay, watchful as a dragon,<br>
Rattled his chain;&mdash;'twas all in vain,<br>
For Benjamin, triumphant soul!<br>
He heard the monitory growl;<br>
Heard&mdash;and in opposition quaffed<br>
A deep, determined, desperate draught!<br>
Nor did the battered Tar forget,<br>
Or flinch from what he deemed his debt:      <br>
Then, like a hero crowned with laurel,<br>
Back to her place the ship he led;<br>
Wheeled her back in full apparel;<br>
And so, flag flying at mast head,<br>
Re-yoked her to the Ass:&mdash;anon,             <br>
Cries Benjamin, "We must be gone."<br>
Thus, after two hours' hearty stay,<br>
Again behold them on their way!</td>

<td>Right gladly had the horses stirred,<br>
When they the wished-for greeting heard,<br>
The whip's loud notice from the door,<br>
That they were free to move once more.<br>
You think, those doings must have bred<br>
In them disheartening doubts and dread;<br>
No, not a horse of all the eight,<br>
Although it be a moonless night,<br>
Fears either for himself or freight;<br>
For this they know (and let it hide,<br>
In part, the offences of their guide)<br>
That Benjamin, with clouded brains,<br>
Is worth the best with all their pains;<br>
And, if they had a prayer to make,<br>
The prayer would be that they may take<br>
With him whatever comes in course,<br>
The better fortune or the worse;<br>
That no one else may have business near them,<br>
And, drunk or sober, he may steer them.<br><br>

  So, forth in dauntless mood they fare,<br>
And with them goes the guardian pair.<br><br>

  Now, heroes, for the true commotion,<br>
The triumph of your late devotion!<br>
Can aught on earth impede delight,<br>
Still mounting to a higher height;<br>
And higher still&mdash;a greedy flight!<br>
Can any low-born care pursue her,<br>
Can any mortal clog come to her?<br>
No notion have they&mdash;not a thought,<br>
That is from joyless regions brought!<br>
And, while they coast the silent lake,<br>
Their inspiration I partake;<br>
Share their empyreal spirits&mdash;yea,<br>
With their enraptured vision, see&mdash;<br>
O fancy&mdash;what a jubilee!<br>
What shifting pictures&mdash;clad in gleams<br>
Of colour bright as feverish dreams!<br>
Earth, spangled sky, and lake serene,<br>
Involved and restless all&mdash;a scene<br>
Pregnant with mutual exaltation,<br>
Rich change, and multiplied creation!<br>
This sight to me the Muse imparts;&mdash;<br>
And then, what kindness in their hearts!<br>
What tears of rapture, what vow-making,<br>
Profound entreaties, and hand-shaking!<br>
What solemn, vacant, interlacing,<br>
As if they'd fall asleep embracing!<br>
Then, in the turbulence of glee,<br>
And in the excess of amity,<br>
Says Benjamin, "That Ass of thine,<br>
He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine:<br>
If he were tethered to the waggon,<br>
He'd drag as well what he is dragging;<br>
And we, as brother should with brother,<br>
Might trudge it alongside each other!"<br><br>

  Forthwith, obedient to command,<br>
The horses made a quiet stand;<br>
And to the waggon's skirts was tied<br>
The Creature, by the Mastiff's side,<br>
The Mastiff wondering, and perplext<br>
With dread of what will happen next;<br>
And thinking it but sorry cheer,<br>
To have such company so near!<br><br>

  This new arrangement made, the Wain<br>
Through the still night proceeds again;<br>
No Moon hath risen her light to lend;<br>
But indistinctly may be kenned<br>
The <b>Vanguard</b>, following close behind,<br>
Sails spread, as if to catch the wind!<br><br>

  "Thy wife and child are snug and warm,<br>
Thy ship will travel without harm;<br>
I like," said Benjamin, "her shape and stature:<br>
And this of mine&mdash;this bulky creature<br>
Of which I have the steering&mdash;this,<br>
Seen fairly, is not much amiss!<br>
We want your streamers, friend, you know;<br>
But, altogether as we go,<br>
We make a kind of handsome show!<br>
Among these hills, from first to last,<br>
We've weathered many a furious blast;<br>
Hard passage forcing on, with head<br>
Against the storm, and canvass spread.<br>
I hate a boaster; but to thee<br>
Will say't, who know'st both land and sea,<br>
The unluckiest hulk that stems the brine<br>
Is hardly worse beset than mine,<br>
When cross-winds on her quarter beat;<br>
And, fairly lifted from my feet,<br>
I stagger onward&mdash;heaven knows how;<br>
But not so pleasantly as now:<br>
Poor pilot I, by snows confounded,<br>
And many a foundrous pit surrounded!<br>
Yet here we are, by night and day<br>
Grinding through rough and smooth our way;<br>
Through foul and fair our task fulfilling;<br>
And long shall be so yet&mdash;God willing!"<br><br>

  "Ay," said the Tar, "through fair and foul&mdash;<br>
But save us from yon screeching owl!"<br>
That instant was begun a fray<br>
Which called their thoughts another way:<br>
The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl!<br>
What must he do but growl and snarl,<br>
Still more and more dissatisfied<br>
With the meek comrade at his side!<br>
Till, not incensed though put to proof,<br>
The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof,<br>
Salutes the Mastiff on the head;<br>
And so were better manners bred,<br>
And all was calmed and quieted.<br><br>

  "Yon screech-owl," says the Sailor, turning<br>
Back to his former cause of mourning,<br>
"Yon owl!&mdash;pray God that all be well!<br>
'Tis worse than any funeral bell;<br>
As sure as I've the gift of sight,<br>
We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!"<br>
&mdash;Said Benjamin, "This whip shall lay<br>
A thousand, if they cross our way.<br>
I know that Wanton's noisy station,<br>
I know him and his occupation;<br>
The jolly bird hath learned his cheer<br>
Upon the banks of Windermere;<br>
Where a tribe of them make merry,<br>
Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry;<br>
Hallooing from an open throat,<br>
Like travellers shouting for a boat.<br>
&mdash;The tricks he learned at Windermere<br>
This vagrant owl is playing here&mdash;<br>
That is the worst of his employment:<br>
He's at the top of his enjoyment!"<br><br>

  This explanation stilled the alarm,<br>
Cured the foreboder like a charm;<br>
This, and the manner, and the voice,<br>
Summoned the Sailor to rejoice;<br>
His heart is up&mdash;he fears no evil<br>
From life or death, from man or devil;<br>
He wheels&mdash;and, making many stops,<br>
Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops;<br>
And, while he talked of blows and scars,<br>
Benjamin, among the stars,<br>
Beheld a dancing&mdash;and a glancing;<br>
Such retreating and advancing<br>
As, I ween, was never seen<br>
In bloodiest battle since the days of Mars!</td>

<td>Thus they, with freaks of proud delight,<br>
Beguile the remnant of the night;<br>
And many a snatch of jovial song<br>
Regales them as they wind along;<br>
While to the music, from on high,<br>
The echoes make a glad reply.&mdash;<br>
But the sage Muse the revel heeds<br>
No farther than her story needs;<br>
Nor will she servilely attend<br>
The loitering journey to its end.<br>
&mdash;Blithe spirits of her own impel<br>
The Muse, who scents the morning air,<br>
To take of this transported pair<br>
A brief and unreproved farewell;<br>
To quit the slow-paced waggon's side,<br>
And wander down yon hawthorn dell,<br>
With murmuring Greta for her guide.<br>
&mdash;There doth she ken the awful form<br>
Of Raven-crag&mdash;black as a storm&mdash;<br>
Glimmering through the twilight pale;<br>
And Ghimmer-crag, his tall twin brother,<br>
Each peering forth to meet the other:&mdash;<br>
And, while she roves through St. John's Vale,<br>
Along the smooth unpathwayed plain,<br>
By sheep-track or through cottage lane,<br>
Where no disturbance comes to intrude<br>
Upon the pensive solitude,<br>
Her unsuspecting eye, perchance,<br>
With the rude shepherd's favoured glance,<br>
Beholds the faeries in array,<br>
Whose party-coloured garments gay<br>
The silent company betray:<br>
Red, green, and blue; a moment's sight!<br>
For Skiddaw-top with rosy light<br>
Is touched&mdash;and all the band take flight.<br>
&mdash;Fly also, Muse! and from the dell<br>
Mount to the ridge of Nathdale Fell;<br>
Thence, look thou forth o'er wood and lawn<br>
Hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn;<br>
Across yon meadowy bottom look,<br>
Where close fogs hide their parent brook;<br>
And see, beyond that hamlet small,<br>
The ruined towers of Threlkeld-hall,<br>
Lurking in a double shade,<br>
By trees and lingering twilight made!<br>
There, at Blencathara's rugged feet,<br>
Sir Lancelot gave a safe retreat<br>
To noble Clifford; from annoy<br>
Concealed the persecuted boy,<br>
Well pleased in rustic garb to feed<br>
His flock, and pipe on shepherd's reed<br>
Among this multitude of hills,<br>
Crags, woodlands, waterfalls, and rills;<br>
Which soon the morning shall enfold,<br>
From east to west, in ample vest<br>
Of massy gloom and radiance bold.<br><br>

  The mists, that o'er the streamlet's bed<br>
Hung low, begin to rise and spread;<br>
Even while I speak, their skirts of grey<br>
Are smitten by a silver ray;<br>
And lo!&mdash;up Castrigg's naked steep<br>
(Where, smoothly urged, the vapours sweep<br>
Along&mdash;and scatter and divide,<br>
Like fleecy clouds self-multiplied)<br>
The stately waggon is ascending,<br>
With faithful Benjamin attending,<br>
Apparent now beside his team&mdash;<br>
Now lost amid a glittering steam:<br>
And with him goes his Sailor-friend,<br>
By this time near their journey's end;<br>
And, after their high-minded riot,<br>
Sickening into thoughtful quiet;<br>
As if the morning's pleasant hour,<br>
Had for their joys a killing power.<br>
And, sooth, for Benjamin a vein<br>
Is opened of still deeper pain,<br>
As if his heart by notes were stung<br>
From out the lowly hedge-rows flung;<br>
As if the warbler lost in light<br>
Reproved his soarings of the night,<br>
In strains of rapture pure and holy<br>
Upbraided his distempered folly.<br><br>

  Drooping is he, his step is dull;<br>
But the horses stretch and pull;<br>
With increasing vigour climb,<br>
Eager to repair lost time;<br>
Whether, by their own desert,<br>
Knowing what cause there is for shame,<br>
They are labouring to avert<br>
As much as may be of the blame,<br>
Which, they foresee, must soon alight<br>
Upon <i>his</i> head, whom, in despite<br>
Of all his failings, they love best;<br>
Whether for him they are distrest,<br>
Or, by length of fasting roused,<br>
Are impatient to be housed:<br>
Up against the hill they strain<br>
Tugging at the iron chain,<br>
Tugging all with might and main,<br>
Last and foremost, every horse<br>
To the utmost of his force!<br>
And the smoke and respiration,<br>
Rising like an exhalation,<br>
Blend with the mist&mdash;a moving shroud<br>
To form, an undissolving cloud;<br>
Which, with slant ray, the merry sun<br>
Takes delight to play upon.<br>
Never golden-haired Apollo,<br>
Pleased some favourite chief to follow<br>
Through accidents of peace or war,<br>
In a perilous moment threw<br>
Around the object of his care<br>
Veil of such celestial hue;<br>
Interposed so bright a screen&mdash;<br>
Him and his enemies between!<br><br>

  Alas! what boots it?&mdash;who can hide,<br>
When the malicious Fates are bent<br>
On working out an ill intent?<br>
Can destiny be turned aside?<br>
No&mdash;sad progress of my story!<br>
Benjamin, this outward glory<br>
Cannot shield thee from thy Master,<br>
Who from Keswick has pricked forth,<br>
Sour and surly as the north;<br>
And, in fear of some disaster,<br>
Comes to give what help he may,<br>
And to hear what thou canst say;<br>
If, as needs he must forebode,<br>
Thou hast been loitering on the road!<br>
His fears, his doubts, may now take flight&mdash;<br>
The wishcd-for object is in sight;<br>
Yet, trust the Muse, it rather hath<br>
Stirred him up to livelier wrath;<br>
Which he stifles, moody man!<br>
With all the patience that he can;<br>
To the end that, at your meeting,<br>
He may give thee decent greeting.<br><br>

  There he is&mdash;resolved to stop,<br>
Till the waggon gains the top;<br>
But stop he cannot&mdash;must advance:<br>
Him Benjamin, with lucky glance,<br>
Espies&mdash;and instantly is ready,<br>
Self-collected, poised, and steady:<br>
And, to be the better seen,<br>
Issues from his radiant shroud,<br>
From his close-attending cloud,<br>
With careless air and open mien.<br>
Erect his port, and firm his going;<br>
So struts yon cock that now is crowing;<br>
And the morning light in grace<br>
Strikes upon his lifted face,<br>
Hurrying the pallid hue away<br>
That might his trespasses betray.<br>
But what can all avail to clear him,<br>
Or what need of explanation,<br>
Parley or interrogation?<br>
For the Master sees, alas!<br>
That unhappy Figure near him,<br>
Limping o'er the dewy grass,<br>
Where the road it fringes, sweet,<br>
Soft and cool to way-worn feet;<br>
And, O indignity! an Ass,<br>
By his noble Mastiffs side,<br>
Tethered to the waggon's tail:<br>
And the ship, in all her pride,<br>
Following after in full sail!<br>
Not to speak of babe and mother;<br>
Who, contented with each other,<br>
And snug as birds in leafy arbour,<br>
Find, within, a blessed harbour!<br><br>

  With eager eyes the Master pries;<br>
Looks in and out, and through and through;<br>
Says nothing&mdash;till at last he spies<br>
A wound upon the Mastiff's head,<br>
A wound, where plainly might be read<br>
What feats an Ass's hoof can do!<br>
But drop the rest:&mdash;this aggravation,<br>
This complicated provocation,<br>
A hoard of grievances unsealed;<br>
All past forgiveness it repealed;<br>
And thus, and through distempered blood<br>
On both sides, Benjamin the good,<br>
The patient, and the tender-hearted,<br>
Was from his team and waggon parted;<br>
When duty of that day was o'er,<br>
Laid down his whip&mdash;and served no more.&mdash;<br>
Nor could the waggon long survive,<br>
Which Benjamin had ceased to drive:<br>
It lingered on;&mdash;guide after guide<br>
Ambitiously the office tried;<br>
But each unmanageable hill<br>
Called for <i>his</i> patience and <i>his</i> skill;&mdash;<br>
And sure it is, that through this night,<br>
And what the morning brought to light,<br>
Two losses had we to sustain,<br>
We lost both <b>Waggoner</b> and <b>Wain</b>!<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align="left"><br>
<br>

Accept, O Friend, for praise or blame,<br>
The gift of this adventurous song;<br>
A record which I dared to frame,<br>
Though timid scruples checked me long;<br>
They checked me&mdash;and I left the theme<br>
Untouched;&mdash;in spite of many a gleam<br>
Of fancy which thereon was shed,<br>
Like pleasant sunbeams shifting still<br>
Upon the side of a distant hill:<br>
But Nature might not be gainsaid;<br>
For what I have and what I miss<br>
I sing of these;&mdash;it makes my bliss!<br>
Nor is it I who play the part,<br>
But a shy spirit in my heart,<br>
That comes and goes&mdash;will sometimes leap<br>
From hiding-places ten years deep;<br>
Or haunts me with familiar face,<br>
Returning, like a ghost unlaid,<br>
Until the debt I owe be paid.<br>
Forgive me, then; for I had been<br>
On friendly terms with this Machine:<br>
In him, while he was wont to trace<br>
Our roads, through many a long year's space,<br>
A living almanack had we;<br>
We had a speaking diary,<br>
That in this uneventful place,<br>
Gave to the days a mark and name<br>
By which we knew them when they came.<br>
&mdash;Yes, I, and all about me here,<br>
Through all the changes of the year,<br>
Had seen him through the mountains go,<br>
In pomp of mist or pomp of snow,<br>
Majestically huge and slow:<br>
Or, with a milder grace adorning<br>
The landscape of a summer's morning;<br>
While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain<br>
The moving image to detain;<br>
And mighty Fairfield, with a chime<br>
Of echoes, to his march kept time;<br>
When little other business stirred,<br>
And little other sound was heard;<br>
In that delicious hour of balm,<br>
Stillness, solitude, and calm,<br>
While yet the valley is arrayed,<br>
On this side with a sober shade;<br>
On that is prodigally bright&mdash;<br>
Crag, lawn, and wood&mdash;with rosy light.<br>
&mdash;But most of all, thou lordly Wain!<br>
I wish to have thee here again,<br>
When windows flap and chimney roars,<br>
And all is dismal out of doors;<br>
And, sitting by my fire, I see<br>
Eight sorry carts, no less a train!<br>
Unworthy successors of thee,<br>
Come straggling through the wind and rain:<br>
And oft, as they pass slowly on,<br>
Beneath my windows, one by one,<br>
See, perched upon the naked height<br>
The summit of a cumbrous freight,<br>
A single traveller&mdash;and there<br>
Another; then perhaps a pair&mdash;<br>
The lame, the sickly, and the old;<br>
Men, women, heartless with the cold;<br>
And babes in wet and starveling plight;<br>
Which once, be weather as it might,<br>
Had still a nest within a nest,<br>
Thy shelter&mdash;and their mother's breast!<br>
Then most of all, then far the most,<br>
Do I regret what we have lost;<br>
Am grieved for that unhappy sin<br>
Which robbed us of good Benjamin;&mdash;<br>
And of his stately Charge, which none<br>
Could keep alive when He was gone!<br>

either him or his waggon, he said:&mdash;"They could not do without me; and

  He knows his ground, and hopes to find<br>

<a name="23n4"></a><i>Editor's Note:</i> &nbsp; There is no poem more closely identified with the Grasmere district of
the English Lakes&mdash;and with the road from Grasmere to Keswick&mdash;than <i>The
Waggoner</i> is, and in none are the topographical allusions more minute
and faithful.<br>
<br>
Wordsworth seemed at a loss to know in what "class" of his poems to
place <i>The Waggoner;</i> and his frequent changes&mdash;removing it from one
group to another&mdash;shew the artificial character of these classes. Thus,
in the edition of 1820, it stood first among the "Poems of the Fancy."
In 1827 it was the last of the "Poems founded on the Affections." In
1832 it was reinstated among the "Poems of the Fancy." In 1836 it had a
place of its own, and was inserted between the "Poems of the Fancy" and
those "Founded on the Affections;" while in 1845 it was sent back to its
original place among the "Poems of the Fancy;" although in the table of
contents it was printed as an independent poem, closing the series.<br>
<br>
The original text of <i>The Waggoner</i> underwent little change, till the
year 1836, when it was carefully revised, and altered throughout. The
final edition of 1845, however, reverted, in many instances&mdash;especially
in the first canto&mdash;to the original text of 1819.<br>
<br>
As this poem was dedicated to Charles Lamb, it may be of interest to
note that, some six months afterwards, Lamb presented Wordsworth with a
copy of the first edition of 'Paradise Regained' (the edition of 1671),
writing on it the following sentence, 

 <blockquote> "Charles Lamb, to the best knower of Milton, and therefore the
  worthiest occupant of this pleasant edition.&mdash;Jan. 2nd, 1820."</blockquote>

The opening stanzas are unrivalled in their description of a sultry June
evening, with a thunder-storm imminent.

 <blockquote> ' 'Tis spent&mdash;this burning day of June!<br>
  Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing;<br>
  The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round, is wheeling,&mdash;<br>
  That solitary bird<br>
  Is all that can be heard<br>
  In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon!<br>
  ...<br>
  ...     <br>
  The mountains against heaven's grave weight<br>
  Rise up, and grow to wondrous height.<br>
  The air, as in a lion's den,<br>
  Is close and hot;&mdash;and now and then<br>
  Comes a tired and sultry breeze<br>
  With a haunting and a panting,<br>
  Like the stifling of disease;<br>
  But the dews allay the heat,<br>
  And the silence makes it sweet.'</blockquote>

The Waggoner takes what is now the middle road, of the three leading
from Rydal to Grasmere (see the note to <i>The Primrose of the Rock</i>). The
"craggy hill" referred to in the lines

 <blockquote> 'Now he leaves the lower ground,<br>
  And up the craggy hill ascending<br>
  ...      <br>
  Steep the way and wearisome,'</blockquote>

is the road from Rydal Quarry up to White Moss Common, with the Glowworm
rock on the right, and the "two heath-clad rocks," referred to in the
last of the "Poems on the Naming of Places," on the left. He next passes
"The Wishing Gate" on the left, John's Grove on the right, and descends
by Dove Cottage&mdash;where Wordsworth lived&mdash;to Grasmere.

  <blockquote>'... at the bottom of the brow,<br>
  Where once the <b>Dove</b> and <b>Olive-Bough</b><br>
  Offered a greeting of good ale<br>
  To all who entered Grasmere Vale;<br>
  And called on him who must depart<br>
  To leave it with a jovial heart;<br>
  There, where the <b>Dove</b> and <b>Olive-Bough</b><br>
  Once hung, a Poet harbours now,<br>
  A simple water-drinking Bard.'</blockquote>

He goes through Grasmere, passes the Swan Inn,

  '<blockquote>He knows it to his cost, good Man!<br>
  Who does not know the famous <b>Swan</b>?<br>
  Object uncouth! and yet our boast,<br>
  For it was painted by the Host;<br>
  His own conceit the figure planned,<br>
  'Twas coloured all by his own hand.'</blockquote>

As early as 1819, when the poem was first published, "this rude piece of
self-taught art had been supplanted" by a more pretentious figure. The
Waggoner passes the Swan,

 <blockquote> 'And now the conqueror essays<br>
  The long ascent of Dunmail-raise.'</blockquote>

As he proceeds, the storm gathers, and "struggles to get free." Road,
hill, and sky are dark; and he barely sees the well-known rocks at the
summit of Helm-crag, where two figures seem to sit, like those on the
Cobbler, near Arrochar, in Argyle.

  <blockquote>'Black is the sky&mdash;and every hill,<br>
  Up to the sky, is blacker still&mdash;<br>
  Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room,<br>
  Hung round and overhung with gloom;<br>
  Save that above a single height<br>
  Is to be seen a lurid light,<br>
  Above Helm-crag&mdash;a streak half dead,<br>
  A burning of portentous red;<br>
  And near that lurid light, full well<br>
  The <b>Astrologer</b>, sage Sidrophel,<br>
  Where at his desk and book he sits,<br>
  Puzzling aloft his curious wits;<br>
  He whose domain is held in common<br>
  With no one but the <b>Ancient Woman</b>,<br>
  Cowering beside her rifted cell,<br>
  As if intent on magic spell;&mdash;<br>
  Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,<br>
  Still sit upon Helm-crag together!'</blockquote>

At the top of the "raise"&mdash;the water-shed between the vales of Grasmere
and Wytheburn&mdash;he reaches the familiar pile of stones, at the boundary
between the shires of Westmoreland and Cumberland.

  <blockquote>'... that pile of stones,<br>
  Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;<br>
  ...<br>
  Green is the grass for beast to graze,<br>
  Around the stones of Dunmail-raise!'</blockquote>

The allusion to Seat-Sandal laid bare by the flash of lightning, and the
description, in the last canto, of the ascent of the Raise by the
Waggoner on a summer morning, are as true to the spirit of the place as
anything that Wordsworth has written. He tells his friend Lamb, fourteen
years after he wrote the poem of <i>The Waggoner,</i>

  <blockquote>'Yes, I, and all about me here,<br>
  Through all the changes of the year,<br>
  Had seen him through the mountains go,<br>
  In pomp of mist or pomp of snow,<br>
  Majestically huge and slow:<br>
  Or, with a milder grace adorning<br>
  The landscape of a summer's morning;<br>
  While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain<br>
  The moving image to detain;<br>
  And mighty Fairfield, with a chime<br>
  Of echoes, to his march kept time;<br>
  When little other business stirred,<br>
  And little other sound was heard;<br>
  In that delicious hour of balm,<br>
  Stillness, solitude, and calm,<br>
  While yet the valley is arrayed,<br>
  On this side with a sober shade;<br>
  On that is prodigally bright&mdash;<br>
  Crag, lawn, and wood&mdash;with rosy light.'</blockquote>

From Dunmail-raise the Waggoner descends to Wytheburn. Externally,

<blockquote>'... Wytheburn's modest House of prayer,<br>
  As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,'
</blockquote>
remains very much as it was in 1805; but the primitive simplicity and
"lowliness" of the chapel was changed by the addition a few years ago of
an apse, by the removal of some of the old rafters, and by the reseating
of the pews.<br>
<br>
The Cherry Tree Tavern, where "the village Merry-night" was being
celebrated, still stands on the eastern or Helvellyn side of the road.
It is now a farm-house; but it will be regarded with interest from the
description of the rustic dance, which recalls ('longo intervallo') 'The
Jolly Beggars' of Burns. After two hours' delay at the Cherry Tree, the
Waggoner and Sailor "coast the silent lake" of Thirlmere, and pass the
Rock of Names.<br>
<br>
This rock was, until lately, one of the most interesting memorials of
Wordsworth and his friends that survived in the Lake District; but the
vale of Thirlmere is now a Manchester water-tank, and the place which
knew the Rock of Names now knows it no more. It was a sort of trysting
place of the poets of Grasmere and Keswick&mdash;being nearly half-way
between the two places&mdash;and there, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and other
members of their households often met. When Coleridge left Grasmere for
Keswick, the Wordsworths usually accompanied him as far as this rock;
and they often met him there on his way over from Keswick to Grasmere.
Compare the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge's Reminiscences. (<i>Memoirs of
Wordsworth,</i> vol. ii. p. 310.)<br>
<br>
The rock was on the right hand of the road, a little way past Waterhead,
at the southern end of Thirlmere; and on it were cut the letters,

  <blockquote>W. W.<br>
  M. H.<br>
  D. W.<br>
  S. T. C.<br>
  J. W.<br>
  S. H.</blockquote>

the initials of William Wordsworth, Mary Hutchinson, Dorothy Wordsworth,
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Wordsworth, and Sarah Hutchinson. The
Wordsworths settled at Grasmere at the close of the year 1799. As
mentioned in a previous note, John Wordsworth lived with his brother and
sister during most of that winter, and during the whole of the spring,
summer, and autumn of 1800, leaving it finally on September 29, 1800.
These names must therefore have been cut during the spring or summer of
1800. There is no record of the occurrence, and no allusion to the rock,
in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Grasmere Journal</i> of 1800. But that Journal, so
far as I have seen it, begins on the 14th of May 1800. Almost every
detail of the daily life and ways of the household at Dove Cottage is so
minutely recorded in it, that I am convinced that this incident of the
cutting of names in the Thirlmere Rock would have been mentioned, had it
happened between the 14th of May and John Wordsworth's departure from
Grasmere in September. Such references as this, for example, occur in
the <i>Journal:</i>

  <blockquote>"Saturday, August 2.&mdash;William and Coleridge went to Keswick. John went
  with them to Wytheburn, and staid all day fishing."</blockquote>

I therefore infer that it was in the spring or early summer of 1800 that
the names were cut.<br>
<br>
I may add that the late Dean of Westminster&mdash;Dean Stanley&mdash;took much
interest in this Rock of Names; and doubt having been cast on the
accuracy of the place and the genuineness of the inscriptions, in a
letter from Dr. Fraser, then Bishop of Manchester, which he forwarded to
me, he entered into the question with all the interest with which he was
wont to track out details in the architecture or the history of a
Church.<br>
<br>
There were few memorials connected with Wordsworth more worthy of
preservation than this "upright mural block of stone." When one
remembered that the initials on the rock were graven by the hands of
William and John Wordsworth, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, possibly with
the assistance of Dorothy Wordsworth, the two Hutchinsons (Mary and
Sarah), and that Wordsworth says of it,

 <blockquote> 'We worked until the Initials took<br>
  Shapes that defied a scornful look,'</blockquote>

this Thirlmere Rock was felt to be a far more interesting memento of the
group of poets that used to meet beside it, than the Stone in the
grounds of Rydal Mount, which was spared at Wordsworth's suit, "from
some rude beauty of its own." There was simplicity, as well as strength,
in the way in which the initials were cut. But the stone was afterwards
desecrated by tourists, and others, who had the audacity to scratch
their own names or initials upon it. In 1877 I wrote, "The rock is as
yet wonderfully free from such; and its preservation is probably due to
the dark olive-coloured moss, with which the 'pure water trickling down'
has covered the face of the 'mural block,' and thus secured it from
observation, even on that highway;" but I found in the summer of 1882
that several other names had been ruthlessly added. When the Manchester
Thirlmere scheme was finally resolved upon, an effort was made to remove
the Stone, with the view of its being placed higher up the hill on the
side of the new roadway. In the course of this attempt, the Stone was
broken to pieces.<br>
<br>
There is a very good drawing of "The Rock of Names" by Mr. Harry
Goodwin, in <i>Through the Wordsworth Country, 1892</i>.<br>
<br>
"The Muse" takes farewell of the Waggoner as he is proceeding with the
Sailor and his quaint model of the <i>Vanguard</i> along the road toward
Keswick. She "scents the morning air," and

 <blockquote> 'Quits the slow-paced waggon's side,<br>
  To wander down yon hawthorn dell,<br>
  With murmuring Greta for her guide.'</blockquote>

The "hawthorn dell" is the upper part of the Vale of St. John.

  <blockquote>'&mdash;There doth she ken the awful form<br>
  Of Raven-crag&mdash;black as a storm&mdash;<br>
  Glimmering through the twilight pale;<br>
  And Ghimmer-crag, his tall twin brother,<br>
  Each peering forth to meet the other.'</blockquote>

Raven-crag is well known,&mdash;H.C. Robinson writes of it in his <i>Diary</i> in
1818, as "the most significant of the crags at a spot where there is not
one insignificant,"&mdash;a rock on the western side of Thirlmere, where the
Greta issues from the lake. But there is no rock in the district now
called by the name of Ghimmer-crag, or the crag of the Ewe-lamb. I am
inclined to think that Wordsworth referred to the "Fisher-crag" of the
Ordnance Survey and the Guide Books. No other rock round Thirlmere can
with any accuracy be called the "tall twin brother" of Raven-crag:
certainly not Great How, nor any spur of High Seat or Bleaberry Fell.
Fisher-crag resembles Raven-crag, as seen from Thirlmere Bridge, or from
the high road above it; and it is somewhat remarkable that Green&mdash;in his
Guide to the Lakes (a volume which the poet possessed)&mdash;makes use of the
same expression as that which Wordsworth adopts regarding these two
crags, Raven and Fisher. 

 <blockquote> "The margin of the lake on the Dalehead side has its charms of wood
  and water; and Fischer Crag, twin brother to Raven Crag, is no bad
  object, when taken near the island called Buck's Holm"</blockquote>

(<i>A Description of Sixty Studies from Nature</i>, by William Green of
Ambleside, 1810, p. 57). I cannot find any topographical allusion to a
Ghimmer-crag in contemporary local writers. Clarke, in his <i>Survey of
the Lakes</i>, does not mention it.<br>
<br>
The Castle Rock, in the Vale of Legberthwaite, between High Fell and
Great How, is the fairy castle of Sir Walter Scott's 'Bridal of
Triermain'. "Nathdale Fell" is the ridge between Naddle Vale (Nathdale
Vale) and that of St. John, now known as High Rigg. The old Hall of
Threlkeld has long been in a state of ruinous dilapidation, the only
habitable part of it having been for many years converted into a
farmhouse. The remaining local allusions in <i>The Waggoner</i> are obvious
enough: Castrigg is the shortened form of Castlerigg, the ridge between
Naddle Valley and Keswick.<br>
<br>
In the "Reminiscences" of Wordsworth, which the Hon. Mr. Justice
Coleridge wrote for the late Bishop of Lincoln, in 1850, there is the
following reference to <i>The Waggoner</i>. (See <i>Memoirs</i>, vol. ii. p. 310.)

  <blockquote>"<i>The Waggoner</i> seems a very favourite poem of his. He said his object
  in it had not been understood. It was a play of the fancy on a
  domestic incident, and lowly character. He wished by the opening
  descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he
  wished it to be read. If he failed in doing that, he wished him to lay
  it down. He pointed out with the same view, the glowing lines on the
  state of exultation in which Ben and his companions are under the
  influence of liquor. Then he read the sickening languor of the morning
  walk, contrasted with the glorious uprising of Nature, and the songs
  of the birds. Here he has added about six most exquisite lines." </blockquote>
  
The lines referred to are doubtless the eight (p. 101), beginning
  
  <blockquote>'Say more; for by that power a vein,'</blockquote>
  
which were added in the edition of 1836.<br>
<br>
The following is Sara Coleridge's criticism of <i>The Waggoner</i>. (See
<i>Biographia Literaria</i>, vol. ii. pp. 183, 184, edition 1847.)

 <blockquote> "Due honour is done to 'Peter Bell', at this time, by students of
  poetry in general; but some, even of Mr. Wordsworth's greatest
  admirers, do not quite satisfy me in their admiration of 'The
  Waggoner', a poem which my dear uncle, Mr. Southey, preferred even to
  the former. 'Ich will meine Denkungs Art hierin niemandem aufdringen',
  as Lessing says: I will force my way of thinking on nobody, but take
  the liberty, for my own gratification, to express it. The sketches of
  hill and valley in this poem have a lightness, and spirit&mdash;an Allegro
  touch&mdash;distinguishing them from the grave and elevated splendour which
  characterises Mr. Wordsworth's representations of Nature in general,
  and from the passive tenderness of those in 'The White Doe', while it
  harmonises well with the human interest of the piece; indeed it is the
  harmonious sweetness of the composition which is most dwelt upon by
  its special admirers. In its course it describes, with bold brief
  touches, the striking mountain tract from Grasmere to Keswick; it
  commences with an evening storm among the mountains, presents a lively
  interior of a country inn during midnight, and concludes after
  bringing us in sight of St. John's Vale and the Vale of Keswick seen
  by day-break&mdash;'Skiddaw touched with rosy light,' and the prospect from
  Nathdale Fell 'hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn:' thus giving a
  beautiful and well-contrasted Panorama, produced by the most delicate
  and masterly strokes of the pencil. Well may Mr. Ruskin, a fine
  observer and eloquent describer of various classes of natural
  appearances, speak of Mr. Wordsworth as the great poetic landscape
  painter of the age. But Mr. Ruskin has found how seldom the great
  landscape painters are powerful in expressing human passions and
  affections on canvas, or even successful in the introduction of human
  figures into their foregrounds; whereas in the poetic paintings of Mr.
  Wordsworth the landscape is always subordinate to a higher interest;
  certainly, in 'The Waggoner', the little sketch of human nature which
  occupies, as it were, the front of that encircling background, the
  picture of Benjamin and his temptations, his humble friends and the
  mute companions of his way, has a character of its own, combining with
  sportiveness a homely pathos, which must ever be delightful to some of
  those who are thoroughly conversant with the spirit of Mr.
  Wordsworth's poetry. It may be compared with the ale-house scene in
  'Tam o'Shanter', parts of Voss's Luise, or Ovid's Baucis and Philemon;
  though it differs from each of them as much as they differ from each
  other. The Epilogue carries on the feeling of the piece very
  beautifully."</blockquote>

The editor of Southey's <i>Life and Correspondence</i>&mdash;his son, the Rev.
Charles Cuthbert Southey&mdash;tells us, in a note to a letter from S.T.
Coleridge to his father, that the Waggoner's name was Jackson; and that
"all the circumstances of the poem are accurately correct." This
Jackson, after retiring from active work as waggoner, became the tenant
of Greta Hall, where first Coleridge, and afterwards Southey lived. The
Hall was divided into two houses, one of which Jackson occupied, and the
other of which he let to Coleridge, who speaks thus of him in the letter
to Southey, dated Greta Hall, Keswick, April 13, 1801:

  <blockquote>"My landlord, who dwells next door, has a very respectable library,
  which he has put with mine; histories, encyclopedias, and all the
  modern poetry, etc. etc. etc. A more truly disinterested man I never
  met with; severely frugal, yet almost carelessly generous; and yet he
  got all his money as a common carrier, by hard labour, and by pennies
  and pennies. He is one instance among many in this country of the
  salutary effect of the love of knowledge&mdash;he was from a boy a lover of
  learning." </blockquote>
  
(See '<i>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey,</i> vol. ii. pp. 147,
148.)<br>
<br>
Charles Lamb&mdash;to whom <i>The Waggoner</i> was dedicated&mdash;wrote thus to
Wordsworth on 7th June 1819:

 <blockquote> "My dear Wordsworth,&mdash;You cannot imagine how proud we are here of the
  dedication. We read it twice for once that we do the poem. I mean all
  through; yet <i>Benjamin</i> is no common favourite; there is a spirit of
  beautiful tolerance in it. It is as good as it was in 1806; and it
  will be as good in 1829, if our dim eyes shall be awake to peruse it.
  Methinks there is a kind of shadowing affinity between the subject of
  the narrative and the subject of the dedication.<br>
   ...<br>
  "I do not know which I like best,&mdash;the prologue (the latter part
  especially) to <i>P. Bell,</i> or the epilogue to <i>Benjamin.</i> Yes, I tell
  stories; I do know I like the last best; and the <i>Waggoner</i> altogether
  is a pleasanter remembrance to me than the <i>Itinerant.</i><br>
  ...<br>
  "<b>C. Lamb</b>."</blockquote>

(See <i>The Letters of Charles Lamb,</i> edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. ii.
pp. 24-26.)<br>
<br>
To this may be added what Southey wrote to Mr. Wade Browne on 15th June
1819:

 <blockquote> "I think you will be pleased with Wordsworth's <i>Waggoner</i>, if it were
  only for the line of road which it describes. The master of the waggon
  was my poor landlord Jackson, and the cause of his exchanging it for
  the one-horse cart was just as is represented in the poem; nobody but
  Benjamin could manage it upon these hills, and Benjamin could not
  resist the temptations by the wayside."</blockquote>
