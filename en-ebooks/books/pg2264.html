<p id="id00014" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id00015" style="margin-top: 2em">We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.</p>

<p id="id00016">Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.</p>

<p id="id00017" style="margin-top: 2em">Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p id="id00018">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.</p>

<p id="id00019">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p id="id00020">At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.</p>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.</p>

<p id="id00037">*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept

<p id="id00038">ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p id="id00039">To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR

<p id="id00041">If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.</p>

<p id="id00054" style="margin-top: 5em">Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie of Macbeth</p>

<p id="id00055" style="margin-top: 5em">Executive Director's Notes:</p>

<p id="id00056">In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
are presented herein:</p>

<p id="id00057">  Barnardo. Who's there?<br/>

  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand &amp; vnfold<br/>

your selfe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00058">   Bar. Long liue the King</p>

<p id="id00059">***</p>

<p id="id00060">As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .</p>

<p id="id00061">The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.</p>

<p id="id00062">You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.</p>

<p id="id00063">So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
that are "not" errors. . . .</p>

<p id="id00064">So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie
of Macbeth.</p>

<p id="id00066" style="margin-top: 2em">***</p>

<p id="id00067" style="margin-top: 2em">Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text.</p>

<p id="id00068">The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare.</p>

<p id="id00069">Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions' best pages.</p>

<p id="id00070">If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.</p>

Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from
the King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title
before, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to
the comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This
haue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of
Greatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing
by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay
it to thy heart and farewell.
Glamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
What thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,
It is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,
To catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,
Art not without Ambition, but without
The illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,
That would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,
And yet would'st wrongly winne.
Thould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,
Thus thou must doe, if thou haue it;
And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,
Then wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,
That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,
And chastise with the valour of my Tongue
All that impeides thee from the Golden Round,
Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme
To haue thee crown'd withall.

prouoke?
  Port. Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.
Lecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes
the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore
much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:
it makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,
and it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens
him; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,
equiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,
leaues him</p>

Whose being I doe feare: and vnder him,<br/>

My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said<br/>

Mark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,<br/>

When first they put the Name of King vpon me,<br/>

And bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,<br/>

They hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.<br/>

This I made good to you, in our last conference,<br/>

Past in probation with you:<br/>

How you were borne in hand, how crost:<br/>

In your nature, that you can let this goe?<br/>

Are you so Gospell'd, to pray for this good man,<br/>

And for his Issue, whose heauie hand<br/>

With bare-fac'd power sweepe him from my sight,<br/>

And bid my will auouch it; yet I must not,<br/>

For certaine friends that are both his, and mine,<br/>

Whose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,<br/>

Who I my selfe struck downe: and thence it is,<br/>

That I to your assistance doe make loue,<br/>

Masking the Businesse from the common Eye,<br/>

Haue but hit your Thoughts<br/>

Which can interpret farther: Onely I say<br/>

Things haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan<br/>

Was pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:<br/>

And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,<br/>

Whom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,<br/>

For Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.<br/>

Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous<br/>

It was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane<br/>

To kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,<br/>

How it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight<br/>

In pious rage, the two delinquents teare,<br/>

That were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?<br/>

Was not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:<br/>

For 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue<br/>

To heare the men deny't. So that I say,<br/>

He ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,<br/>

That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,<br/>

(As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde<br/>

What 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.<br/>

But peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd<br/>

His presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare<br/>

Macduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell<br/>

Where he bestowes himselfe?<br/>

  Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane<br/>

(From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)<br/>

Liues in the English Court, and is receyu'd<br/>

Of the most Pious Edward, with such grace,<br/>

That the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing<br/>

Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe<br/>

Is gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd<br/>

To wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,<br/>

That by the helpe of these (with him aboue)<br/>

To ratifie the Worke) we may againe<br/>

Giue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:<br/>

Free from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;<br/>

I haue done no harme. But I remember now<br/>

I am in this earthly world: where to do harme<br/>

Is often laudable, to do good sometime<br/>

Accounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)<br/>

Do I put vp that womanly defence,<br/>

To say I haue done no harme?<br/>

What are these faces?<br/>

In an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:<br/>

That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;<br/>

Though all things foule, would wear the brows of grace<br/>

Yet Grace must still looke so<br/>

Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,<br/>

I speake not as in absolute feare of you:<br/>

I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,<br/>

It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash<br/>

Is added to her wounds. I thinke withall,<br/>

There would be hands vplifted in my right:<br/>

And heere from gracious England haue I offer<br/>

Of goodly thousands. But for all this,<br/>

When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,<br/>

Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country<br/>

Shall haue more vices then it had before,<br/>

More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,<br/>

By him that shall succeede<br/>

All the particulars of Vice so grafted,<br/>

That when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth<br/>

Will seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State<br/>

Esteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd<br/>

With my confinelesse harmes<br/>

Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,<br/>

Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne<br/>

That ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none<br/>

In my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,<br/>

Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp<br/>

The Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire<br/>

All continent Impediments would ore-beare<br/>

That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,<br/>

Then such an one to reigne<br/>

In Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene<br/>

Th' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,<br/>

And fall of many Kings. But feare not yet<br/>

To take vpon you what is yours: you may<br/>

Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,<br/>

And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:<br/>

We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be<br/>

That Vulture in you, to deuoure so many<br/>

In my most ill-composd Affection, such<br/>

A stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,<br/>

I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,<br/>

Desire his Iewels, and this others House,<br/>

And my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce<br/>

To make me hunger more, that I should forge<br/>

Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,<br/>

Destroying them for wealth<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00571">   Macd. This Auarice<br/>

stickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote<br/>

Then Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin<br/>

The Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,<br/>

Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will<br/>

Of your meere Owne. All these are portable,<br/>

With other Graces weigh'd<br/>

As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,<br/>

Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,<br/>

Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,<br/>

I haue no rellish of them, but abound<br/>

In the diuision of each seuerall Crime,<br/>

Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should<br/>

Poure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,<br/>

Vprore the vniuersall peace, confound<br/>

All vnity on earth<br/>

With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,<br/>

When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?<br/>

Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne<br/>

By his owne Interdiction stands accust,<br/>

And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father<br/>

Was a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,<br/>

Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,<br/>

Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,<br/>

These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,<br/>

Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,<br/>

Thy hope ends heere<br/>

Childe of integrity, hath from my soule<br/>

Wip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts<br/>

To thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,<br/>

By many of these traines, hath sought to win me<br/>

Into his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me<br/>

From ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue<br/>

Deale betweene thee and me; For euen now<br/>

I put my selfe to thy Direction, and<br/>

Vnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure<br/>

The taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,<br/>

For strangers to my Nature. I am yet<br/>

Vnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,<br/>

Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.<br/>

At no time broke my Faith, would not betray<br/>

The Deuill to his Fellow, and delight<br/>

No lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking<br/>

Was this vpon my selfe. What I am truly<br/>

Is thine, and my poore Countries to command:<br/>

Whither indeed, before they heere approach<br/>

Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men<br/>

Already at a point, was setting foorth:<br/>

Now wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse<br/>

Be like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?<br/>

'Tis hard to reconcile.<br/>

Enter a Doctor.<br/>

<p id="id00577">  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth<br/>

I pray you?<br/>

  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules<br/>

That stay his Cure: their malady conuinces<br/>

The great assay of Art. But at his touch,<br/>

Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,<br/>

They presently amend.<br/>

Enter.<br/>

<p id="id00578">  Mal. I thanke you Doctor</p>

  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.<br/>

A most myraculous worke in this good King,<br/>

Which often since my heere remaine in England,<br/>

I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen<br/>

Himselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people<br/>

All swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,<br/>

The meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,<br/>

Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes,<br/>

Put on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken<br/>

To the succeeding Royalty he leaues<br/>

The healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,<br/>

He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,<br/>

And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,<br/>

That speake him full of Grace.<br/>

Enter Rosse.<br/>

<p id="id00585">   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?<br/>

  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,<br/>

Almost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot<br/>

Be call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing<br/>

But who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:<br/>

Where sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre<br/>

Are made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes<br/>

A Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,<br/>

Is there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues<br/>

Expire before the Flowers in their Caps,<br/>

Dying, or ere they sicken<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00586">   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true</p>

<p id="id00587">   Malc. What's the newest griefe?<br/>

  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,<br/>

Each minute teemes a new one<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00588">   Macd. How do's my Wife?<br/>

  Rosse. Why well<br/>

<p id="id00589">   Macd. And all my Children?<br/>

  Rosse. Well too<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00590">   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?<br/>

  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em<br/>

  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?<br/>

  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings<br/>

Which I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour<br/>

Of many worthy Fellowes, that were out,<br/>

Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,<br/>

For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.<br/>

Now is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland<br/>

Would create Soldiours, make our women fight,<br/>

To doffe their dire distresses<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00591">   Malc. Bee't their comfort<br/>

We are comming thither: Gracious England hath<br/>

Lent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,<br/>

An older, and a better Souldier, none<br/>

That Christendome giues out<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00592">   Rosse. Would I could answer<br/>

This comfort with the like. But I haue words<br/>

That would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,<br/>

Where hearing should not latch them<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00593">   Macd. What concerne they,<br/>

The generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe<br/>

Due to some single brest?<br/>

  Rosse. No minde that's honest<br/>

But in it shares some woe, though the maine part<br/>

Pertaines to you alone<br/>

<p id="id00594">   Macd. If it be mine<br/>

Keepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it<br/>

Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound
that euer yet they heard</p>

<p id="id00596">   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it</p>

<p id="id00597">   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes<br/>

Sauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner<br/>

Were on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere<br/>

To adde the death of you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00598">   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:<br/>

What man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:<br/>

Giue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,<br/>

Whispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00599">   Macd. My Children too?<br/>

  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found<br/>

Let's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,<br/>

To cure this deadly greefe<br/>

<p id="id00602">   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?<br/>

Did you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?<br/>

What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme<br/>

At one fell swoope?<br/>

  Malc. Dispute it like a man<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00603">   Macd. I shall do so:<br/>

But I must also feele it as a man;<br/>

I cannot but remember such things were<br/>

That were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,<br/>

And would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,<br/>

They were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,<br/>

Not for their owne demerits, but for mine<br/>

Fell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00604">   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe<br/>

Conuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00605">   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,<br/>

And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,<br/>

Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,<br/>

Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe<br/>

Within my Swords length set him, if he scape<br/>

Heauen forgiue him too<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00606">   Mal. This time goes manly:<br/>

Come go we to the King, our Power is ready,<br/>

Our lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth<br/>

Is ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue<br/>

Put on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,<br/>

The Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.<br/>
