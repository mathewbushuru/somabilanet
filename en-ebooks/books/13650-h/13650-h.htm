	<h1>INTRODUCTION.</h1>
	<hr />

	<p>
	Edward Lear, the artist, Author of "Journals
	of a Landscape Painter" in various out-of-the-way
	countries, and of the delightful "Books of Nonsense,"
	which have amused successive generations of children,
	died on Sunday, January 29, 1888, at San Remo, Italy,
	where he had lived for twenty years. Few names
	could evoke a wider expression of passing regret at
	their appearance in the obituary column; for until his
	health began to fail he was known to an immense and
	almost a cosmopolitan circle of acquaintance, and popular
	wherever he was known. Fewer still could call
	up in the minds of intimate friends a deeper and more
	enduring feeling of sorrow for personal loss, mingled
	with the pleasantest of memories; for it was impossible
	to know him thoroughly and not to love him. London,
	Rome, the Mediterranean countries generally, Ceylon
	and India, are still all dotted with survivors among
	his generation who will mourn for him affectionately,
	although his latter years were spent in comparatively
	close retirement. He was a man of striking
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page008" id="page008" title="008"></a>
	nobility of nature, fearless, independent, energetic,
	given to forming for himself strong opinions, often hastily,
	sometimes bitterly; not always strong or sound in
	judgment, but always seeking after truth in every matter,
	and following it as he understood it in scorn of
	consequence; utterly unselfish, devoted to his friends,
	generous even to extravagance towards any one who
	had ever been connected with his fortunes or his
	travels; playful, light-hearted, witty, and humorous,
	but not without those occasional fits of black depression
	and nervous irritability to which such temperaments
	are liable.
	</p>
	<p>
	Great and varied as the merits of his pictures are,
	Lear hardly succeeded in achieving any great popularity
	as a landscape-painter. His work was frequently
	done on private commission, and he rarely sent in pictures
	for the Academy or other exhibitions. His larger
	and more highly finished landscapes were unequal in
	technical perfection,&#8212;sometimes harsh or cold in
	color, or stiff in composition; sometimes full of imagination,
	at others literal and prosaic,&#8212;but always
	impressive reproductions of interesting or peculiar scenery.
	In later years he used in conversation to qualify
	himself as a "topographical artist;" and the definition
	was true, though not exhaustive. He had an intuitive
	and a perfectly trained eye for the character and
	beauty of distant mountain lines, the solemnity of rocky
	gorges, the majesty of a single mountain rising from
	a base of plain or sea; and he was equally exact in
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page009" id="page009" title="009"></a>
	rendering the true forms of the middle distances and
	the specialties of foreground detail belonging to the
	various lands through which he had wandered as a
	sketcher. Some of his pictures show a mastery which
	has rarely been equalled over the difficulties of painting
	an immense plain as seen from a height, reaching
	straight away from the eye of the spectator until it is
	lost in a dim horizon. Sir Roderick Murchison used
	to say that he always understood the geological peculiarities
	of a country he had only studied in Lear's
	sketches. The compliment was thoroughly justified;
	and it is not every landscape-painter to whom it could
	honestly be paid.
	</p>
	<p>
	The history of Lear's choice of a career was a curious
	one. He was the youngest of twenty-one children,
	and, through a family mischance, was thrown entirely
	on the limited resources of an elderly sister at a very
	early age. As a boy he had always dabbled in colors
	for his own amusement, and had been given to poring
	over the ordinary boys' books upon natural history.
	It occurred to him to try to turn his infant talents to
	account; and he painted upon cardboard a couple of
	birds in the style which the older among us remember
	as having been called Oriental tinting, took them to a
	small shop, and sold them for fourpence. The kindness
	of friends, to whom he was ever grateful, gave
	him the opportunity of more serious and more remunerative
	study, and he became a patient and accurate
	zo&ouml;logical draughtsman. Many of the birds in the
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page010" id="page010" title="010"></a>
	earlier volumes of Gould's magnificent folios were
	drawn for him by Lear. A few years back there were
	eagles alive in the Zo&ouml;logical Gardens in Regent's
	Park to which Lear could point as old familiar friends
	that he had drawn laboriously from claw to beak fifty
	years before. He united with this kind of work the
	more unpleasant occupation of drawing the curiosities
	of disease or deformity in hospitals. One day, as he
	was busily intent on the portrait of a bird in the Zo&ouml;logical
	Gardens, an old gentleman came and looked
	over his shoulder, entered into conversation, and finally
	said to him, "You must come and draw my birds at
	Knowsley." Lear did not know where Knowsley was,
	or what it meant; but the old gentleman was the
	thirteenth Earl of Derby. The successive Earls of
	Derby have been among Lear's kindest and most generous
	patrons. He went to Knowsley, and the drawings
	in the "Knowsley Menagerie" (now a rare and highly-prized
	work among book collectors) are by Lear's
	hand. At Knowsley he became a permanent favorite;
	and it was there that he composed in prolific succession
	his charming and wonderful series of utterly nonsensical
	rhymes and drawings. Lear had already begun seriously
	to study landscape. When English winters began
	to threaten his health, Lord Derby started a
	subscription which enabled him to go to Rome as a
	student and artist, and no doubt gave him recommendations
	among Anglo-Roman society which laid the
	foundations of a numerous <i>client&egrave;le</i>. It was in the
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page011" id="page011" title="011"></a>
	Roman summers that Lear first began to exercise
	the taste for pictorial wandering which grew into a
	habit and a passion, to fill vivid and copious note-books
	as he went, and to illustrate them by spirited and accurate
	drawings; and his first volume of "Illustrated
	Excursions in Italy," published in 1846, is gratefully
	dedicated to his Knowsley patron.
	</p>
	<p>
	Only those who have travelled with him could know
	what a delightful comrade he was to men whose tastes
	ran more or less parallel to his own. It was not everybody
	who could travel with him; for he was so irrepressibly
	anxious not to lose a moment of the time at
	his disposal for gathering into his garners the beauty
	and interest of the lands over which he journeyed, that
	he was careless of comfort and health. Calabria, Sicily,
	the Desert of Sinai, Egypt and Nubia, Greece and
	Albania, Palestine, Syria, Athos, Candia, Montenegro,
	Zag&oacute;ri (who knows now where Zag&oacute;ri is, or was?),
	were as thoroughly explored and sketched by him as
	the more civilized localities of Malta, Corsica, and
	Corfu. He read insatiably before starting all the recognized
	guide-books and histories of the country he
	intended to draw; and his published itineraries are
	marked by great strength and literary interest quite
	irrespectively of the illustrations. And he had
	his reward. It is not any ordinary journalist and
	sketcher who could have compelled from Tennyson
	such a tribute as lines "To E.L. on his Travels in
	Greece":&#8212;
		<a class="pagenumber" name="page012" id="page012" title="012"></a>						</p>
	<blockquote>
			<p>
			"Illyrian woodlands, echoing falls<br />
			<span class="i2">Of water, sheets of summer glass,</span>
			<span class="i2">The long divine Pene&iuml;an pass,</span>
			The vast Akrokeraunian walls,
			</p>
			<p>
			"Tomohrit, Athos, all things fair,<br />
			<span class="i2">With such a pencil, such a pen,</span>
			<span class="i2">You shadow forth to distant men,</span>
			I read and felt that I was there."
			</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	Lear was a man to whom, as to Tennyson's Ulysses,
	</p>
	<blockquote>
			<p>
			"All experience is an arch wherethrough<br />
			Gleams that untravelled world."
			</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	After settling at San Remo, and when he was nearly
	sixty years old, he determined to visit India and Ceylon.
	He started once and failed, being taken so ill at Suez
	that he was obliged to return. The next year he succeeded,
	and brought away some thousands of drawings
	of the most striking views from all three Presidencies
	and from the tropical island. His appetite for travel
	continued to grow with what it fed upon; and although
	he hated a long sea-voyage, he used seriously
	to contemplate as possible a visit to relations in New
	Zealand. It may safely, however, be averred that no
	considerations would have tempted him to visit the
	Arctic regions.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	A hard-working life, checkered by the odd adventures
	which happen to the odd and the adventurous
	and pass over the commonplace; a career brightened
	by the high appreciation of unimpeachable critics;
	lightened, till of late, by the pleasant society and good
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page013" id="page013" title="013"></a>
	wishes of innumerable friends; saddened by the growing
	pressure of ill health and solitude; cheered by his
	constant trust in the love and sympathy of those who
	knew him best, however far away,&#8212;such was the life
	of Edward Lear.<br />

	Among the writers who have striven with varying
	success during the last thirty or forty years to awaken
	the merriment of the "rising generation" of the time
	being, Mr. Edward Lear occupies the first place in
	seniority, if not in merit. The parent of modern nonsense-writers,
	he is distinguished from all his followers
	and imitators by the superior consistency with which
	he has adhered to his aim,&#8212;that of amusing his readers
	by fantastic absurdities, as void of vulgarity or
	cynicism as they are incapable of being made to harbor
	any symbolical meaning. He "never deviates into
	sense;" but those who appreciate him never feel the
	need of such deviation. He has a genius for coining
	absurd names and words, which, even when they are
	suggested by the exigencies of his metre, have a ludicrous
	appropriateness to the matter in hand. His
	verse is, with the exception of a certain number
	of cockney rhymes, wonderfully flowing and even
	melodious&#8212;or, as he would say, <i>meloobious</i>&#8212; while
	to all these qualifications for his task must finally
	be added the happy gift of pictorial expression, enabling
	him to double, nay, often to quadruple, the
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page014" id="page014" title="014"></a>
	laughable effect of his text by an inexhaustible profusion
	of the quaintest designs. Generally speaking,
	these designs are, as it were, an idealization of the
	efforts of a clever child; but now and then&#8212;as in the
	case of the nonsense-botany&#8212;Mr. Lear reminds us
	what a genuine and graceful artist he really is. The
	advantage to a humorist of being able to illustrate his
	own text has been shown in the case of Thackeray and
	Mr. W. S. Gilbert, to mention two familiar examples;
	but in no other instance of such a combination have we
	discovered such geniality as is to be found in the nonsense-pictures
	of Mr. Lear. We have spoken above of
	the melodiousness of Mr. Lear's verses, a quality which
	renders them excellently suitable for musical setting,
	and which has not escaped the notice of the author
	himself. We have also heard effective arrangements,
	presumably by other composers, of the adventures of
	the Table and the Chair, and of the cruise of the Owl
	and the Pussy-cat,&#8212;the latter introduced into the
	"drawing-room entertainment" of one of the followers
	of John Parry. Indeed, in these days of adaptations,
	it is to be wondered at that no enterprising librettist
	has attempted to build a children's comic opera out of
	the materials supplied in the four books with which
	we are now concerned. The first of these, originally
	published in 1846, and brought out in an enlarged form
	in 1863, is exclusively devoted to nonsense-verses of one
	type. Mr. Lear is careful to disclaim the credit of
	having created this type, for he tells us in the preface
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page015" id="page015" title="015"></a>
	to his third book that "the lines beginning, 'There was
	an old man of Tobago,' were suggested to me by a
	valued friend, as a form of verse leading itself to limitless
	variety for Rhymes and Pictures." Dismissing the
	further question of the authorship of "There was an
	old man of Tobago," we propose to give a few specimens
	of Mr. Lear's Protean powers as exhibited in the
	variation of this simple type. Here, to begin with, is
	a favorite verse, which we are very glad to have an
	opportunity of giving, as it is often incorrectly quoted,
	"cocks" being substituted for "owls" in the third line:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
			<p>
			There was an Old Man with a beard,<br />
			Who said, 'It is just as I feared!<br />
			Two Owls and a Hen, four Larks and a Wren,<br />
			Have all built their nests in my beard!'"
			</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	With the kindly fatalism which is the distinctive note
	of the foregoing stanza, the sentiment of our next extract
	is in vivid contrast:&#8212;
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		"There was an Old Man in a tree,<br />
		Who was terribly bored by a bee;<br />
		When they said, 'Does it buzz?' he replied, 'Yes, it does!<br />
		It's a regular brute of a Bee.'"
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	To the foregoing verse an historic interest attaches,
	if, that is, we are right in supposing it to have inspired
	Mr. Gilbert with his famous "Nonsense-Rhyme in
	Blank Verse." We quote from memory:&#8212;
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		"There was an Old Man of St. Bees,<br />
		Who was stung in the arm by a wasp.<br />
		When they asked, 'Does it hurt?' he replied, 'No, it doesn't,<br />
		But I thought all the while 'twas a Hornet!'"
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page016" id="page016" title="016"></a>
	Passing over the lines referring to the "Young Person"
	of Crete to whom the epithet "ombliferous" is applied,
	we may be pardoned&#8212;on the ground of the geographical
	proximity of the two countries named&#8212;for quoting
	together two stanzas which in reality are separated
	by a good many pages:&#8212;
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		"There was a Young Lady of Norway,<br />
		Who casually sat in a doorway;<br />
		When the doors queezed her flat, she exclaimed, 'What of that?'<br />
		This courageous young person of Norway."
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		"There was a Young Lady of Sweden,<br />
		Who went by the slow train to Weedon;<br />
		When they cried, 'Weedon Station!' she made no observation,<br />
		But thought she should go back to Sweden."
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	A noticeable feature about this first book, and one
	which we think is peculiar to it, is the harsh treatment
	which the eccentricities of the inhabitants of certain
	towns appear to have met with at the hands of
	their fellow-residents. No less than three people are
	"smashed,"&#8212;the Old Man of Whitehaven "who
	danced a quadrille with a Raven;" the Old Person of
	Buda; and the Old Man with a gong "who bumped at
	it all the day long," though in the last-named case we
	admit that there was considerable provocation. Before
	quitting the first "Nonsense-Book," we would point
	out that it contains one or two forms that are interesting;
	for instance, "scroobious," which we take
	to be a Portmanteau word, and "spickle-speckled,"
	a favorite form of reduplication with Mr. Lear, and
	of which the best specimen occurs in his last book,
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page017" id="page017" title="017"></a>
	"He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled the bell." The second
	book, published in 1871, shows Mr. Lear in the
	maturity of sweet desipience, and will perhaps remain
	the favorite volume of the four to grown-up readers.
	The nonsense-songs are all good, and "The Story of
	the Four little Children who went Round the World"
	is the most exquisite piece of imaginative absurdity
	that the present writer is acquainted with. But before
	coming to that, let us quote a few lines from "The
	Jumblies," who, as all the world knows, went to sea in
	a sieve:&#8212;
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		<span class="i2">"They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,</span>
		<span class="i2">To a land all covered with trees.</span>
		And they bought an Owl, and a useful Cart,<br />
		And a pound of Rice, and a Cranberry Tart,<br />
		<span class="i2">And a hive of silvery Bees.</span>
		And they bought a Pig, and some green Jack-Daws,<br />
		And a lovely Monkey with lollipop paws,<br />
		And forty bottles of Ring-Bo-Ree,<br />
		<span class="i2">And no end of Stilton Cheese.</span>
		<i><span class="i4">Far and few, far and few,</span>
		<span class="i6">Are the lands where the Jumblies live.</span>
		<span class="i4">Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</span>
		<span class="i6">And they went to sea in a sieve.</span></i>
		</p>
		<p>
		And in twenty years they all came back,<br />
		<span class="i2">In twenty years or more,</span>
		And every one said, 'How tall they've grown!<br />
		For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,<br />
		<span class="i2">And the hills of the Chankly Bore.'"</span>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	From the pedestrian excursion of the Table and the
	Chair, we cannot resist making a brief quotation,
	though in this, as in every case, the inability to quote
	the drawings also is a sad drawback:&#8212;
		<a class="pagenumber" name="page018" id="page018" title="018"></a>						</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		"So they both went slowly down,<br />
		And walked about the town,<br />
		With a cheerful bumpy sound,<br />
		As they toddled round and round.<br />
		And everybody cried,<br />
		As they hastened to their side,<br />
		'See, the Table and the Chair<br />
		Have come out to take the air!'
		</p>
		<p>
		"But in going down an alley<br />
		To a castle in a valley,<br />
		They completely lost their way,<br />
		And wandered all the day,<br />
		Till, to see them safely back,<br />
		They paid a Ducky-Quack,<br />
		And a Beetle and a Mouse,<br />
		Who took them to their house.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Then they whispered to each other,<br />
		'O delightful little brother,<br />
		What a lovely walk we've taken!<br />
		Let us dine on Beans and Bacon!'<br />
		So the Ducky and the leetle<br />
		Browny-Mousy, and the Beetle<br />
		Dined, and danced upon their heads,<br />
		Till they toddled to their beds."
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	"The Story of the Four little Children who went
	Round the World" follows next, and the account of
	the manner in which they occupied themselves while
	on shipboard may be transcribed for the benefit of
	those unfortunate persons who have not perused the
	original: "During the day-time Violet chiefly occupied
	herself in putting salt-water into a churn, while
	her three brothers churned it violently in the hope
	it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page019" id="page019" title="019"></a>
	did." After journeying for a time, they saw some
	land at a distance, "and when they came to it they
	found it was an island made of water quite surrounded
	by earth. Besides that it was bordered by
	evanescent isthmuses with a great Gulf-Stream running
	about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful,
	and contained only a single tree, five hundred
	and three feet high." In a later passage, we read
	how "by-and-by the children came to a country
	where there were no houses, but only an incredibly
	innumerable number of large bottles without corks,
	and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color.
	Each of these blue bottles contained a bluebottlefly,
	and all these interesting animals live continually
	together in the most copious and rural harmony,
	nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such
	perfect and abject happiness to be found." Our last
	quotation from this inimitable recital shall be from
	the description of their adventure on a great plain
	where they espied an object which "on a nearer
	approach and on an accurately cutaneous inspection,
	seemed to be somebody in a large white wig sitting on
	an arm-chair made of sponge-cake and oyster-shells."
	This turned out to be the "Co-operative Cauliflower,"
	who, "while the whole party from the boat was gazing
	at him with mingled affection and disgust ... suddenly
	arose, and in a somewhat plumdomphious manner
	hurried off towards the setting sun, his steps supported
	by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page020" id="page020" title="020"></a>
	... till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western
	sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand. So remarkable
	a sight of course impressed the four children very
	deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat
	with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great
	appetite."
	</p>
	<p>
	In his third book, Mr. Lear takes occasion in an
	entertaining preface to repudiate the charge of harboring
	any ulterior motive beyond that of "Nonsense
	pure and absolute" in any of his verses or pictures,
	and tells a delightful anecdote illustrative of the "persistently
	absurd report" that the Earl of Derby was the
	author of the first book of "Nonsense." In this volume
	he reverts once more to the familiar form adopted in
	his original efforts, and with little falling off. It is to
	be remarked that the third division is styled "Twenty-Six
	Nonsense Rhymes and Pictures," although there is
	no more rhyme than reason in any of the set. Our
	favorite illustrations are those of the "Scroobious
	Snake who always wore a Hat on his Head, for fear he
	should bite anybody," and the "Visibly Vicious Vulture
	who wrote some Verses to a Veal-cutlet in a
	Volume bound in Vellum." In the fourth and last of
	Mr. Lear's books, we meet not only with familiar words,
	but personages and places,&#8212;old friends like the Jumblies,
	the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo, the Quangle Wangle,
	the hills of the Chankly Bore, and the great Gromboolian
	plain, as well as new creations, such as the Dong
	with a luminous Nose, whose story is a sort of nonsense
	<a class="pagenumber" name="page021" id="page021" title="021"></a>
	 version of the love of Nausicaa for Ulysses, only
	that the sexes are inverted. In these verses, graceful
	fancy is so subtly interwoven with nonsense as almost
	to beguile us into feeling a real interest in Mr. Lear's
	absurd creations. So again in the Pelican chorus there
	are some charming lines:&#8212;
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		"By day we fish, and at eve we stand<br />
		On long bare islands of yellow sand.<br />
		And when the sun sinks slowly down,<br />
		And the great rock-walls grow dark and brown,<br />
		When the purple river rolls fast and dim,<br />
		And the ivory Ibis starlike skim,<br />
		Wing to wing we dance around," etc.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	The other nonsense-poems are all good, but we have
	no space for further quotation, and will take leave of
	our subject by propounding the following set of examination
	questions which a friend who is deeply versed
	in Mr. Lear's books has drawn up for us:&#8212;
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		1. What do you gather from a study of Mr. Lear's works to
		have been the prevalent characteristics of the inhabitants of
		Gretna, Prague, Thermopylae, Wick, and Hong Kong?
		</p>
		<p>
		2. State briefly what historical events are connected with
		Ischia, Chertsey, Whitehaven, Boulak, and Jellibolee.
		</p>
		<p>
		3. Comment, with illustrations, upon Mr. Lear's use of the
		following words: Runcible, propitious, dolomphious, borascible,
		fizzgiggious, himmeltanious, tumble-dum-down, spongetaneous.
		</p>
		<p>
		4. Enumerate accurately all the animals who lived on the
		Quangle Wangle's Hat, and explain how the Quangle Wangle
		was enabled at once to enlighten his five travelling companions
		as to the true nature of the Co-operative Cauliflower.
		</p>
		<p>
		5. What were the names of the five daughters of the Old
		<a class="pagenumber" name="page022" id="page022" title="022"></a>
		Person of China, and what was the purpose for which the
		Old Man of the Dargle purchased six barrels of Gargle?
		</p>
		<p>
		6. Collect notices of King Xerxes in Mr. Lear's works, and
		state your theory, if you have any, as to the character and
		appearance of Nupiter Piffkin.
		</p>
		<p>
		7. Draw pictures of the Plum-pudding flea, and the Moppsikon
		Floppsikon Bear, and state by whom waterproof tubs
		were first used.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			8. "There was an old man at a station<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who made a promiscuous oration."<br />
		</p>
		<p>
		What bearing may we assume the foregoing couplet to have
		upon Mr. Lear's political views?&#8212;<i>The London Spectator</i>.

					<h3>THE STORY OF THE FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN WHO WENT ROUND THE WORLD.</h3>
					<p>
					Once upon a time, a long while ago, there were four little
					people whose names were<br />
					<br />
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/139.gif" alt="Violet, Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel;" />
					<br />
					and they all thought they should like to see the world. So they
					bought a large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, and then
					they were to come back on the other side by land. The boat was
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page122" id="page122" title="122"></a>
					painted blue with green spots, and the sail was yellow with red
					stripes: and, when they set off, they only took a small Cat to steer
					and look after the boat, besides an elderly Quangle-Wangle, who
					had to cook the dinner and make the tea; for which purposes they
					took a large kettle.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/140.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					For the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and found plenty
					to eat, as there were lots of fish; and they had only to take them
					out of the sea with a long spoon, when the Quangle-Wangle instantly
					cooked them; and the Pussy-Cat was fed with the bones,
					with which she expressed herself pleased, on the whole: so that all
					the party were very happy.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/141.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page123" id="page123" title="123"></a>
					<p>
					During the daytime, Violet chiefly occupied herself in putting
					salt water into a churn; while her three brothers churned it violently,
					in the hope that it would turn into butter, which it seldom
					if ever did; and in the evening they all retired into the tea-kettle,
					where they all managed to sleep very comfortably, while Pussy and
					the Quangle-Wangle managed the boat.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/142.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					After a time, they saw some land at a distance; and, when they
					came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded
					by earth. Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent
					isthmuses, with a great gulf-stream running about all over it; so
					that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree,
					503 feet high.
					</p>
					<p>
					<img src="images/143.gif" align="left" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." /><br />
					When they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their
					great surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and
					chocolate-drops, and nothing else. So they all climbed up the
					single high tree to discover, if possible, if there were any people;
					but having remained on the top of the tree for a week, and not
					seeing anybody, they naturally concluded that there were no inhabitants;
					and accordingly, when they came down, they loaded
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page124" id="page124" title="124"></a>
					the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets
					and a million of chocolate-drops;
					and these afforded
					them sustenance for more than
					a month, during which time
					they pursued their voyage with
					the utmost delight and apathy.
					</p>
					<p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/144.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World."/><br />
					After this they came to a
					shore where there were no less than sixty-five
					great red parrots with blue tails, sitting
					on a rail all of a row, and all fast asleep.
					And I am sorry to say that the Pussy-Cat
					and the Quangle-Wangle crept softly, and
					bit off the tail-feathers of all the sixty-five
					parrots; for which Violet reproved them
					both severely.
					</p>
					<p>
					Notwithstanding which, she proceeded
					to insert all the feathers&#8212;two hundred
					and sixty in number&#8212;in her bonnet;
					thereby causing it to have a lovely and
					glittering appearance, highly prepossessing
					and efficacious.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/145.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					The next thing that happened to them
					was in a narrow part of the sea, which was
					so entirely full of fishes that the boat could
					go on no farther: so they remained there
					about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly
					all the fishes, which were soles, and all
					ready-cooked, and covered with shrimp-sauce,
					so that there was no trouble whatever.
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page125" id="page125" title="125"></a>
					</p>
					<p>
					And as the few fishes who remained uneaten complained of
					the cold, as well as of the difficulty they had in getting any sleep on
					account of the extreme noise made by the arctic bears and the tropical
					turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood in great numbers,
					Violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for several of
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page126" id="page126" title="126"></a>
					the fishes, and Slingsby administered some opium-drops to them;
					through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/146.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					Then they came to a country which was wholly covered with
					immense orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of fruit. So they
					all landed, taking with them the tea-kettle, intending to gather some
					of the oranges, and place them in it. But, while they were busy
					about this, a most dreadfully high wind rose, and blew out most of
					the parrot-tail feathers from Violet's bonnet. That, however, was
					nothing compared with the calamity of the oranges falling down on
					their heads by millions and millions, which thumped and bumped
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page127" id="page127" title="127"></a>
					and bumped and thumped them all so seriously, that they were
					obliged to run as hard as they could for their lives; besides that
					the sound of the oranges rattling on the tea-kettle was of the most
					fearful and amazing nature.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/147.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					Nevertheless, they got safely to the boat, although considerably
					vexed and hurt; and the Quangle-Wangle's right foot was so
					knocked about, that he had to sit with his head in his slipper for
					at least a week.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/148.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." /><br />
					<p>
					This event made them all for a time rather melancholy: and perhaps
					they might never have become less so, had not Lionel, with a
					most praiseworthy devotion and perseverance, continued to stand
					on one leg,<br />
					and whistle to them in a loud and lively manner; which
					diverted the whole party so extremely
					that they gradually recovered
					their spirits, and agreed
					that whenever they should reach
					home, they would subscribe towards
					a testimonial to Lionel, entirely
					made of gingerbread and
					raspberries, as an earnest token of
					their sincere and grateful infection.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/149.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />

					<p>
					After sailing on calmly for
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page128" id="page128" title="128"></a>
					several more days, they came to another country, where they were
					much pleased and surprised to see a countless multitude of white
					Mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle, slowly eating
					custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite demeanor.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/150.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					And as the four travellers were rather hungry, being tired of eating
					nothing but soles and oranges for so long a period, they held
					a council as to the propriety of asking the Mice for some of their
					pudding in a humble and affecting manner, by which they could
					hardly be otherwise than gratified. It was agreed, therefore, that
					Guy should go and ask the Mice, which he immediately did; and
					the result was, that they gave a walnut-shell only half full of custard
					diluted with water. Now, this displeased Guy, who said, "Out of
					such a lot of pudding as you have got, I must say, you might have
					spared a somewhat larger quantity." But no sooner had he finished
					speaking than the Mice turned round at once, and sneezed at him
					in an appalling and vindictive manner (and it is impossible to
					imagine a more scroobious and unpleasant sound than that caused by
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page129" id="page129" title="129"></a>
					the simultaneous sneezing of many millions of angry Mice); so that
					Guy rushed back to the boat, having first shied his cap into the
					middle of the custard-pudding, by which means he completely
					spoiled the Mice's dinner.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/151.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					By and by the four children came to a country where there were
					no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large
					bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue
					color. Each of these blue bottles contained a Blue-Bottle-Fly; and
					all these interesting animals live continually together in the most
					copious and rural harmony: nor perhaps in many parts of the world
					is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. Violet and
					Slingsby and Guy and Lionel were greatly struck with this singular
					and instructive settlement; and, having previously asked permission
					of the Blue-Bottle-Flies (which was most courteously granted), the
					boat was drawn up to the shore, and they proceeded to make tea in
					front of the bottles: but as they had no tea-leaves, they merely
					placed some pebbles in the hot water; and the Quangle-Wangle
					played some tunes over it on an accordion, by which, of course, tea
					was made directly, and of the very best quality.
					</p>
				<img class="centeredimage" src="images/152.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					The four children then entered into conversation with the Blue-Bottle-Flies,
					who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page130" id="page130" title="130"></a>
					with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they
					each held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally
					occasioned a fizzy, extraneous utterance.
					</p>
					<p>
					"Why," said Violet, "would you kindly inform us, do you reside
					in bottles; and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple,
					or, indeed, in yellow bottles?"
					</p>
					<p>
					To which questions a very aged Blue-Bottle-Fly answered, "We
					found the bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our
					great-great-great-great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at
					once. And, when the winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside
					down, and consequently rarely feel the cold at all; and you know
					very well that this could not be the case with bottles of any other
					color than blue."
					</p>
					<p>
					"Of course it could not," said Slingsby. "But, if we may take
					the liberty of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?"
					</p>
					<p>
					"Mainly on oyster-patties," said the Blue-Bottle-Fly; "and,
					when these are scarce, on raspberry vinegar and Russian leather
					boiled down to a jelly."
					</p>
					<p>
					"How delicious!" said Guy.
					</p>
					<p>
					To which Lionel added, "Huzz!" And all the Blue-Bottle-Flies
					said, "Buzz!"
					</p>
					<p>
					At this time, an elderly Fly said it was the hour for the evening-song
					to be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the Blue-Bottle-Flies
					began to buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner,
					the melodious and mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters,
					and resounding across the tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice
					upon the intervening and verdant mountains with a serene and
					sickly suavity only known to the truly virtuous. The Moon was
					shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky, while her light
					irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of the
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page131" id="page131" title="131"></a>
					Blue-Bottle-Flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all
					Nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous
					circumstances.
					</p>
					<p>
					In many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to
					that evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was
					already past midnight when&#8212;the sail of the boat having been set
					up by the Quangle-Wangle, the tea-kettle and churn placed in their
					respective positions, and the Pussy-Cat stationed at the helm&#8212;the
					children each took a last and affectionate farewell of the Blue-Bottle-Flies,
					who walked down in a body to the water's edge to see the
					travellers embark.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/153.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					As a token of parting respect and esteem, Violet made a courtesy
					quite down to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining
					parrot-tail feathers into the back hair of the most pleasing of the
					Blue-Bottle-Flies; while Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel offered them
					three small boxes, containing, respectively, black pins, dried figs,
					and Epsom salts; and thus they left that happy shore forever.
					</p>
					<p>
					Overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly
					jumped into the tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. But all along
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page132" id="page132" title="132"></a>
					the shore, for many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of
					severely-suppressed sobs, and of a vague multitude of living creatures
					using their pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous
					snuffle, lingering sadly along the walloping waves as the boat sailed
					farther and farther away from the Land of the Happy Blue-Bottle-Flies.
					</p>
					<p>
					Nothing particular occurred for some days after these events,
					except that, as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they
					perceived an unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large
					number of Crabs and Crawfish&#8212;perhaps six or seven hundred&#8212;sitting
					by the water-side, and endeavoring to disentangle a vast
					heap of pale pink worsted, which they moistened at intervals with
					a fluid composed of lavender-water and white-wine negus.
					</p>
					<p>
					"Can we be of any service to you, O crusty Crabbies?" said the
					four children.
					</p>
					<p>
					"Thank you kindly," said the Crabs consecutively. "We are
					trying to make some worsted mittens, but do not know how."
					</p>
					<p>
					On which Violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of
					mitten-making, said to the Crabs, "Do your claws unscrew, or are
					they fixtures?"
					</p>
					<p>
					"They are all made to unscrew," said the Crabs; and forthwith
					they deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which
					Violet uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest
					mittens with it you can imagine. These the Crabs, having
					resumed and screwed on their claws, placed cheerfully upon their
					wrists, and walked away rapidly on their hind-legs, warbling songs
					with a silvery voice and in a minor key.
					</p>
					<p>
					After this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to
					a vast and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing
					whatever could be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page133" id="page133" title="133"></a>
					onward, there appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single
					object, which on a nearer approach, and on an accurately cutaneous
					inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig, sitting on
					an arm-chair made of sponge-cakes and oyster-shells. "It does not
					quite look like a human being," said Violet doubtfully; nor could
					they make out what it really was, till the Quangle-Wangle (who had
					previously been round the world) exclaimed softly in a loud voice,
					"It is the co-operative Cauliflower!"
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/154.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					And so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had
					taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the Cauliflower;
					and that he had no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with
					a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk,&#8212;an
					accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense of stockings
					and shoes.
					</p>
					<p>
					Presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at
					him with mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and,
					in a somewhat plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the
					setting sun,&#8212;his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential
					Cucumbers, and a large number of Waterwagtails proceeding
					in advance of him by three and three in a row,&#8212;till he finally
					disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of
					sudorific sand.
					</p>
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page134" id="page134" title="134"></a>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/155.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					So remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very
					deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong
					sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.
					</p>
					<p>
					Shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below
					some high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly
					odious little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers,
					and with a pewter plate upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin
					at the boat, by which it was instantly upset.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/156.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					But this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party
					knew how to swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page135" id="page135" title="135"></a>
					about till after the moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they
					sponge-taneously entered the boat. Meanwhile the Quangle-Wangle
					threw back the pumpkin with immense force, so that it hit the rocks
					where the malicious little boy in rose-colored knickerbockers was
					sitting; when, being quite full of lucifer-matches, the pumpkin
					exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits; whereon the rocks
					instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became unpleasantly
					hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were turned
					quite green, and his nose was burnt off.
					</p>
					<p>
					Two or three days after this had happened, they came to another
					place, where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep
					pits full of mulberry-jam. This is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed
					Apes who abound in these districts, and who store up the
					mulberry-jam for their food in winter, when they mix it with pellucid
					pale periwinkle-soup, and serve it out in wedgewood china-bowls,
					which grow freely all over that part of the country. Only
					one of the yellow-nosed Apes was on the spot, and he was fast
					asleep; yet the four travellers and the Quangle-Wangle and Pussy
					were so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring,
					that they merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned
					to re-embark in their boat without delay.
					</p>
					<p>
					What was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn
					and the tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous Seeze Pyder, an
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page136" id="page136" title="136"></a>
					aquatic and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and,
					happily, only met with in those excessive longitudes! In a moment,
					the beautiful boat was bitten into fifty-five thousand million hundred
					billion bits; and it instantly became quite clear that Violet, Slingsby,
					Guy, and Lionel could no longer preliminate their voyage by sea.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/157.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					The four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing
					their wanderings by land: and, very fortunately, there happened
					to pass by at that moment an elderly Rhinoceros, on which they
					seized; and, all four mounting on his back,&#8212;the Quangle-Wangle
					sitting on his horn, and holding on by his ears, and the Pussy-Cat
					swinging at the end of his tail,&#8212;they set off, having only four small
					beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes to last through their
					whole journey.
					</p>
					<img class="centeredimage" src="images/158.gif" alt="The Story of the Four Little Children who Went Round the World." />
					<p>
					They were, however, able to catch numbers of the chickens and
					turkeys and other birds who incessantly alighted on the head of the
					Rhinoceros for the purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew there; and these creatures they cooked in
					the most translucent and satisfactory manner by means of a fire
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page137" id="page137" title="137"></a>
					lighted on the end of the Rhinoceros's back. A crowd of Kangaroos
					and gigantic Cranes accompanied them, from feelings of curiosity
					and complacency; so that they were never at a loss for company,
					and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse and triumphant
					procession.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at
					home, where they were received by their admiring relatives with
					joy tempered with contempt, and where they finally resolved to
					carry out the rest of their travelling-plans at some more favorable
					opportunity.
					</p>
					<p>
					As for the Rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they
					had him killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside
					the door of their father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper.

						In former days,&#8212;that is to say, once upon a time,&#8212;there lived

						by the side of the great Lake Pipple-Popple (one of the seven
						families, indeed, lived <i>in</i> the lake), and on the outskirts of the city
						of Tosh, which, excepting when it was quite dark, they could see
						plainly. The names of all these places you have probably heard
						of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to
						find out all about them.

						<p class="chapterdescription">THE HABITS OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES.</p>
						<p>
						The Parrots lived upon the Soffsky-Poffsky trees, which were
						beautiful to behold, and covered with blue leaves; and they
						fed upon fruit, artichokes, and striped beetles.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Storks walked in and out of the Lake Pipple-Popple, and
						ate frogs for breakfast, and buttered toast for tea; but on account
						of the extreme length of their legs they could not sit down, and so
						they walked about continually.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies,
						which they ate for dinner.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Owls anxiously looked after mice, which they caught, and
						made into sago-puddings.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Guinea Pigs toddled about the gardens, and ate lettuces
						and Cheshire cheese.
						</p>
						<p>
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page142" id="page142" title="142"></a>
						The Cats sate still in the sunshine, and fed upon sponge biscuits.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Fishes lived in the lake, and fed chiefly on boiled periwinkles.
						</p>
						<p>
						And all these seven families lived together in the utmost fun and
						felicity.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="chapter" id="pipplechapter4">
						<p class="chapternumber">CHAPTER IV.</p>
						<p class="chapterdescription">THE CHILDREN OF THE SEVEN FAMILIES ARE SENT AWAY.</p>
						<p>
						One day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the
						seven families agreed that they would send their children
						out to see the world.
						</p>
						<p>
						So they called them all together, and gave them each eight
						shillings and some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small
						green morocco pocket-book to set down their expenses in.
						</p>
						<p>
						They then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all
						the parents sent off their children with a parting injunction.
						</p>
						<p>
						"If," said the old Parrots, "you find a cherry, do not fight
						about who should have it."
						</p>
						<p>
						"And," said the old Storks, "if you find a frog, divide it carefully
						into seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it."
						</p>
						<p>
						And the old Geese said to the seven young Geese, "Whatever
						you do, be sure you do not touch a plum-pudding flea."
						</p>
						<p>
						And the old Owls said, "If you find a mouse, tear him up into
						seven slices, and eat him cheerfully, but without quarrelling."
						</p>
						<p>
						And the old Guinea Pigs said, "Have a care that you eat your
						lettuces, should you find any, not greedily, but calmly."
						</p>
						<p>
						And the old Cats said, "Be particularly careful not to meddle
						with a clangle-wangle if you should see one."
						</p>
						<p>
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page143" id="page143" title="143"></a>
						And the old Fishes said, "Above all things, avoid eating a blue
						boss-woss; for they do not agree with fishes, and give them a pain
						in their toes."
						</p>
						<p>
						So all the children of each family thanked their parents; and,
						making in all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide
						world.

						<p>
						The seven young Parrots had not gone far, when they saw
						a tree with a single cherry on it, which the oldest Parrot
						picked instantly; but the other six, being extremely hungry, tried
						to get it also. On which all the seven began to fight; and they

						<p class="chapterdescription">THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG STORKS.</p>
						<p>
						When the seven young Storks set out, they walked or flew for
						fourteen weeks in a straight line, and for six weeks more in
						a crooked one; and after that they ran as hard as they could for
						one hundred and eight miles; and after that they stood still, and
						made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery noise with their bills.
						</p>
						<p>
						About the same time they perceived a large frog, spotted with
						green, and with a sky-blue stripe under each ear.
						</p>
						<p>
						So, being hungry, they immediately flew at him, and were going
						to divide him into seven pieces, when they began to quarrel as to
						which of his legs should be taken off first. One said this, and
						another said that; and while they were all quarrelling, the frog
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page145" id="page145" title="145"></a>
						hopped away. And when they saw that he was gone, they began
						to chatter-clatter,<br />
						<span class="i7">blatter-platter,</span>
						<span class="i9">patter-blatter,</span>
						<span class="i11">matter-clatter,</span>
						<span class="i13">flatter-quatter,</span>
						more violently than ever; and after they
						had fought for a week, they pecked each other all to little pieces,
						so that at last nothing was left of any of them except their bills.
						</p>
						<p>
						And that was the end of the seven young Storks.

						<p class="chapternumber">CHAPTER VII.</p>
						<p class="chapterdescription">THE HISTORY OF THE SEVEN YOUNG GEESE.</p>
						<p>
						When the seven young Geese began to travel, they went over
						a large plain, on which there was but one tree, and that was,
						a very bad one.
						</p>
						<p>
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page146" id="page146" title="146"></a>
						</p>
						<p>
						So four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about
						them; while the other three waddled up and down, and repeated
						poetry, and their last six lessons in arithmetic, geography, and
						cookery.
						</p>
						<p>
						Presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most
						interesting and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body
						exactly resembling a boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and
						a beak, and three feathers growing out of his head, and only one
						leg.
						</p>
						<p>
						So, after a time, all the seven young Geese said to each
						other, "Beyond all doubt this beast must be a Plum-pudding
						Flea!"
						</p>
						<p>
						On which they incautiously began to sing aloud,
						</p>
						<blockquote>
						<span class="i12">"Plum-pudding Flea,</span>
						<span class="i12">Plum-pudding Flea,</span>
						<span class="i12">Wherever you be,</span>
						<span class="i12">Oh! come to our tree,</span>
						<span class="i8">And listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!"</span>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
						And no sooner had they sung this verse than the Plum-pudding
						Flea began to hop and skip on his one leg with the
						most dreadful velocity, and came straight to the tree, where he
						stopped, and looked about him in a vacant and voluminous
						manner.
						</p>
						<p>
						On which the seven young Geese were greatly alarmed, and all
						of a tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and
						just touched him with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he
						done this than the Plum-pudding Flea skipped and hopped about
						more and more, and higher and higher; after which he opened
						his mouth, and, to the great surprise and indignation of the seven
						Geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and terribly, that
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page147" id="page147" title="147"></a>
						they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees every
						one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.
						</p>
						<p>
						So that was the end of the seven young Geese.

						<p>
						When the seven young Owls set out, they sate every now and
						then on the branches of old trees, and never went far at
						one time.
						</p>
						<p>
						And one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard
						a mouse; but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not
						see him.
						</p>
						<p>
						So they called out, "Is that a mouse?"
						</p>
						<p>
						On which a mouse answered, "Squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!"
						</p>
						<p>
						And immediately all the young Owls threw themselves off the
						tree, meaning to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive
						that there was a large well below them, into which they all fell superficially,
						<a class="pagenumber" name="page148" id="page148" title="148"></a>
						and were every one of them drowned in less than half a

						asleep. When they awoke, they saw a large lettuce, which had
						grown out of the ground while they had been sleeping, and which
						had an immense number of green leaves. At which they all
						exclaimed,&#8212;

						<blockquote>
						"Lettuce! O lettuce<br />

						And instantly the seven young Guinea Pigs rushed with such extreme
						force against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly
						against its stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient

						The seven young Cats set off on their travels with great delight
						and rapacity. But, on coming to the top of a high hill, they
						perceived at a long distance off a Clangle-Wangle (or, as it is more
						properly written, Clangel-Wangel); and, in spite of the warning
						they had had, they ran straight up to it.
						</p>
						<p>
						(Now, the Clangle-Wangle is a most dangerous and delusive
						beast, and by no means commonly to be met with. They live in
						the water as well as on land, using their long tail as a sail when in
						the former element. Their speed is extreme; but their habits of
						life are domestic and superfluous, and their general demeanor pensive
										<a class="pagenumber" name="page150" id="page150" title="150"></a>
						and pellucid. On summer evenings, they may sometimes be
						observed near the Lake Pipple-Popple, standing on their heads, and
						humming their national melodies. They subsist entirely on vegetables,
						excepting when they eat veal or mutton or pork or beef or
						fish or saltpetre.)
						</p>
						<p>
						The moment the Clangle-Wangle saw the seven young Cats approach,
						he ran away; and as he ran straight on for four months,
						and the Cats, though they continued to run, could never overtake

						afterwards recovered.

				<blockquote>
				"Our readers will be interested in the following communications
				from our valued and learned contributor, Prof. Bosh,
				whose labors in the fields of culinary and botanical science are so
				well known to all the world. The first three articles richly merit
				to be added to the domestic cookery of every family: those which
				follow claim the attention of all botanists; and we are happy to
				be able, through Dr. Bosh's kindness, to present our readers with
				illustrations of his discoveries. All the new flowers are found in
				the Valley of Verrikwier, near the Lake of Oddgrow, and on the
				summit of the Hill Orfeltugg."

				<h3>THREE RECEIPTS FOR DOMESTIC COOKERY.</h3>
				<hr />
				<div class="recipe" id="cook1">
					<h4>TO MAKE AN AMBLONGUS PIE.</h4>
					<p>
					Take 4 pounds (say 4&#189; pounds) of fresh Amblongusses, and
					put them in a small pipkin.
					</p>
					<p>
					Cover them with water, and boil them for 8 hours incessantly;
					after which add 2 pints of new milk, and proceed to boil for 4
					hours more.
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page157" id="page157" title="157"></a>						</p>
					<p>
					When you have ascertained that the Amblongusses are quite
					soft, take them out, and place them in a wide pan, taking care to
					shake them well previously.
					</p>
					<p>
					Grate some nutmeg over the surface, and cover them carefully
					with powdered gingerbread, curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity
					of Cayenne pepper.
					</p>
					<p>
					Remove the pan into the next room, and place it on the floor.
					Bring it back again, and let it simmer for three-quarters of an hour.
					Shake the pan violently till all the Amblongusses have become of a
					pale purple color.
					</p>
					<p>
					Then, having prepared the paste, insert the whole carefully;
					adding at the same time a small pigeon, 2 slices of beef, 4 cauliflowers,
					and any number of oysters.
					</p>
					<p>
					Watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of
					salt from time to time.
					</p>
					<p>
					Serve up in a clean dish, and throw the whole out of window
					as fast as possible.
					</p>
				</div>
				<hr />
				<div class="recipe" id="cook2">
					<h4>TO MAKE CRUMBOBBLIOUS CUTLETS.</h4>
					<p>
					Procure some strips of beef, and, having cut them into the
					smallest possible slices, proceed to cut them still smaller,&#8212;
					eight, or perhaps nine times.
					</p>
					<p>
					When the whole is thus minced, brush it up hastily with a new
					clothes-brush, and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon
					or a soup-ladle.
					</p>
					<p>
					Place the whole in a saucepan, and remove it to a sunny place,
					&#8212;say the roof of the house, if free from sparrows or other birds,&#8212;
					and leave it there for about a week.
					<a class="pagenumber" name="page158" id="page158" title="158"></a>
					</p>
					<p>
					At the end of that time add a little lavender, some oil of almonds,
					and a few herring-bones; and then cover the whole with
					4 gallons of clarified Crumbobblious sauce, when it will be ready
					for use.
					</p>
					<p>
					Cut it into the shape of ordinary cutlets, and serve up in a clean
					table-cloth or dinner-napkin.
					</p>
				</div>
				<hr />
				<div class="recipe" id="cook3">
					<h4>TO MAKE GOSKY PATTIES.</h4>
					<p>
					Take a pig three or four years of age, and tie him by the off
					hind-leg to a post. Place 5 pounds of currants, 3 of sugar, 2
					pecks of peas, 18 roast chestnuts, a candle, and 6 bushels of turnips,
					within his reach: if he eats these, constantly provide him
					with more.
					</p>
					<p>
					Then procure some cream, some slices of Cheshire cheese, 4
					quires of foolscap paper, and a packet of black pins. Work the
					whole into a paste, and spread it out to dry on a sheet of clean
					brown waterproof linen.
					</p>
					<p>
					When the paste is perfectly dry, but not before, proceed to beat
					the pig violently with the handle of a large broom. If he squeals,
					beat him again.
					</p>
					<p>
					Visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days, and
					ascertain if, at the end of that period, the whole is about to turn
					into Gosky Patties.
					</p>
					<p>
					If it does not then, it never will; and in that case the pig
					may be let loose, and the whole process may be considered as
					finished.
					</p>

		INTRODUCTION.

		<hr />
		<img src="images/265.gif" alt="Edward Lear Self-Portrait" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20" /><p>
		In offering this little book&#8212;the third of its kind&#8212;to
		the public, I am glad to take the opportunity
		of recording the pleasure I have received at the appreciation
		its predecessors have met with, as attested
		by their wide circulation, and by the universally kind
		notices of them from the Press. To have been the
		means of administering innocent mirth to thousands,
		may surely be a just motive for satisfaction, and an
		excuse for grateful expression.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the same time, I am desirous of adding a few
		words as to the history of the two previously published
		<a class="pagenumber" name="page241" id="page241" title="241"></a>
		volumes, and more particularly of the first or
		original "Book of Nonsense," relating to which many
		absurd reports have crept into circulation, such as that
		it was the composition of the late Lord Brougham, the
		late Earl of Derby, etc.; that the rhymes and pictures
		are by different persons; or that the whole have a
		symbolical meaning, etc.; whereas, every one of the
		Rhymes was composed by myself, and every one of
		the Illustrations drawn by my own hand at the time
		the verses were made. Moreover, in no portion of
		these Nonsense drawings have I ever allowed any caricature
		of private or public persons to appear, and
		throughout, more care than might be supposed has
		been given to make the subjects incapable of misinterpretation:
		"Nonsense," pure and absolute, having
		been my aim throughout.
		</p>
		<p>
		As for the persistently absurd report of the late Earl
		of Derby being the author of the "First Book of Nonsense,"
		I may relate an incident which occurred to me
		four summers ago, the first that gave me any insight
		into the origin of the rumor.
		</p>
		<p>
		I was on my way from London to Guildford, in a
		railway carriage, containing, besides myself, one passenger,
		an elderly gentleman: presently, however, two
		ladies entered, accompanied by two little boys. These,
		who had just had a copy of the "Book of Nonsense"
		given them, were loud in their delight, and by degrees
		infected the whole party with their mirth.
		</p>
		<p>
		"How grateful," said the old gentleman to the two
		<a class="pagenumber" name="page242" id="page242" title="242"></a>
		ladies, "all children, and parents too, ought to be to
		the statesman who has given his time to composing
		that charming book!"
		</p>
		<p>
		(The ladies looked puzzled, as indeed was I, the
		author.)
		</p>
		<p>
		"Do you not know who is the writer of it?" asked
		the gentleman.
		</p>
		<p>
		"The name is 'Edward Lear,'" said one of the
		ladies.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Ah!" said the first speaker, "so it is printed; but
		that is only a whim of the real author, the Earl of
		Derby. 'Edward' is his Christian name, and, as you
		may see, LEAR is only EARL transposed."
		</p>
		<p>
		"But," said the lady, doubtingly, "here is a dedication
		to the great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and
		grand-nieces of Edward, thirteenth Earl of Derby, by
		the author, Edward Lear."
		</p>
		<p>
		"That," replied the other, "is simply a piece of
		mystification; I am in a position to know that the
		whole book was composed and illustrated by Lord
		Derby himself. In fact, there is no such a person at
		all as Edward Lear."
		</p>
		<p>
		"Yet," said the other lady, "some friends of mine
		tell me they know Mr. Lear."
		</p>
		<p>
		"Quite a mistake! completely a mistake!" said the
		old gentleman, becoming rather angry at the contradiction;
		"I am well aware of what I am saying: I
		can inform you, no such a person as 'Edward Lear'
		exists!"
		</p>
		<p>
		<a class="pagenumber" name="page243" id="page243" title="243"></a>

		Hitherto I had kept silence; but as my hat was, as
		well as my handkerchief and stick, largely marked inside
		with my name, and as I happened to have in my
		pocket several letters addressed to me, the temptation
		was too great to resist; so, flashing all these articles at
		once on my would-be extinguisher's attention, I speedily
		reduced him to silence.
		</p>
		<p>
		The second volume of Nonsense, commencing with
		the verses, "The Owl and the Pussy-Cat," was written
		at different times, and for different sets of children:
		the whole being collected in the course of last year,
		were then illustrated, and published in a single volume,
		by Mr. R.J. Bush, of 32 Charing Cross.
		</p>
		<p>
		The contents of the third or present volume were
		made also at different intervals in the last two years.
		</p>
		<p>
		Long years ago, in days when much of my time
		was passed in a country house, where children and
		mirth abounded, the lines beginning, "There was an
		old man of Tobago," were suggested to me by a valued
		friend, as a form of verse lending itself to limitless
		variety for rhymes and pictures; and thenceforth the
		greater part of the original drawings and verses for
		the first "Book of Nonsense" were struck off with
		a pen, no assistance ever having been given me in any

		Most of these Drawings and Rhymes were transferred
		to lithographic stones in the year 1846, and
		were then first published by Mr. Thomas McLean, of
		<a class="pagenumber" name="page244" id="page244" title="244"></a>
		the Haymarket. But that edition having been soon
		exhausted, and the call for the "Book of Nonsense"
		continuing, I added a considerable number of subjects
		to those previously-published, and having caused the
		whole to be carefully reproduced in woodcuts by
		Messrs. Dalzell, I disposed of the copyright to Messrs.
		Routledge and Warne, by whom the volume was
		published in 1843.

				<h3>THE DONG WITH A LUMINOUS NOSE.</h3>
				<p>
				<span class="largecap">W</span>hen awful darkness and silence reign<br />
				Over the great Gromboolian plain,<br />
				<span class="i2">Through the long, long wintry nights;</span>
				When the angry breakers roar<br />
				As they beat on the rocky shore;<br />
				<span class="i2">When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights</span>
				Of the Hills of the Chankly Bore,&#8212;
				</p>
				<p>
				Then, through the vast and gloomy dark<br />
				There moves what seems a fiery spark,&#8212;<br />
				<span class="i2">A lonely spark with silvery rays</span>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page342" id="page342" title="342"></a>
				<span class="i4">Piercing the coal-black night,&#8212;</span>
				<span class="i4">A Meteor strange and bright:</span>
				<span class="i2">Hither and thither the vision strays,</span>
				<span class="i4">A single lurid light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				Slowly it wanders, pauses, creeps,&#8212;<br />
				Anon it sparkles, flashes, and leaps;<br />
				And ever as onward it gleaming goes<br />
				A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.<br />
				And those who watch at that midnight hour<br />
				From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,<br />
				Cry, as the wild light passes along,&#8212;<br />
				<span class="i4">"The Dong! the Dong!</span>
				<span class="i2">The wandering Dong through the forest goes!</span>
				<span class="i4">The Dong! the Dong!</span>
				<span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="i4">Long years ago</span>
				<span class="i2">The Dong was happy and gay,</span>
				Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl<br />
				<span class="i2">Who came to those shores one day.</span>
				For the Jumblies came in a sieve, they did,&#8212;<br />
				Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd<br />
				<span class="i4">Where the Oblong Oysters grow,</span>
				<span class="i2">And the rocks are smooth and gray.</span>
				And all the woods and the valleys rang<br />
				With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang,&#8212;<br />
				<i><span class="i6">"Far and few, far and few,</span>
				<span class="i6">Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</span>
				<span class="i6">Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</span>
				<span class="i6">And they went to sea in a sieve."</span></i>
				</p>
				<p>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page343" id="page343" title="343"></a>
				Happily, happily passed those days!<br />
				<span class="i8">While the cheerful Jumblies staid;</span>
				<span class="i4">They danced in circlets all night long,</span>
				<span class="i4">To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong,</span>
				<span class="i8">In moonlight, shine, or shade.</span>
				For day and night he was always there<br />
				By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair,<br />
				With her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;<br />
				Till the morning came of that hateful day<br />
				When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away,<br />
				And the Dong was left on the cruel shore<br />
				Gazing, gazing for evermore,&#8212;<br />
				Ever keeping his weary eyes on<br />
				That pea-green sail on the far horizon,&#8212;<br />
				Singing the Jumbly Chorus still<br />
				As he sate all day on the grassy hill,&#8212;<br />
				<i><span class="i10">"Far and few, far and few,</span>
				<span class="i10">Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</span>
				<span class="i10">Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</span>
				<span class="i10">And they went to sea in a sieve."</span></i>
				</p>
				<p>
				But when the sun was low in the West,<br />
				<span class="i4">The Dong arose and said,&#8212;</span>
				&#8212;"What little sense I once possessed<br />
				<span class="i4">Has quite gone out of my head!"</span>
				And since that day he wanders still<br />
				By lake and forest, marsh and hill,<br />
				Singing, "O somewhere, in valley or plain,<br />
				Might I find my Jumbly Girl again!<br />
				For ever I'll seek by lake and shore<br />
				Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more!"
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page344" id="page344" title="344"></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="i2">Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,</span>
				<span class="i2">Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks;</span>
				<span class="i2">And because by night he could not see,</span>
				<span class="i2">He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree</span>
				<span class="i4">On the flowery plain that grows.</span>
				<span class="i4">And he wove him a wondrous Nose,&#8212;</span>
				<span class="i2">A Nose as strange as a Nose could be!</span>
				Of vast proportions and painted red,<br />
				And tied with cords to the back of his head.<br />
				<span class="i2">&#8212;In a hollow rounded space it ended</span>
				<span class="i2">With a luminous Lamp within suspended,</span>
				<span class="i4">All fenced about</span>
				<span class="i4">With a bandage stout</span>
				<span class="i4">To prevent the wind from blowing it out;</span>
				<span class="i2">And with holes all round to send the light</span>
				<span class="i2">In gleaming rays on the dismal night</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				And now each night, and all night long,<br />
				Over those plains still roams the Dong;<br />
				And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe<br />
				You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,<br />
				While ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,<br />
				To meet with his Jumbly Girl again;<br />
				Lonely and wild, all night he goes,&#8212;<br />
				The Dong with a luminous Nose!<br />
				And all who watch at the midnight hour,<br />
				From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,<br />
				Cry, as they trace the Meteor bright,<br />
				Moving along through the dreary night,&#8212;<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page345" id="page345" title="345"></a>

				<h3>
				THE TWO OLD BACHELORS.
				</h3>
				<p>
				<span class="largecap">T</span>wo old Bachelors were living in one house;<br />
				One caught a Muffin, the other caught a Mouse.<br />
				Said he who caught the Muffin to him who caught the Mouse,&#8212;<br />
				"This happens just in time! For we've nothing in the house,<br />
				Save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey,<br />
				And what to do for dinner&#8212;since we haven't any money?<br />
				And what can we expect if we haven't any dinner,<br />
				But to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?"
				</p>
				<p>
				Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin,&#8212;<br />
				"We might cook this little Mouse, if we only had some Stuffin'!<br />
				If we had but Sage and Onion we could do extremely well;<br />
				But how to get that Stuffin' it is difficult to tell!"
				</p>
				<p>
				Those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town<br />
				And asked for Sage and Onion as they wandered up and down;<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page347" id="page347" title="347"></a>
				They borrowed two large Onions, but no Sage was to be found<br />
				In the Shops, or in the Market, or in all the Gardens round.
				</p>
				<p>
				But some one said, "A hill there is, a little to the north,<br />
				And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth;<br />
				And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage,&#8212;<br />
				An earnest Man, who reads all day a most perplexing page.<br />
				Climb up, and seize him by the toes,&#8212;all studious as he sits,&#8212;<br />
				And pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits!<br />
				Then mix him with your Onion (cut up likewise into Scraps),&#8212;<br />
				When your Stuffin' will be ready, and very good&#8212;perhaps."
				</p>
				<p>
				Those two old Bachelors without loss of time<br />
				The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb;<br />
				And at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook,<br />
				They saw that Sage a-reading of a most enormous book.
				</p>
				<p>
				"You earnest Sage!" aloud they cried, "your book you've read enough in!<br />
				We wish to chop you into bits to mix you into Stuffin'!"
				</p>
				<p>
				But that old Sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book,<br />
				At those two Bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took;<br />
				And over Crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,&#8212;<br />
				At once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town;<br />
				And when they reached their house, they found (besides their want of Stuffin'),<br />
				The Mouse had fled&#8212;and, previously, had eaten up the Muffin.
				</p>
				<p>
				They left their home in silence by the once convivial door;<br />
				And from that hour those Bachelors were never heard of more.

				<span class="largecap">K</span>ing and Queen of the Pelicans we;<br />
				No other Birds so grand we see!<br />
				None but we have feet like fins!<br />
				With lovely leathery throats and chins!<br />
				<span class="i2">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
				<span class="i2">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
				<span class="i2">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican Jill!</span>
				<span class="i2">We think so then, and we thought so still</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				We live on the Nile. The Nile we love.<br />
				By night we sleep on the cliffs above;<br />
				By day we fish, and at eve we stand<br />
				On long bare islands of yellow sand.<br />
				And when the sun sinks slowly down,<br />
				And the great rock walls grow dark and brown,<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page350" id="page350" title="350"></a>
				Where the purple river rolls fast and dim<br />
				And the Ivory Ibis starlike skim,<br />
				Wing to wing we dance around,<br />
				Stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,<br />
				Opening our mouths as Pelicans ought;<br />
				And this is the song we nightly snort,&#8212;<br />
				<span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
				<span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				Last year came out our Daughter Dell,<br />
				And all the Birds received her well.<br />
				To do her honor a feast we made<br />
				For every bird that can swim or wade,&#8212;<br />
				Herons and Gulls, and Cormorants black,<br />
				Cranes, and Flamingoes with scarlet back,<br />
				Plovers and Storks, and Geese in clouds,<br />
				Swans and Dilberry Ducks in crowds:<br />
				Thousands of Birds in wondrous flight!<br />
				They ate and drank and danced all night,<br />
				And echoing back from the rocks you heard<br />
				Multitude-echoes from Bird and Bird,&#8212;<br />
				<span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
				<span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				Yes, they came; and among the rest<br />
				The King of the Cranes all grandly dressed.<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page351" id="page351" title="351"></a>
				Such a lovely tail! Its feathers float<br />
				Between the ends of his blue dress-coat;<br />
				With pea-green trowsers all so neat,<br />
				And a delicate frill to hide his feet<br />
				(For though no one speaks of it, every one knows<br />
				He has got no webs between his toes).<br />
				</p>
				<p>
				As soon as he saw our Daughter Dell,<br />
				In violent love that Crane King fell,&#8212;<br />
				On seeing her waddling form so fair,<br />
				With a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.<br />
				And before the end of the next long day<br />
				Our Dell had given her heart away;<br />
				For the King of the Cranes had won that heart<br />
				With a Crocodile's egg and a large fish-tart.<br />
				She vowed to marry the King of the Cranes,<br />
				Leaving the Nile for stranger plains;<br />
				And away they flew in a gathering crowd<br />
				Of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.<br />
				<span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
				<span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				And far away in the twilight sky<br />
				We heard them singing a lessening cry,&#8212;<br />
				Farther and farther, till out of sight,<br />
				And we stood alone in the silent night!<br />
				Often since, in the nights of June,<br />
				We sit on the sand and watch the moon,&#8212;<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page352" id="page352" title="352"></a>
				She has gone to the great Gromboolian Plain,<br />
				And we probably never shall meet again!<br />
				Oft, in the long still nights of June,<br />
				We sit on the rocks and watch the moon,&#8212;<br />
				She dwells by the streams of the Chankly Bore.<br />
				And we probably never shall see her more.<br />
				<span class="i2">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>

				By way of a hat he'd a loaf of Brown Bread,<br />
				In the middle of which he inserted his head;<br />
				His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice,<br />
				The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;<br />
				His Drawers were of Rabbit-skins, so were his Shoes;<br />
				His Stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;<br />
				His Waistcoat and Trowsers were made of Pork Chops;<br />
				His Buttons were Jujubes and Chocolate Drops;<br />
				His Coat was all Pancakes, with Jam for a border,<br />
				And a girdle of Biscuits to keep it in order;<br />
				And he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,<br />
				A Cloak of green Cabbage-leaves stitched all together.

				He had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,<br />
				Of all sorts of Beasticles, Birdlings, and Boys;<br />

				Pork Waistcoat and Trowsers to give to their Puppies;<br />
				And while they were growling, and mumbling the Chops,<br />
				Ten Boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.<br />
				He tried to run back to his house, but in vain,<br />
				For scores of fat Pigs came again and again:<br />
				They rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;<br />
				They tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;<br />
				And now from the housetops with screechings descend<br />
				Striped, spotted, white, black, and gray Cats without end:<br />
				They jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,<br />
				When Crows, Ducks, and Hens made a mincemeat of that;<br />
				They speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,<br />
				And utterly tore up his Shirt of dead Mice;<br />
				They swallowed the last of his Shirt with a squall,&#8212;<br />
				Whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.

				<p class="versenumber">	III.</p>

				Mr. Discobbolos answered,<br />

				And at night by the light of the Mulberry moon<br />

				They nailed her Dobie to the wall,

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
