<p id="id00014" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id00015" style="margin-top: 2em">We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.</p>

<p id="id00016">Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.</p>

<p id="id00017" style="margin-top: 2em">Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p id="id00018">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.</p>

<p id="id00019">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.</p>

<p id="id00020">At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.</p>

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.</p>

<p id="id00037">*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.</p>

<p id="id00038">ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.</p>

<p id="id00039">To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p id="id00040">LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p id="id00041">If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.</p>

<p id="id00054" style="margin-top: 5em">Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie of Othello,
the Moore of Venice</p>

<p id="id00055" style="margin-top: 4em">Executive Director's Notes:</p>

<p id="id00056">In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
are presented herein:</p>

<p id="id00057">  Barnardo. Who's there?<br/>

  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand &amp; vnfold<br/>

your selfe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00058">   Bar. Long liue the King</p>

<p id="id00059">***</p>

<p id="id00060">As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .</p>

<p id="id00061">The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.</p>

<p id="id00062">You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
for signing his name with several different spellings.</p>

<p id="id00063">So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
that are "not" errors. . . .</p>

<p id="id00064">So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie
of Othello, the Moore of Venice.</p>

<p id="id00067" style="margin-top: 2em">Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text.</p>

<p id="id00068">The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare.</p>

<p id="id00069">Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions' best pages.</p>

<p id="id00070">If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.</p>

  Iago. Sir, y'are rob'd, for shame put on your Gowne,<br/>

Your heart is burst, you haue lost halfe your soule<br/>

Euen now, now, very now, an old blacke Ram<br/>

Is tupping your white Ewe. Arise, arise,<br/>

Awake the snorting Cittizens with the Bell,<br/>

Or else the deuill will make a Grand-sire of you.<br/>

Arise I say<br/>

<p id="id00088">   Bra. What, haue you lost your wits?<br/>

<p id="id00089">   Bra. The worsser welcome:<br/>

I haue charg'd thee not to haunt about my doores:<br/>

In honest plainenesse thou hast heard me say,<br/>

My Daughter is not for thee. And now in madnesse<br/>

(Being full of Supper, and distempring draughtes)<br/>

Vpon malitious knauerie, dost thou come<br/>

To start my quiet<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00090">   Rod. Sir, Sir, Sir</p>

<p id="id00091">   Bra. But thou must needs be sure,<br/>

My spirits and my place haue in their power<br/>

To make this bitter to thee<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00092">   Rodo. Patience good Sir</p>

<p id="id00093">   Bra. What tell'st thou me of Robbing?<br/>

This is Venice: my house is not a Grange<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00094">   Rodo. Most graue Brabantio,<br/>

In simple and pure soule, I come to you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00095">   Ia. Sir: you are one of those that will not serue God,
if the deuill bid you. Because we come to do you seruice,
and you thinke we are Ruffians, you'le haue your Daughter
couer'd with a Barbary horse, you'le haue your Nephewes
neigh to you, you'le haue Coursers for Cozens:
and Gennets for Germaines</p>

<p id="id00096">   Bra. What prophane wretch art thou?<br/>

  Ia. I am one Sir, that comes to tell you, your Daughter<br/>

and the Moore, are making the Beast with two backs<br/>

<p id="id00097">   Bra. Thou art a Villaine</p>

<p id="id00098">   Iago. You are a Senator</p>

<p id="id00099">   Bra. This thou shalt answere. I know thee Rodorigo</p>

<p id="id00100">   Rod. Sir, I will answere any thing. But I beseech you<br/>

If't be your pleasure, and most wise consent,<br/>

(As partly I find it is) that your faire Daughter,<br/>

At this odde Euen and dull watch o'th' night<br/>

Transported with no worse nor better guard,<br/>

But with a knaue of common hire, a Gundelier,<br/>

To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore:<br/>

If this be knowne to you, and your Allowance,<br/>

We then haue done you bold, and saucie wrongs.<br/>

But if you know not this, my Manners tell me,<br/>

We haue your wrong rebuke. Do not beleeue<br/>

That from the sence of all Ciuilitie,<br/>

I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence.<br/>

Your Daughter (if you haue not giuen her leaue)<br/>

I say againe, hath made a grosse reuolt,<br/>

Tying her Dutie, Beautie, Wit, and Fortunes<br/>

In an extrauagant, and wheeling Stranger,<br/>

Of here, and euery where: straight satisfie your selfe.<br/>

If she be in her Chamber, or your house,<br/>

Let loose on me the Iustice of the State<br/>

For thus deluding you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00101">   Bra. Strike on the Tinder, hoa:<br/>

Giue me a Taper: call vp all my people,<br/>

This Accident is not vnlike my dreame,<br/>

Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie.<br/>

Light, I say, light.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00102">  Iag. Farewell: for I must leaue you.<br/>

It seemes not meete, nor wholesome to my place<br/>

To be producted, (as if I stay, I shall,)<br/>

Against the Moore. For I do know the State,<br/>

(How euer this may gall him with some checke)<br/>

Cannot with safetie cast-him. For he's embark'd<br/>

With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres,<br/>

(Which euen now stands in Act) that for their soules<br/>

Another of his Fadome, they haue none,<br/>

To lead their Businesse. In which regard,<br/>

Though I do hate him as I do hell paines,<br/>

Yet, for necessitie of present life,<br/>

I must show out a Flag, and signe of Loue,<br/>

(Which is indeed but signe) that you shal surely find him<br/>

Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search:<br/>

And there will I be with him. So farewell.<br/>

With the Moore saist thou? (Who would be a Father?)<br/>

How didst thou know 'twas she? (Oh she deceaues me<br/>

Oh treason of the blood.<br/>

Fathers, from hence trust not your Daughters minds<br/>

By which the propertie of Youth, and Maidhood<br/>

May be abus'd? Haue you not read Rodorigo,<br/>

Of some such thing?<br/>

  Rod. Yes Sir: I haue indeed<br/>

Whether a Maid, so tender, Faire, and Happie,<br/>

So opposite to Marriage, that she shun'd<br/>

The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation,<br/>

Would euer haue (t' encurre a generall mocke)<br/>

Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome,<br/>

Of such a thing as thou: to feare, not to delight?<br/>

Iudge me the world, if 'tis not grosse in sense,<br/>

That thou hast practis'd on her with foule Charmes,<br/>

Abus'd her delicate Youth, with Drugs or Minerals,<br/>

That weakens Motion. Ile haue't disputed on,<br/>

'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking;<br/>

I therefore apprehend and do attach thee,<br/>

  1.Sen. This cannot be<br/>

Th' importancie of Cyprus to the Turke;<br/>

And let our selues againe but vnderstand,<br/>

That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes,<br/>

So may he with more facile question beare it,<br/>

For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace,<br/>

But altogether lackes th' abilities<br/>

That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,<br/>

We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull,<br/>

To leaue that latest, which concernes him first,<br/>

Neglecting an attempt of ease, and gaine<br/>

Neither my place, nor ought I heard of businesse<br/>

Hath rais'd me from my bed; nor doth the generall care<br/>

Take hold on me. For my perticular griefe<br/>

Is of so flood-gate, and ore-bearing Nature,<br/>

That it engluts, and swallowes other sorrowes,<br/>

And it is still it selfe<br/>

My very Noble, and approu'd good Masters;<br/>

That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter,<br/>

It is most true: true I haue married her;<br/>

The verie head, and front of my offending,<br/>

Hath this extent; no more. Rude am I, in my speech,<br/>

And little bless'd with the soft phrase of Peace;<br/>

For since these Armes of mine, had seuen yeares pith,<br/>

Till now, some nine Moones wasted, they haue vs'd<br/>

Their deerest action, in the Tented Field:<br/>

And little of this great world can I speake,<br/>

More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles, and Battaile,<br/>

And therefore little shall I grace my cause,<br/>

In speaking for my selfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience)<br/>

I will a round vn-varnish'd Tale deliuer,<br/>

Of my whole course of Loue.<br/>

What Drugges, what Charmes,<br/>

What Coniuration, and what mighty Magicke,<br/>

(For such proceeding I am charg'd withall)<br/>

Blush'd at her selfe, and she, in spight of Nature,<br/>

Of Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing<br/>

To fall in Loue, with what she fear'd to looke on;<br/>

It is a iudgement main'd, and most imperfect.<br/>

That will confesse Perfection so could erre<br/>

Against all rules of Nature, and must be driuen<br/>

To find out practises of cunning hell<br/>

Why this should be. I therefore vouch againe,<br/>

That with some Mixtures, powrefull o're the blood,<br/>

Or with some Dram, (coniur'd to this effect)<br/>

He wrought vpon her.<br/>

To vouch this, is no proofe,<br/>

Without more wider, and more ouer Test<br/>

Of moderne seeming, do prefer against him<br/>

Subdue, and poyson this yong Maides affections?<br/>

  Othel. I do beseech you,<br/>

Send for the Lady to the Sagitary,<br/>

And let her speake of me before her Father;<br/>

<p id="id00173">   Duke. Say it Othello</p>

<p id="id00174">   Othe. Her Father lou'd me, oft inuited me:<br/>

Still question'd me the Storie of my life,<br/>

From yeare to yeare: the Battaile, Sieges, Fortune,<br/>

That I haue past.<br/>

I ran it through, euen from my boyish daies,<br/>

Toth' very moment that he bad me tell it.<br/>

Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:<br/>

Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field,<br/>

Of haire-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;<br/>

Of being taken by the Insolent Foe,<br/>

And sold to slauery. Of my redemption thence,<br/>

And portance in my Trauellours historie.<br/>

Wherein of Antars vast, and Desarts idle,<br/>

Rough Quarries, Rocks, Hills, whose head touch heauen,<br/>

It was my hint to speake. Such was my Processe,<br/>

And of the Canibals that each others eate,<br/>

The Antropophague, and men whose heads<br/>

Grew beneath their shoulders. These things to heare,<br/>

Would Desdemona seriously incline:<br/>

But still the house Affaires would draw her hence:<br/>

Which euer as she could with haste dispatch,<br/>

She'l'd come againe, and with a greedie eare<br/>

Deuoure vp my discourse. Which I obseruing,<br/>

Tooke once a pliant houre, and found good meanes<br/>

To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,<br/>

That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate,<br/>

Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br/>

But not instinctiuely: I did consent,<br/>

And often did beguile her of her teares,<br/>

When I did speake of some distressefull stroke<br/>

That my youth suffer'd: My Storie being done,<br/>

She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses:<br/>

She swore in faith 'twas strange: 'twas passing strange,<br/>

'Twas pittifull: 'twas wondrous pittifull.<br/>

She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd<br/>

That Heauen had made her such a man. She thank'd me,<br/>

And bad me, if I had a Friend that lou'd her,<br/>

I should but teach him how to tell my Story,<br/>

And that would wooe her. Vpon this hint I spake,<br/>

She lou'd me for the dangers I had past,<br/>

And I lou'd her, that she did pitty them.<br/>

This onely is the witch-craft I haue vs'd.<br/>

Here comes the Ladie: Let her witnesse it.<br/>

<p id="id00175">Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.</p>

How to respect you. You are the Lord of duty,<br/>

I am hitherto your Daughter. But heere's my Husband;<br/>

And so much dutie, as my Mother shew'd<br/>

To you, preferring you before her Father:<br/>

So much I challenge, that I may professe<br/>

Due to the Moore my Lord<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00178">   Bra. God be with you: I haue done.<br/>

Please it your Grace, on to the State Affaires;<br/>

I had rather to adopt a Child, then get it.<br/>

Come hither Moore;<br/>

I here do giue thee that with all my heart,<br/>

Which but thou hast already, with all my heart<br/>

I would keepe from thee. For your sake (Iewell)<br/>

I am glad at soule, I haue no other Child,<br/>

For thy escape would teach me Tirranie<br/>

To hang clogges on them. I haue done my Lord<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00179">   Duke. Let me speake like your selfe:<br/>

And lay a Sentence,<br/>

Which as a grise, or step may helpe these Louers.<br/>

When remedies are past, the griefes are ended<br/>

By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.<br/>

To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon,<br/>

Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on.<br/>

What cannot be preseru'd, when Fortune takes:<br/>

Patience, her Iniury a mock'ry makes.<br/>

The rob'd that smiles, steales something from the Thiefe,<br/>

He robs himselfe, that spends a bootelesse griefe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00180">   Bra. So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile,<br/>

We loose it not so long as we can smile:<br/>

He beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares,<br/>

But the free comfort which from thence he heares.<br/>

But he beares both the Sentence, and the sorrow,<br/>

That to pay griefe, must of poore Patience borrow.<br/>

These Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall,<br/>

Being strong on both sides, are Equiuocall.<br/>

But words are words, I neuer yet did heare:<br/>

That the bruized heart was pierc'd through the eares.<br/>

I humbly beseech you proceed to th' Affaires of State<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00181">   Duke. The Turke with a most mighty Preparation
makes for Cyprus: Othello, the Fortitude of the place is
best knowne to you. And though we haue there a Substitute
of most allowed sufficiencie; yet opinion, a more
soueraigne Mistris of Effects, throwes a more safer
voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber
the glosse of your new Fortunes, with this more stubborne,
and boystrous expedition</p>

<p id="id00182">   Othe. The Tirant Custome, most Graue Senators,<br/>

Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre<br/>

My thrice-driuen bed of Downe. I do agnize<br/>

A Naturall and prompt Alacratie,<br/>

I finde in hardnesse: and do vndertake<br/>

This present Warres against the Ottamites.<br/>

Most humbly therefore bending to your State,<br/>

I craue fit disposition for my Wife,<br/>

Due reference of Place, and Exhibition,<br/>

With such Accomodation and besort<br/>

As leuels with her breeding<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00183">   Duke. Why at her Fathers?<br/>

  Bra. I will not haue it so<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00184">   Othe. Nor I</p>

<p id="id00185">   Des. Nor would I there recide,<br/>

To put my Father in impatient thoughts<br/>

By being in his eye. Most Gracious Duke,<br/>

To my vnfolding, lend your prosperous eare,<br/>

And let me finde a Charter in your voice<br/>

T' assist my simplenesse<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00186">   Duke. What would you Desdemona?<br/>

  Des. That I loue the Moore, to liue with him,<br/>

My downe-right violence, and storme of Fortunes,<br/>

May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdu'd<br/>

Euen to the very quality of my Lord;<br/>

I saw Othello's visage in his mind,<br/>

And to his Honours and his valiant parts,<br/>

Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate.<br/>

So that (deere Lords) if I be left behind<br/>

A Moth of Peace, and he go to the Warre,<br/>

The Rites for why I loue him, are bereft me:<br/>

And I a heauie interim shall support<br/>

By his deere absence. Let me go with him<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00187">   Othe. Let her haue your voice.<br/>

Vouch with me Heauen, I therefore beg it not<br/>

To please the pallate of my Appetite:<br/>

Nor to comply with heat the yong affects<br/>

In my defunct, and proper satisfaction.<br/>

But to be free, and bounteous to her minde:<br/>

And Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke<br/>

I will your serious and great businesse scant<br/>

When she is with me. No, when light wing'd Toyes<br/>

Of feather'd Cupid, seele with wanton dulnesse<br/>

My speculatiue, and offic'd Instrument:<br/>

That my Disports corrupt, and taint my businesse:<br/>

Let House-wiues make a Skillet of my Helme,<br/>

And all indigne, and base aduersities,<br/>

Make head against my Estimation<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00188">   Duke. Be it as you shall priuately determine,<br/>

Either for her stay, or going: th' Affaire cries hast:<br/>

And speed must answer it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00189">   Sen. You must away to night</p>

<p id="id00190">   Othe. With all my heart</p>

<p id="id00191">   Duke. At nine i'th' morning, here wee'l meete againe.<br/>

Othello, leaue some Officer behind<br/>

And he shall our Commission bring to you:<br/>

And such things else of qualitie and respect<br/>

As doth import you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00192">   Othe. So please your Grace, my Ancient,<br/>

A man he is of honesty and trust:<br/>

To his conueyance I assigne my wife,<br/>

With what else needfull, your good Grace shall think<br/>

To be sent after me<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00193">   Duke. Let it be so:<br/>

Good night to euery one. And Noble Signior,<br/>

If Vertue no delighted Beautie lacke,<br/>

Your Son-in-law is farre more Faire then Blacke<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00194">   Sen. Adieu braue Moore, vse Desdemona well</p>

<p id="id00195">   Bra. Looke to her (Moore) if thou hast eies to see:<br/>

She ha's deceiu'd her Father, and may thee.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00196">  Othe. My life vpon her faith. Honest Iago,<br/>

My Desdemona must I leaue to thee:<br/>

I prythee let thy wife attend on her,<br/>

And bring them after in the best aduantage.<br/>

Come Desdemona, I haue but an houre<br/>

Of Loue, of wordly matter, and direction<br/>

To spend with thee. We must obey the time.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00197">  Rod. Iago</p>

<p id="id00198">   Iago. What saist thou Noble heart?<br/>

  Rod. What will I do, think'st thou?<br/>

  Iago. Why go to bed and sleepe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00199">   Rod. I will incontinently drowne my selfe</p>

<p id="id00200">   Iago. If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why
thou silly Gentleman?
  Rod. It is sillynesse to liue, when to liue is torment:
and then haue we a prescription to dye, when death is
our Physition</p>

<p id="id00201">   Iago. Oh villanous: I haue look'd vpon the world
for foure times seuen yeares, and since I could distinguish
betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that
knew how to loue himselfe. Ere I would say, I would
drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would
change my Humanity with a Baboone</p>

<p id="id00202" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Rod. What should I do? I confesse it is my shame
to be so fond, but it is not in my vertue to amend it</p>

<p id="id00203">   Iago. Vertue? A figge, 'tis in our selues that we are
thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,
our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Nettels,
or sowe Lettice: Set Hisope, and weede vp Time:
Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or distract it with
many: either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse, or manured
with Industry, why the power, and Corrigeable authoritie
of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues
had not one Scale of Reason, to poize another of Sensualitie,
the blood, and basenesse of our Natures would
conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions. But we
haue Reason to coole our raging Motions, our carnall
Stings, or vnbitted Lusts: whereof I take this, that you
call Loue, to be a Sect, or Seyen</p>

<p id="id00204">   Rod. It cannot be</p>

<p id="id00205">   Iago. It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission
of the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy selfe? Drown
Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profest me thy Friend,
and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing, with Cables of
perdurable toughnesse. I could neuer better steed thee
then now. Put Money in thy purse: follow thou the
Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an vsurp'd Beard. I say
put Money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona
should continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in
thy purse: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commencement
in her, and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration,
put but Money in thy purse. These Moores
are changeable in their wils: fill thy purse with Money.
The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts,
shalbe to him shortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She
must change for youth: when she is sated with his body
she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Money
in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe, do
it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Money
thou canst: If Sanctimonie, and a fraile vow, betwixt
an erring Barbarian, and super-subtle Venetian be
not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou
shalt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drowning
thy selfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou rather
to be hang'd in Compassing thy ioy, then to be
drown'd, and go without her</p>

<p id="id00206">   Rodo. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
the issue?
  Iago. Thou art sure of me: Go make Money: I haue
told thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I
hate the Moore. My cause is hearted; thine hath no lesse
reason. Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge, against
him. If thou canst Cuckold him, thou dost thy selfe a
pleasure, me a sport. There are many Euents in the
Wombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauerse, go,
prouide thy Money. We will haue more of this to morrow.
Adieu</p>

<p id="id00207">   Rod. Where shall we meete i'th' morning?<br/>

  Iago. At my Lodging<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00208">   Rod. Ile be with thee betimes</p>

<p id="id00209">   Iago. Go too, farewell. Do you heare Rodorigo?<br/>

  Rod. Ile sell all my Land.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00210">  Iago. Thus do I euer make my Foole, my purse:<br/>

For I mine owne gain'd knowledge should prophane<br/>

If I would time expend with such Snipe,<br/>

But for my Sport, and Profit: I hate the Moore,<br/>

And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets<br/>

She ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true,<br/>

But I, for meere suspition in that kinde,<br/>

Will do, as if for Surety. He holds me well,<br/>

The better shall my purpose worke on him:<br/>

Cassio's a proper man: Let me see now,<br/>

To get his Place, and to plume vp my will<br/>

In double Knauery. How? How? Let's see.<br/>

After some time, to abuse Othello's eares,<br/>

That he is too familiar with his wife:<br/>

He hath a person, and a smooth dispose<br/>

To be suspected: fram'd to make women false.<br/>

The Moore is of a free, and open Nature,<br/>

That thinkes men honest, that but seeme to be so,<br/>

And will as tenderly be lead by'th' Nose<br/>

As Asses are:<br/>

I hau't: it is engendred: Hell, and Night,<br/>

Must bring this monstrous Birth, to the worlds light.<br/>

<p id="id00211">Actus Secundus. Scena Prima.</p>

<p id="id00212">Enter Montano, and two Gentlemen.</p>

<p id="id00213">  Mon. What from the Cape, can you discerne at Sea?<br/>

  1.Gent. Nothing at all, it is a high wrought Flood:<br/>

I cannot 'twixt the Heauen, and the Maine,<br/>

Descry a Saile<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00214">   Mon. Me thinks, the wind hath spoke aloud at Land,<br/>

A fuller blast ne're shooke our Battlements:<br/>

If it hath ruffiand so vpon the Sea,<br/>

What ribbes of Oake, when Mountaines melt on them,<br/>

Can hold the Morties. What shall we heare of this?<br/>

  2 A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet:<br/>

For do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore,<br/>

The chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds,<br/>

The winde-shak'd-Surge, with high &amp; monstrous Maine<br/>

Seemes to cast water on the burning Beare,<br/>

And quench the Guards of th' euer-fixed Pole:<br/>

I neuer did like mollestation view<br/>

On the enchafed Flood<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00215">   Men. If that the Turkish Fleete<br/>

Be not enshelter'd, and embay'd, they are drown'd,<br/>

It is impossible to beare it out.<br/>

Enter a Gentleman.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00216">  3 Newes Laddes: our warres are done:<br/>

The desperate Tempest hath so bang'd the Turkes,<br/>

That their designement halts. A Noble ship of Venice,<br/>

Hath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance<br/>

On most part of their Fleet<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00217">   Mon. How? Is this true?<br/>

  3 The Ship is heere put in: A Verennessa, Michael Cassio<br/>

Lieutenant to the warlike Moore, Othello,<br/>

Is come on Shore: the Moore himselfe at Sea,<br/>

And is in full Commission heere for Cyprus<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00218">   Mon. I am glad on't:<br/>

'Tis a worthy Gouernour<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00219">   3 But this same Cassio, though he speake of comfort,<br/>

Touching the Turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly,<br/>

And praye the Moore be safe; for they were parted<br/>

With fowle and violent Tempest<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00220">   Mon. Pray Heauens he be:<br/>

For I haue seru'd him, and the man commands<br/>

Like a full Soldier. Let's to the Sea-side (hoa)<br/>

As well to see the Vessell that's come in,<br/>

As to throw-out our eyes for braue Othello,<br/>

Euen till we make the Maine, and th' Eriall blew,<br/>

An indistinct regard<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00221">   Gent. Come, let's do so;<br/>

For euery Minute is expectancie<br/>

Of more Arriuancie.<br/>

Enter Cassio.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00222">  Cassi. Thankes you, the valiant of the warlike Isle,<br/>

That so approoue the Moore: Oh let the Heauens<br/>

Giue him defence against the Elements,<br/>

For I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00223">   Mon. Is he well ship'd?<br/>

  Cassio. His Barke is stoutly Timber'd, and his Pylot<br/>

Of verie expert, and approu'd Allowance;<br/>

Therefore my hope's (not surfetted to death)<br/>

Stand in bold Cure<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00224">   Within. A Saile, a Saile, a Saile</p>

<p id="id00225">   Cassio. What noise?<br/>

  Gent. The Towne is empty; on the brow o'th' Sea<br/>

Stand rankes of People and they cry, a Saile<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00226">   Cassio. My hopes do shape him for the Gouernor</p>

<p id="id00227">   Gent. They do discharge their Shot of Courtesie,<br/>

Our Friends, at least<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00228">   Cassio. I pray you Sir, go forth,<br/>

And giue vs truth who 'tis that is arriu'd<br/>

<p id="id00229">   Gent. I shall.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00230">  Mon. But good Lieutenant, is your Generall wiu'd?<br/>

  Cassio. Most fortunately: he hath atchieu'd a Maid<br/>

That paragons description, and wilde Fame:<br/>

One that excels the quirkes of Blazoning pens,<br/>

And in th' essentiall Vesture of Creation,<br/>

Do's tyre the Ingeniuer.<br/>

Enter Gentleman.<br/>

<p id="id00231">How now? Who ha's put in?<br/>

  Gent. 'Tis one Iago, Auncient to the Generall<br/>

<p id="id00232">   Cassio. Ha's had most fauourable, and happie speed:<br/>

Tempests themselues, high Seas, and howling windes,<br/>

The gutter'd-Rockes, and Congregated Sands,<br/>

Traitors ensteep'd, to enclogge the guiltlesse Keele,<br/>

As hauing sence of Beautie, do omit<br/>

Their mortall Natures, letting go safely by<br/>

The Diuine Desdemona<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00233">   Mon. What is she?<br/>

  Cassio. She that I spake of:<br/>

Our great Captains Captaine,<br/>

Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,<br/>

Whose footing heere anticipates our thoughts,<br/>

A Senights speed. Great Ioue, Othello guard,<br/>

And swell his Saile with thine owne powrefull breath,<br/>

That he may blesse this Bay with his tall Ship,<br/>

Make loues quicke pants in Desdemonaes Armes,<br/>

Giue renew'd fire to our extincted Spirits.<br/>

<p id="id00234">Enter Desdemona, Iago, Rodorigo, and Aemilia.</p>

<p id="id00235">Oh behold,<br/>

The Riches of the Ship is come on shore:<br/>

You men of Cyprus, let her haue your knees.<br/>

Haile to thee Ladie: and the grace of Heauen,<br/>

Enwheele thee round<br/>

<p id="id00236">   Des. I thanke you, Valiant Cassio,<br/>

What tydings can you tell of my Lord?<br/>

  Cas. He is not yet arriu'd, nor know I ought<br/>

But that he's well, and will be shortly heere<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00237">   Des. Oh, but I feare:<br/>

How lost you company?<br/>

  Cassio. The great Contention of Sea, and Skies<br/>

Parted our fellowship. But hearke, a Saile<br/>

<p id="id00238">   Within. A Saile, a Saile</p>

<p id="id00239">   Gent. They giue this greeting to the Cittadell:<br/>

This likewise is a Friend<br/>

<p id="id00240">   Cassio. See for the Newes:<br/>

Good Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome Mistris:<br/>

Let it not gaule your patience (good Iago)<br/>

That I extend my Manners. 'Tis my breeding,<br/>

That giues me this bold shew of Curtesie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00241">   Iago. Sir, would she giue you so much of her lippes,<br/>

As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me,<br/>

You would haue enough<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00242">   Des. Alas: she ha's no speech</p>

<p id="id00243">   Iago. Infaith too much:<br/>

I finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe.<br/>

Marry before your Ladyship, I grant,<br/>

She puts her tongue a little in her heart,<br/>

And chides with thinking<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00244">   aemil. You haue little cause to say so</p>

<p id="id00245">   Iago. Come on, come on: you are Pictures out of<br/>

Saints in your Iniuries: Diuels being offended:<br/>

Players in your Huswiferie, and Huswiues in your<br/>

Beds<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00246">   Des. Oh, fie vpon thee, Slanderer</p>

<p id="id00247">   Iago. Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke,<br/>

You rise to play, and go to bed to worke.<br/>

Aemil. You shall not write my praise<br/>

<p id="id00248">   Iago. No, let me not</p>

<p id="id00249">   Desde. What would'st write of me, if thou should'st<br/>

praise me?<br/>

  Iago. Oh, gentle Lady, do not put me too't,<br/>

For I am nothing, if not Criticall<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00250">   Des. Come on, assay.<br/>

There's one gone to the Harbour?<br/>

  Iago. I Madam<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00251">   Des. I am not merry: but I do beguile<br/>

The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.<br/>

Come, how would'st thou praise me?<br/>

  Iago. I am about it, but indeed my inuention comes<br/>

from my pate, as Birdlyme do's from Freeze, it pluckes<br/>

out Braines and all. But my Muse labours, and thus she<br/>

is deliuer'd.<br/>

If she be faire, and wise: fairenesse, and wit,<br/>

The ones for vse, the other vseth it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00252">   Des. Well prais'd:<br/>

How if she be Blacke and Witty?<br/>

  Iago. If she be blacke, and thereto haue a wit,<br/>

She'le find a white, that shall her blacknesse fit<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00253">   Des. Worse, and worse.<br/>

Aemil. How if Faire, and Foolish?<br/>

  Iago. She neuer yet was foolish that was faire,<br/>

For euen her folly helpt her to an heire<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00254">   Desde. These are old fond Paradoxes, to make Fooles
laugh i'th' Alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou
for her that's Foule, and Foolish</p>

<p id="id00255">   Iago. There's none so foule and foolish thereunto,<br/>

But do's foule pranks, which faire, and wise-ones do<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00256">   Desde. Oh heauy ignorance: thou praisest the worst
best. But what praise could'st thou bestow on a deseruing
woman indeed? One, that in the authorithy of her
merit, did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it
selfe</p>

<p id="id00257">   Iago. She that was euer faire, and neuer proud,<br/>

Had Tongue at will, and yet was neuer loud:<br/>

Neuer lackt Gold, and yet went neuer gay,<br/>

Fled from her wish, and yet said now I may.<br/>

She that being angred, her reuenge being nie,<br/>

Bad her wrong stay, and her displeasure flie:<br/>

She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile,<br/>

To change the Cods-head for the Salmons taile:<br/>

She that could thinke, and neu'r disclose her mind,<br/>

See Suitors following, and not looke behind:<br/>

She was a wight, (if euer such wightes were)<br/>

  Des. To do what?<br/>

  Iago. To suckle Fooles, and chronicle small Beere<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00258">   Desde. Oh most lame and impotent conclusion. Do
not learne of him aemillia, though he be thy husband.
How say you (Cassio) is he not a most prophane, and liberall
Counsailor?
  Cassio. He speakes home (Madam) you may rellish
him more in the Souldier, then in the Scholler</p>

<p id="id00259">   Iago. He takes her by the palme: I, well said, whisper.
With as little a web as this, will I ensnare as great
a Fly as Cassio. I smile vpon her, do: I will giue thee
in thine owne Courtship. You say true, 'tis so indeed.
If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie,
it had beene better you had not kiss'd your three fingers
so oft, which now againe you are most apt to play
the Sir, in. Very good: well kiss'd, and excellent Curtsie:
'tis so indeed. Yet againe, your fingers to your
lippes? Would they were Cluster-pipes for your
sake.
The Moore I know his Trumpet</p>

<p id="id00260">   Cassio. 'Tis truely so</p>

<p id="id00261">   Des. Let's meete him, and recieue him</p>

If after euery Tempest, come such Calmes,<br/>

May the windes blow, till they haue waken'd death:<br/>

And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas<br/>

'Twere now to be most happy. For I feare,<br/>

My Soule hath her content so absolute,<br/>

That not another comfort like to this,<br/>

Succeedes in vnknowne Fate<br/>

<p id="id00267">   Othe. Amen to that (sweet Powers)<br/>

I cannot speake enough of this content,<br/>

It stoppes me heere: it is too much of ioy.<br/>

And this, and this the greatest discords be<br/>

That ere our hearts shall make<br/>

<p id="id00269">   Othe. Come: let vs to the Castle.<br/>

Newes (Friends) our Warres are done:<br/>

The Turkes are drown'd.<br/>

How do's my old Acquaintance of this Isle?<br/>

(Hony) you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus,<br/>

I haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet,<br/>

I prattle out of fashion, and I doate<br/>

In mine owne comforts. I prythee, good Iago,<br/>

Go to the Bay, and disimbarke my Coffers:<br/>

Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell,<br/>

He is a good one, and his worthynesse<br/>

Do's challenge much respect. Come Desdemona,<br/>

Once more well met at Cyprus.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00270">Exit Othello and Desdemona.</p>

<p id="id00271">  Iago. Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour.
Come thither, if thou be'st Valiant, (as they say base men
being in Loue, haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures,
more then is natiue to them) list-me; the Lieutenant to
night watches on the Court of Guard. First, I must tell
thee this: Desdemona, is directly in loue with him</p>

<p id="id00272">   Rod. With him? Why, 'tis not possible</p>

<p id="id00273">   Iago. Lay thy finger thus: and let thy soule be instructed.
Marke me with what violence she first lou'd
the Moore, but for bragging, and telling her fantasticall
lies. To loue him still for prating, let not thy discreet
heart thinke it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight
shall she haue to looke on the diuell? When the Blood
is made dull with the Act of Sport, there should be a
game to enflame it, and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite.
Louelinesse in fauour, simpathy in yeares, Manners,
and Beauties: all which the Moore is defectiue in. Now
for want of these requir'd Conueniences, her delicate
tendernesse wil finde it selfe abus'd, begin to heaue the,
gorge, disrellish and abhorre the Moore, very Nature wil
instruct her in it, and compell her to some second choice.
Now Sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and vnforc'd
position) who stands so eminent in the degree of
this Fortune, as Cassio do's: a knaue very voluble: no
further conscionable, then in putting on the meere forme
of Ciuill, and Humaine seeming, for the better compasse
of his salt, and most hidden loose Affection? Why none,
why none: A slipper, and subtle knaue, a finder of occasion:
that he's an eye can stampe, and counterfeit Aduantages,
though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe.
A diuelish knaue: besides, the knaue is handsome, young:
and hath all those requisites in him, that folly and greene
mindes looke after. A pestilent compleat knaue, and the
woman hath found him already</p>

<p id="id00274" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Rodo. I cannot beleeue that in her, she's full of most
bless'd condition</p>

<p id="id00275">   Iago. Bless'd figges-end. The Wine she drinkes is
made of grapes. If shee had beene bless'd, shee would
neuer haue lou'd the Moore: Bless'd pudding. Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palme of his hand? Didst not
marke that?
  Rod. Yes, that I did: but that was but curtesie</p>

<p id="id00276">   Iago . Leacherie by this hand: an Index, and obscure
prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts.
They met so neere with their lippes, that their breathes
embrac'd together. Villanous thoughts Rodorigo, when
these mutabilities so marshall the way, hard at hand
comes the Master, and maine exercise, th' incorporate
conclusion: Pish. But Sir, be you rul'd by me. I haue
brought you from Venice. Watch you to night: for
the Command, Ile lay't vpon you. Cassio knowes you
not: Ile not be farre from you. Do you finde some occasion
to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or
tainting his discipline, or from what other course
you please, which the time shall more fauorably minister</p>

<p id="id00277">   Rod. Well</p>

<p id="id00278">   Iago. Sir, he's rash, and very sodaine in Choller: and
happely may strike at you, prouoke him that he may: for
euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny.
Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe,
but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you
haue a shorter iourney to your desires, by the meanes I
shall then haue to preferre them. And the impediment
most profitably remoued, without the which there were
no expectation of our prosperitie</p>

<p id="id00279">   Rodo. I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity</p>

<p id="id00280">   Iago. I warrant thee. Meete me by and by at the<br/>

And I dare thinke, he'le proue to Desdemona<br/>

Not out of absolute Lust, (though peraduenture<br/>

Till I am eeuen'd with him, wife, for wife.<br/>

Or fayling so, yet that I put the Moore,<br/>

At least into a Ielouzie so strong<br/>

That iudgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,<br/>

If this poore Trash of Venice, whom I trace<br/>

For his quicke hunting, stand the putting on,<br/>

Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br/>

Abuse him to the Moore, in the right garbe<br/>

Vnlesse selfe-charitie be sometimes a vice,<br/>

And passion (hauing my best iudgement collied)<br/>

Assaies to leade the way. If I once stir,<br/>

Or do but lift this Arme, the best of you<br/>

Shall sinke in my rebuke. Giue me to know<br/>

How this foule Rout began: Who set it on,<br/>

And he that is approu'd in this offence,<br/>

Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,<br/>

Shall loose me. What in a Towne of warre,<br/>

Yet wilde, the peoples hearts brim-full of feare,<br/>

To Manage priuate, and domesticke Quarrell?<br/>

In night, and on the Court and Guard of safetie?<br/>

'Tis monstrous: Iago, who began't?<br/>

Thou dost deliuer more, or lesse then Truth,<br/>

<p id="id00346">   Iago. Touch me not so neere,<br/>

I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth,<br/>

Then it should do offence to Michaell Cassio.<br/>

Yet I perswade my selfe, to speake the truth<br/>

Shall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall:<br/>

Montano and my selfe being in speech,<br/>

There comes a Fellow, crying out for helpe,<br/>

And Cassio following him with determin'd Sword<br/>

To execute vpon him. Sir, this Gentleman,<br/>

Steppes in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:<br/>

My selfe, the crying Fellow did pursue,<br/>

Least by his clamour (as it so fell out)<br/>

The Towne might fall in fright. He, (swift of foote)<br/>

Out-ran my purpose: and I return'd then rather<br/>

For that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords,<br/>

And Cassio high in oath: Which till to night<br/>

I nere might say before. When I came backe<br/>

(For this was briefe) I found them close together<br/>

At blow, and thrust, euen as againe they were<br/>

When you your selfe did part them.<br/>

More of this matter cannot I report,<br/>

But Men are Men: The best sometimes forget,<br/>

Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,<br/>

As men in rage strike those that wish them best,<br/>

Yet surely Cassio, I beleeue receiu'd<br/>

From him that fled, some strange Indignitie,<br/>

Which patience could not passe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00347">   Othe. I know Iago<br/>

<p id="id00353">   Iago. As I am an honest man I had thought you had
receiued some bodily wound; there is more sence in that

imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deseruing.
You haue lost no Reputation at all, vnlesse you
repute your selfe such a looser. What man, there are
more wayes to recouer the Generall againe. You are
but now cast in his moode, (a punishment more in policie,

Sword? What had he done to you?<br/>

  Cas. I know not<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00356">   Iago. Is't possible?
  Cas. I remember a masse of things, but nothing distinctly:
a Quarrell, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that
men should put an Enemie in their mouthes, to steale away
their Braines? that we should with ioy, pleasance,
reuell and applause, transforme our selues into Beasts</p>

<p id="id00357">   Iago. Why? But you are now well enough: how
came you thus recouered?
  Cas. It hath pleas'd the diuell drunkennesse, to giue
place to the diuell wrath, one vnperfectnesse, shewes me
another to make me frankly despise my selfe</p>

<p id="id00358">   Iago. Come, you are too seuere a Moraller. As the<br/>

Time, the Place, &amp; the Condition of this Country stands<br/>

I could hartily wish this had not befalne: but since it is, as<br/>

it is, mend it for your owne good<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00359">   Cas. I will aske him for my Place againe, he shall tell
me, I am a drunkard: had I as many mouthes as Hydra,
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible
man, by and by a Foole, and presently a Beast. Oh
strange! Euery inordinate cup is vnbless'd, and the Ingredient
is a diuell</p>

<p id="id00360">   Iago. Come, come: good wine, is a good familiar<br/>

Creature, if it be well vs'd: exclaime no more against it.<br/>

And good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue<br/>

you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00361">   Cassio. I haue well approued it, Sir. I drunke?
  Iago. You, or any man liuing, may be drunke at a
time man. I tell you what you shall do: Our General's
Wife, is now the Generall. I may say so, in this respect,
for that he hath deuoted, and giuen vp himselfe to the
Contemplation, marke: and deuotement of her parts
and Graces. Confesse your selfe freely to her: Importune
her helpe to put you in your place againe. She is
of so free, so kinde, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
she holds it a vice in her goodnesse, not to do more
then she is requested. This broken ioynt betweene
you, and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my
Fortunes against any lay worth naming, this cracke of
your Loue, shall grow stronger, then it was before</p>

<p id="id00362">   Cassio. You aduise me well</p>

<p id="id00363" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Iago. I protest in the sinceritie of Loue, and honest
kindnesse</p>

<p id="id00364">   Cassio. I thinke it freely: and betimes in the morning,
I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake
for me: I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me</p>

<p id="id00365" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Iago. You are in the right: good night Lieutenant, I
must to the Watch</p>

<p id="id00366">   Cassio. Good night, honest Iago.</p>

<p id="id00367">Exit Cassio.</p>

<p id="id00368">  Iago. And what's he then,<br/>

That saies I play the Villaine?<br/>

When this aduise is free I giue, and honest,<br/>

Proball to thinking, and indeed the course<br/>

To win the Moore againe.<br/>

For 'tis most easie<br/>

Th' inclyning Desdemona to subdue<br/>

In any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull<br/>

As the free Elements. And then for her<br/>

To win the Moore, were to renownce his Baptisme,<br/>

All Seales, and Simbols of redeemed sin:<br/>

His Soule is so enfetter'd to her Loue,<br/>

That she may make, vnmake, do what she list,<br/>

Euen as her Appetite shall play the God,<br/>

With his weake Function. How am I then a Villaine,<br/>

To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course,<br/>

Directly to his good? Diuinitie of hell,<br/>

When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on,<br/>

They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes,<br/>

As I do now. For whiles this honest Foole<br/>

Plies Desdemona, to repaire his Fortune,<br/>

And she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore,<br/>

Ile powre this pestilence into his eare:<br/>

That she repeales him, for her bodies Lust,<br/>

And by how much she striues to do him good,<br/>

She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore.<br/>

So will I turne her vertue into pitch.<br/>

And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net,<br/>

That shall en-mash them all.<br/>

How now Rodorigo?<br/>

Enter Rodorigo.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00369">  Rodorigo. I do follow heere in the Chace, not
like a Hound that hunts, but one that filles vp the
Crie. My Money is almost spent; I haue bin to night
exceedingly well Cudgell'd: And I thinke the issue
will bee, I shall haue so much experience for my paines;
And so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, returne
againe to Venice</p>

<p id="id00370">   Iago. How poore are they that haue not Patience?<br/>

What wound did euer heale but by degrees?<br/>

Thou know'st we worke by Wit, and not by Witchcraft<br/>

And Wit depends on dilatory time:<br/>

Dos't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,<br/>

And thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd Cassio:<br/>

Though other things grow faire against the Sun,<br/>

Yet Fruites that blossome first, will first be ripe:<br/>

Content thy selfe, a-while. Introth 'tis Morning;<br/>

Pleasure, and Action, make the houres seeme short.<br/>

Retire thee, go where thou art Billited:<br/>

Away, I say, thou shalt know more heereafter:<br/>

Nay get thee gone.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00371">Exit Roderigo.</p>

<p id="id00372">Two things are to be done:<br/>

My Wife must moue for Cassio to her Mistris:<br/>

Ile set her on my selfe, a while, to draw the Moor apart,<br/>

And bring him iumpe, when he may Cassio finde<br/>

Soliciting his wife: I, that's the way:<br/>

Dull not Deuice, by coldnesse, and delay.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00373" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.</p>

<p id="id00374">Enter Cassio, Musitians, and Clowne.</p>

<p id="id00375">  Cassio. Masters, play heere, I wil content your paines,<br/>

Something that's briefe: and bid, goodmorrow General<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00376">   Clo. Why Masters, haue your Instruments bin in Naples,<br/>

that they speake i'th' Nose thus?<br/>

  Mus. How Sir? how?<br/>

  Clo. Are these I pray you, winde Instruments?<br/>

  Mus. I marry are they sir<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00377">   Clo. Oh, thereby hangs a tale</p>

<p id="id00378">   Mus. Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
  Clow. Marry sir, by many a winde Instrument that I
know. But Masters, heere's money for you: and the Generall
so likes your Musick, that he desires you for loues
sake to make no more noise with it</p>

<p id="id00379">   Mus. Well Sir, we will not</p>

<p id="id00380">   Clo. If you haue any Musicke that may not be heard,
too't againe. But (as they say) to heare Musicke, the Generall
do's not greatly care</p>

<p id="id00381">   Mus. We haue none such, sir</p>

<p id="id00382" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Clow. Then put vp your Pipes in your bagge, for Ile
away. Go, vanish into ayre, away.</p>

<p id="id00383">Exit Mu.</p>

<p id="id00384">  Cassio. Dost thou heare me, mine honest Friend?<br/>

  Clo. No, I heare not your honest Friend:<br/>

I heare you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00385">   Cassio. Prythee keepe vp thy Quillets, ther's a poore
peece of Gold for thee: if the Gentlewoman that attends
the Generall be stirring, tell her, there's one Cassio entreats
her a little fauour of Speech. Wilt thou do this?
  Clo. She is stirring sir: if she will stirre hither, I shall
seeme to notifie vnto her.</p>

<p id="id00386">Exit Clo.</p>

<p id="id00387">Enter Iago.</p>

<p id="id00388">In happy time, Iago</p>

<p id="id00389">   Iago. You haue not bin a-bed then?<br/>

  Cassio. Why no: the day had broke before we parted.<br/>

I haue made bold (Iago) to send in to your wife:<br/>

My suite to her is, that she will to vertuous Desdemona<br/>

Procure me some accesse<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00390">   Iago. Ile send her to you presently:<br/>

And Ile deuise a meane to draw the Moore<br/>

Out of the way, that your conuerse and businesse<br/>

May be more free.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00391">Exit</p>

<p id="id00392">  Cassio. I humbly thanke you for't. I neuer knew<br/>

A Florentine more kinde, and honest.<br/>

Enter aemilia.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00393">Aemil. Goodmorrow (good Lieutenant) I am sorrie<br/>

For your displeasure: but all will sure be well.<br/>

The Generall and his wife are talking of it,<br/>

And she speakes for you stoutly. The Moore replies,<br/>

That he you hurt is of great Fame in Cyprus,<br/>

And great Affinitie: and that in wholsome Wisedome<br/>

He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loues you<br/>

And needs no other Suitor, but his likings<br/>

To bring you in againe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00394">   Cassio. Yet I beseech you,<br/>

If you thinke fit, or that it may be done,<br/>

Giue me aduantage of some breefe Discourse<br/>

With Desdemon alone.<br/>

Aemil. Pray you come in:<br/>

I will bestow you where you shall haue time<br/>

To speake your bosome freely<br/>

And by him do my duties to the Senate:<br/>

That done, I will be walking on the Workes,<br/>

All my abilities in thy behalfe.<br/>

Aemil. Good Madam do:<br/>

I warrant it greeues my Husband,<br/>

As if the cause were his<br/>

<p id="id00405">   Des. Oh that's an honest Fellow, Do not doubt Cassio<br/>

But I will haue my Lord, and you againe<br/>

As friendly as you were<br/>

What euer shall become of Michael Cassio,<br/>

He's neuer any thing but your true Seruant<br/>

<p id="id00407">   Des. I know't: I thanke you: you do loue my Lord:<br/>

You haue knowne him long, and be you well assur'd<br/>

He shall in strangenesse stand no farther off,<br/>

Then in a politique distance<br/>

That policie may either last so long,<br/>

Or feede vpon such nice and waterish diet,<br/>

Or breede it selfe so out of Circumstances,<br/>

That I being absent, and my place supply'd,<br/>

My Generall will forget my Loue, and Seruice<br/>

<p id="id00409">   Des. Do not doubt that: before aemilia here,<br/>

I giue thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,<br/>

If I do vow a friendship, Ile performe it<br/>

To the last Article. My Lord shall neuer rest,<br/>

Ile watch him tame, and talke him out of patience;<br/>

His Bed shall seeme a Schoole, his Boord a Shrift,<br/>

Ile intermingle euery thing he do's<br/>

With Cassio's suite: Therefore be merry Cassio,<br/>

For thy Solicitor shall rather dye,<br/>

Then giue thy cause away.<br/>

Enter Othello, and Iago.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00410">Aemil. Madam, heere comes my Lord</p>

<p id="id00411">   Cassio. Madam, Ile take my leaue</p>

<p id="id00412">   Des. Why stay, and heare me speake</p>

<p id="id00413">   Cassio. Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,<br/>

Vnfit for mine owne purposes<br/>

<p id="id00414">   Des. Well, do your discretion.</p>

<p id="id00415">Exit Cassio.</p>

<p id="id00416">  Iago. Hah? I like not that</p>

<p id="id00417">   Othel. What dost thou say?<br/>

  Iago. Nothing my Lord; or if- I know not what<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00418">   Othel. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?<br/>

  Iago. Cassio my Lord? No sure, I cannot thinke it<br/>

That he would steale away so guilty-like,<br/>

Seeing your comming<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00419">   Oth. I do beleeue 'twas he</p>

<p id="id00420">   Des. How now my Lord?<br/>

I haue bin talking with a Suitor heere,<br/>

A man that languishes in your displeasure<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00421">   Oth. Who is't you meane?<br/>

  Des. Why your Lieutenant Cassio: Good my Lord,<br/>

If I haue any grace, or power to moue you,<br/>

His present reconciliation take.<br/>

For if he be not one, that truly loues you,<br/>

That erres in Ignorance, and not in Cunning,<br/>

I haue no iudgement in an honest face.<br/>

I prythee call him backe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00422">   Oth. Went he hence now?<br/>

  Des. I sooth; so humbled,<br/>

That he hath left part of his greefe with mee<br/>

To suffer with him. Good Loue, call him backe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00423">   Othel. Not now (sweet Desdemon) some other time</p>

<p id="id00424">   Des. But shall't be shortly?<br/>

  Oth. The sooner (Sweet) for you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00425">   Des. Shall't be to night, at Supper?<br/>

  Oth. No, not to night<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00426">   Des. To morrow Dinner then?<br/>

  Oth. I shall not dine at home:<br/>

I meete the Captaines at the Cittadell<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00427">   Des. Why then to morrow night, on Tuesday morne,<br/>

On Tuesday noone, or night; on Wensday Morne.<br/>

I prythee name the time, but let it not<br/>

Exceed three dayes. Infaith hee's penitent:<br/>

And yet his Trespasse, in our common reason<br/>

(Saue that they say the warres must make example)<br/>

Out of her best, is not almost a fault<br/>

T' encurre a priuate checke. When shall he come?<br/>

Tell me Othello. I wonder in my Soule<br/>

What you would aske me, that I should deny,<br/>

Or stand so mam'ring on? What? Michael Cassio,<br/>

That came a woing with you? and so many a time<br/>

(When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly)<br/>

Hath tane your part, to haue so much to do<br/>

To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00428">   Oth. Prythee no more: Let him come when he will:<br/>

I will deny thee nothing<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00429">   Des. Why, this is not a Boone:<br/>

'Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues,<br/>

Or feede on nourishing dishes, or keepe you warme,<br/>

Or sue to you, to do a peculiar profit<br/>

To your owne person. Nay, when I haue a suite<br/>

Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed,<br/>

It shall be full of poize, and difficult waight,<br/>

And fearefull to be granted<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00430">   Oth. I will deny thee nothing.<br/>

Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,<br/>

To leaue me but a little to my selfe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00431">   Des. Shall I deny you? No: farewell my Lord</p>

<p id="id00432">   Oth. Farewell my Desdemona, Ile come to thee strait</p>

<p id="id00433">   Des. aemilia come; be as your Fancies teach you:<br/>

What ere you be, I am obedient.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00434">  Oth. Excellent wretch: Perdition catch my Soule<br/>

But I do loue thee: and when I loue thee not,<br/>

Chaos is come againe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00435">   Iago. My Noble Lord</p>

<p id="id00436">   Oth. What dost thou say, Iago?<br/>

  Iago. Did Michael Cassio<br/>

When he woo'd my Lady, know of your loue?<br/>

  Oth. He did, from first to last:<br/>

Why dost thou aske?<br/>

  Iago. But for a satisfaction of my Thought,<br/>

No further harme<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00437">   Oth. Why of thy thought, Iago?<br/>

  Iago. I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00438">   Oth. O yes, and went betweene vs very oft</p>

<p id="id00439">   Iago. Indeed?<br/>

  Oth. Indeed? I indeed. Discern'st thou ought in that?<br/>

Is he not honest?<br/>

  Iago. Honest, my Lord?<br/>

  Oth. Honest? I, Honest<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00440">   Iago. My Lord, for ought I know</p>

<p id="id00441">   Oth. What do'st thou thinke?<br/>

  Iago. Thinke, my Lord?<br/>

  Oth. Thinke, my Lord? Alas, thou ecchos't me;<br/>

As if there were some Monster in thy thought<br/>

Too hideous to be shewne. Thou dost mean somthing:<br/>

I heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that,<br/>

When Cassio left my wife. What didd'st not like?<br/>

And when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile,<br/>

Of my whole course of wooing; thou cried'st, Indeede?<br/>

And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,<br/>

As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine<br/>

Some horrible Conceite. If thou do'st loue me,<br/>

Shew me thy thought<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00442">   Iago. My Lord, you know I loue you</p>

<p id="id00443">   Oth. I thinke thou do'st:<br/>

And for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie,<br/>

And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,<br/>

Therefore these stops of thine, fright me the more:<br/>

For such things in a false disloyall Knaue<br/>

Are trickes of Custome: but in a man that's iust,<br/>

They're close dilations, working from the heart,<br/>

That Passion cannot rule<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00444">   Iago. For Michael Cassio,<br/>

I dare be sworne, I thinke that he is honest<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00445">   Oth. I thinke so too</p>

<p id="id00446">   Iago. Men should be what they seeme,<br/>

Or those that be not, would they might seeme none<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00447">   Oth. Certaine, men should be what they seeme</p>

<p id="id00448">   Iago. Why then I thinke Cassio's an honest man</p>

<p id="id00449">   Oth. Nay, yet there's more in this?<br/>

I prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings,<br/>

As thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts<br/>

The worst of words<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00450">   Iago. Good my Lord pardon me,<br/>

Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie,<br/>

I am not bound to that: All Slaues are free:<br/>

Vtter my Thoughts? Why say, they are vild, and falce?<br/>

As where's that Palace, whereinto foule things<br/>

Sometimes intrude not? Who ha's that breast so pure,<br/>

Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions<br/>

Keepe Leetes, and Law-dayes, and in Sessions sit<br/>

With meditations lawfull?<br/>

  Oth. Thou do'st conspire against thy Friend (Iago)<br/>

If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his eare<br/>

A stranger to thy Thoughts<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00451">   Iago. I do beseech you,<br/>

Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse<br/>

(As I confesse it is my Natures plague<br/>

To spy into Abuses, and of my iealousie<br/>

Shapes faults that are not) that your wisedome<br/>

From one, that so imperfectly conceits,<br/>

Would take no notice, nor build your selfe a trouble<br/>

Out of his scattering, and vnsure obseruance:<br/>

It were not for your quiet, nor your good,<br/>

Nor for my Manhood, Honesty, and Wisedome,<br/>

To let you know my thoughts<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00452">   Oth. What dost thou meane?<br/>

  Iago. Good name in Man, &amp; woman (deere my Lord)<br/>

Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules;<br/>

Who steales my purse, steales trash:<br/>

'Tis something, nothing;<br/>

'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has bin slaue to thousands:<br/>

But he that filches from me my good Name,<br/>

Robs me of that, which not enriches him,<br/>

And makes me poore indeed<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00453">   Oth. Ile know thy Thoughts</p>

<p id="id00454">   Iago. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,<br/>

Nor shall not, whil'st 'tis in my custodie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00455">   Oth. Ha?<br/>

  Iago. Oh, beware my Lord, of iealousie,<br/>

It is the greene-ey'd Monster, which doth mocke<br/>

The meate it feeds on. That Cuckold liues in blisse,<br/>

Who certaine of his Fate, loues not his wronger:<br/>

But oh, what damned minutes tels he ore,<br/>

Who dotes, yet doubts: Suspects, yet soundly loues?<br/>

  Oth. O miserie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00456">   Iago. Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough,<br/>

But Riches finelesse, is as poore as Winter,<br/>

To him that euer feares he shall be poore:<br/>

Good Heauen, the Soules of all my Tribe defend<br/>

From Iealousie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00457">   Oth. Why? why is this?<br/>

Think'st thou, I'ld make a Life of Iealousie;<br/>

To follow still the changes of the Moone<br/>

With fresh suspitions? No: to be once in doubt,<br/>

Is to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat,<br/>

When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule<br/>

To such exufflicate, and blow'd Surmises,<br/>

Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me Iealious,<br/>

To say my wife is faire, feeds well, loues company,<br/>

Is free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances:<br/>

Where Vertue is, these are more vertuous.<br/>

Nor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw<br/>

The smallest feare, or doubt of her reuolt,<br/>

For she had eyes, and chose me. No Iago,<br/>

Ile see before I doubt; when I doubt, proue;<br/>

And on the proofe, there is no more but this,<br/>

Away at once with Loue, or Iealousie<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00458">   Ia. I am glad of this: For now I shall haue reason<br/>

To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you<br/>

With franker spirit. Therefore (as I am bound)<br/>

Receiue it from me. I speake not yet of proofe:<br/>

Looke to your wife, obserue her well with Cassio,<br/>

Weare your eyes, thus: not Iealious, nor Secure:<br/>

I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,<br/>

Out of selfe-Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't:<br/>

I know our Country disposition well:<br/>

In Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes<br/>

They dare not shew their Husbands.<br/>

Their best Conscience,<br/>

Is not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00459">   Oth. Dost thou say so?<br/>

  Iago. She did deceiue her Father, marrying you,<br/>

And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,<br/>

She lou'd them most<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00460">   Oth. And so she did</p>

<p id="id00461">   Iago. Why go too then:<br/>

Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming<br/>

To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake,<br/>

He thought 'twas Witchcraft.<br/>

But I am much too blame:<br/>

I humbly do beseech you of your pardon<br/>

For too much louing you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00462">   Oth. I am bound to thee for euer</p>

<p id="id00463">   Iago. I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits:<br/>

  Oth. Not a iot, not a iot<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00464">   Iago. Trust me, I feare it has:<br/>

I hope you will consider what is spoke<br/>

Comes from your Loue.<br/>

But I do see y'are moou'd:<br/>

I am to pray you, not to straine my speech<br/>

To grosser issues, nor to larger reach,<br/>

Then to Suspition<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00465">   Oth. I will not</p>

<p id="id00466">   Iago. Should you do so (my Lord)<br/>

My speech should fall into such vilde successe,<br/>

Which my Thoughts aym'd not.<br/>

Cassio's my worthy Friend:<br/>

My Lord, I see y'are mou'd<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00467">   Oth. No, not much mou'd:<br/>

I do not thinke but Desdemona's honest<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00468">   Iago. Long liue she so;<br/>

And long liue you to thinke so<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00469">   Oth. And yet how Nature erring from it selfe</p>

<p id="id00470">   Iago. I, there's the point:<br/>

As (to be bold with you)<br/>

Not to affect many proposed Matches<br/>

Of her owne Clime, Complexion, and Degree,<br/>

Whereto we see in all things, Nature tends:<br/>

Foh, one may smel in such, a will most ranke,<br/>

Foule disproportions, Thoughts vnnaturall.<br/>

But (pardon me) I do not in position<br/>

Distinctly speake of her, though I may feare<br/>

Her will, recoyling to her better iudgement,<br/>

May fal to match you with her Country formes,<br/>

And happily repent<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00471">   Oth. Farewell, farewell:<br/>

If more thou dost perceiue, let me know more:<br/>

Set on thy wife to obserue.<br/>

Leaue me Iago<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00472">   Iago. My Lord, I take my leaue</p>

<p id="id00473">   Othel. Why did I marry?<br/>

This honest Creature (doubtlesse)<br/>

Sees, and knowes more, much more then he vnfolds<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00474">   Iago. My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor<br/>

To scan this thing no farther: Leaue it to time,<br/>

Although 'tis fit that Cassio haue his Place;<br/>

For sure he filles it vp with great Ability;<br/>

Yet if you please, to him off a-while:<br/>

You shall by that perceiue him, and his meanes:<br/>

Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment<br/>

With any strong, or vehement importunitie,<br/>

Much will be seene in that: In the meane time,<br/>

Let me be thought too busie in my feares,<br/>

(As worthy cause I haue to feare I am)<br/>

And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00475">   Oth. Feare not my gouernment</p>

<p id="id00476">   Iago. I once more take my leaue.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00477">  Oth. This Fellow's of exceeding honesty,<br/>

And knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit<br/>

Of humane dealings. If I do proue her Haggard,<br/>

Though that her Iesses were my deere heart-strings,<br/>

I'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde<br/>

To prey at Fortune. Haply, for I am blacke,<br/>

And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation<br/>

That Chamberers haue: Or for I am declin'd<br/>

Into the vale of yeares (yet that's not much)<br/>

Shee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe<br/>

Must be to loath her. Oh Curse of Marriage!<br/>

That we can call these delicate Creatures ours,<br/>

And not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad,<br/>

And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,<br/>

Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue<br/>

For others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great-ones,<br/>

Prerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base,<br/>

'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death:<br/>

Euen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs,<br/>

When we do quicken. Looke where she comes:<br/>

Enter Desdemona and aemilia.<br/>

Your dinner, and the generous Islanders<br/>

By you inuited, do attend your presence<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00480">   Oth. I am too blame</p>

<p id="id00481">   Des. Why do you speake so faintly?<br/>

Are you not well?<br/>

  Oth. I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00482">   Des. Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe.<br/>

Let me but binde it hard, within this houre<br/>

It will be well<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00483">   Oth. Your Napkin is too little:<br/>

Let it alone: Come, Ile go in with you.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00484">  Des. I am very sorry that you are not well.<br/>

Aemil. I am glad I haue found this Napkin:<br/>

This was her first remembrance from the Moore,<br/>

My wayward Husband hath a hundred times<br/>

Woo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token,<br/>

(For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it)<br/>

That she reserues it euermore about her,<br/>

To kisse, and talke too. Ile haue the worke tane out,<br/>

And giu't Iago: what he will do with it<br/>

Heauen knowes, not I:<br/>

I nothing, but to please his Fantasie.<br/>

Enter Iago.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00485">  Iago. How now? What do you heere alone?<br/>

Aemil. Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00486">   Iago. You haue a thing for me?<br/>

It is a common thing-<br/>

Aemil. Hah?<br/>

  Iago. To haue a foolish wife.<br/>

Aemil. Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now<br/>

For that same Handkerchiefe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00487">   Iago. What Handkerchiefe?<br/>

Aemil. What Handkerchiefe?<br/>

Why that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona,<br/>

That which so often you did bid me steale<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00488">   Iago. Hast stolne it from her?<br/>

Aemil. No: but she let it drop by negligence,<br/>

And to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp:<br/>

Looke, heere 'tis<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00489">   Iago. A good wench, giue it me.<br/>

Aemil. What will you do with't, that you haue bene<br/>

so earnest to haue me filch it?<br/>

  Iago. Why, what is that to you?<br/>

Aemil. If it be not for some purpose of import,<br/>

Giu't me againe. Poore Lady, shee'l run mad<br/>

When she shall lacke it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00490">   Iago. Be not acknowne on't:<br/>

I haue vse for it. Go, leaue me.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00491">Exit aemil.</p>

<p id="id00492">I will in Cassio's Lodging loose this Napkin,<br/>

And let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre,<br/>

Are to the iealious, confirmations strong,<br/>

As proofes of holy Writ. This may do something.<br/>

The Moore already changes with my poyson:<br/>

Dangerous conceites, are in their Natures poysons,<br/>

Which at the first are scarse found to distaste:<br/>

But with a little acte vpon the blood,<br/>

Burne like the Mines of Sulphure. I did say so.<br/>

Enter Othello.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00493">Looke where he comes: Not Poppy, nor Mandragora,<br/>

Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world<br/>

Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe<br/>

Which thou owd'st yesterday<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00494">   Oth. Ha, ha, false to mee?<br/>

  Iago. Why how now Generall? No more of that<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00495">   Oth. Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke:<br/>

I sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd,<br/>

Then but to know't a little<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00496">   Iago. How now, my Lord?<br/>

  Oth. What sense had I, in her stolne houres of Lust?<br/>

I saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me:<br/>

I slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie.<br/>

I found not Cassio's kisses on her Lippes:<br/>

He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolne,<br/>

Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00497">   Iago. I am sorry to heare this?<br/>

  Oth. I had beene happy, if the generall Campe,<br/>

Pyoners and all, had tasted her sweet Body,<br/>

So I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer<br/>

Farewell the Tranquill minde; farewell Content;<br/>

Farewell the plumed Troopes, and the bigge Warres,<br/>

That makes Ambition, Vertue! Oh farewell,<br/>

Farewell the neighing Steed, and the shrill Trumpe,<br/>

The Spirit-stirring Drum, th' Eare-piercing Fife,<br/>

The Royall Banner, and all Qualitie,<br/>

Pride, Pompe, and Circumstance of glorious Warre:<br/>

And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates<br/>

Th' immortall Ioues dread Clamours, counterfet,<br/>

Farewell: Othello's Occupation's gone<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00498">   Iago. Is't possible my Lord?<br/>

  Oth. Villaine, be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore;<br/>

Be sure of it: Giue me the Occular proofe,<br/>

Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule,<br/>

Thou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog<br/>

Then answer my wak'd wrath<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00499">   Iago. Is't come to this?<br/>

  Oth. Make me to see't: or (at the least) so proue it,<br/>

That the probation beare no Hindge, nor Loope,<br/>

To hang a doubt on: Or woe vpon thy life<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00500">   Iago. My Noble Lord</p>

<p id="id00501">   Oth. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,<br/>

Neuer pray more: Abandon all remorse<br/>

On Horrors head, Horrors accumulate:<br/>

Do deeds to make Heauen weepe, all Earth amaz'd;<br/>

For nothing canst thou to damnation adde,<br/>

Greater then that<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00502">   Iago. O Grace! O Heauen forgiue me!<br/>

Are you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense?<br/>

God buy you: take mine Office. Oh wretched Foole,<br/>

That lou'st to make thine Honesty, a Vice!<br/>

Oh monstrous world! Take note, take note (O World)<br/>

To be direct and honest, is not safe.<br/>

I thanke you for this profit, and from hence<br/>

Ile loue no Friend, sith Loue breeds such offence<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00503">   Oth. Nay stay: thou should'st be honest</p>

<p id="id00504">   Iago. I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole,<br/>

And looses that it workes for<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00505">   Oth. By the World,<br/>

I thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not:<br/>

I thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not:<br/>

Ile haue some proofe. My name that was as fresh<br/>

As Dians Visage, is now begrim'd and blacke<br/>

As mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues,<br/>

Poyson, or Fire, or suffocating streames,<br/>

Ile not indure it. Would I were satisfied<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00506">   Iago. I see you are eaten vp with Passion:<br/>

I do repent me, that I put it to you.<br/>

You would be satisfied?<br/>

  Oth. Would? Nay, and I will<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00507">   Iago. And may: but how? How satisfied, my Lord?<br/>

Would you the super-vision grossely gape on?<br/>

Behold her top'd?<br/>

  Oth. Death, and damnation. Oh!<br/>

  Iago. It were a tedious difficulty, I thinke,<br/>

To bring them to that Prospect: Damne them then,<br/>

If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster<br/>

More then their owne. What then? How then?<br/>

What shall I say? Where's Satisfaction?<br/>

It is impossible you should see this,<br/>

Were they as prime as Goates, as hot as Monkeyes,<br/>

As salt as Wolues in pride, and Fooles as grosse<br/>

As Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say,<br/>

If imputation, and strong circumstances,<br/>

Which leade directly to the doore of Truth,<br/>

Will giue you satisfaction, you might haue't<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00508">   Oth. Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall</p>

<p id="id00509">   Iago. I do not like the Office.<br/>

But sith I am entred in this cause so farre<br/>

(Prick'd too't by foolish Honesty, and Loue)<br/>

I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,<br/>

And being troubled with a raging tooth,<br/>

I could not sleepe. There are a kinde of men,<br/>

So loose of Soule, that in their sleepes will mutter<br/>

Their Affayres: one of this kinde is Cassio:<br/>

In sleepe I heard him say, sweet Desdemona,<br/>

Let vs be wary, let vs hide our Loues,<br/>

And then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand:<br/>

Cry, oh sweet Creature: then kisse me hard,<br/>

As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes,<br/>

That grew vpon my lippes, laid his Leg ore my Thigh,<br/>

And sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate,<br/>

That gaue thee to the Moore<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00510">   Oth. O monstrous! monstrous!<br/>

  Iago. Nay, this was but his Dreame<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00511">   Oth. But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion,<br/>

'Tis a shrew'd doubt, though it be but a Dreame<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00512">   Iago. And this may helpe to thicken other proofes,<br/>

That do demonstrate thinly<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00513">   Oth. Ile teare her all to peeces</p>

<p id="id00514">   Iago. Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done,<br/>

She may be honest yet: Tell me but this,<br/>

Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe<br/>

Spotted with Strawberries, in your wiues hand?<br/>

  Oth. I gaue her such a one: 'twas my first gift<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00515">   Iago. I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe<br/>

(I am sure it was your wiues) did I to day<br/>

See Cassio wipe his Beard with<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00516">   Oth. If it be that</p>

<p id="id00517">   Iago. If it be that, or any, it was here.<br/>

It speakes against her with the other proofes<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00518">   Othel. O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues:<br/>

One is too poore, too weake for my reuenge.<br/>

Now do I see 'tis true. Looke heere Iago,<br/>

All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone.<br/>

Arise blacke vengeance, from the hollow hell,<br/>

Yeeld vp (O Loue) thy Crowne, and hearted Throne<br/>

To tyrannous Hate. Swell bosome with thy fraught,<br/>

For 'tis of Aspickes tongues<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00519">   Iago. Yet be content</p>

<p id="id00520">   Oth. Oh blood, blood, blood</p>

<p id="id00521">   Iago. Patience I say: your minde may change</p>

<p id="id00522">   Oth. Neuer Iago. Like to the Ponticke Sea,<br/>

Whose Icie Current, and compulsiue course,<br/>

Neu'r keepes retyring ebbe, but keepes due on<br/>

To the Proponticke, and the Hellespont:<br/>

Euen so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace<br/>

Shall neu'r looke backe, neu'r ebbe to humble Loue,<br/>

Till that a capeable, and wide Reuenge<br/>

Swallow them vp. Now by yond Marble Heauen,<br/>

In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow,<br/>

I heere engage my words<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00523">   Iago. Do not rise yet:<br/>

Witnesse you euer-burning Lights aboue,<br/>

You Elements, that clip vs round about,<br/>

Witnesse that heere Iago doth giue vp<br/>

The execution of his wit, hands, heart,<br/>

To wrong'd Othello's Seruice. Let him command,<br/>

And to obey shall be in me remorse,<br/>

What bloody businesse euer<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00524">   Oth. I greet thy loue,<br/>

Not with vaine thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,<br/>

And will vpon the instant put thee too't.<br/>

Within these three dayes let me heare thee say,<br/>

That Cassio's not aliue<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00525">   Iago. My Friend is dead:<br/>

'Tis done at your Request.<br/>

But let her liue<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00526">   Oth. Damne her lewde Minx:<br/>

O damne her, damne her.<br/>

Come go with me a-part, I will withdraw<br/>

To furnish me with some swift meanes of death<br/>

For the faire Diuell.<br/>

Now art thou my Lieutenant<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00527">   Iago. I am your owne for euer.</p>

'tis stabbing<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00533">   Des. Go too: where lodges he?<br/>

  Clo. To tell you where he lodges, is to tel you where<br/>

I lye<br/>

<p id="id00534">   Des. Can any thing be made of this?<br/>

  Clo. I know not where he lodges, and for mee to deuise<br/>

a lodging, and say he lies heere, or he lies there, were<br/>

to lye in mine owne throat<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00535">   Des. Can you enquire him out? and be edified by report?<br/>

  Clo. I will Catechize the world for him, that is, make<br/>

Questions, and by them answer<br/>

Full of Cruzadoes. And but my Noble Moore<br/>

Is true of minde, and made of no such basenesse,<br/>

As iealious Creatures are, it were enough<br/>

To put him to ill-thinking.<br/>

Aemil. Is he not iealious?<br/>

  Des. Who, he? I thinke the Sun where he was borne,<br/>

Drew all such humors from him.<br/>

How do you, Desdemona?<br/>

  Des. Well, my good Lord<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00542">   Oth. Giue me your hand.<br/>

This hand is moist, my Lady<br/>

<p id="id00544">   Oth. This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart:<br/>

Hot, hot, and moyst. This hand of yours requires<br/>

A sequester from Liberty: Fasting, and Prayer,<br/>

Much Castigation, Exercise deuout,<br/>

For heere's a yong, and sweating Diuell heere<br/>

That commonly rebels: 'Tis a good hand,<br/>

A franke one<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00545">   Des. You may (indeed) say so:<br/>

For 'twas that hand that gaue away my heart<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00546">   Oth. A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands:<br/>

But our new Heraldry is hands, not hearts<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00547">   Des. I cannot speake of this:<br/>

Come, now your promise<br/>

<p id="id00548">   Oth. What promise, Chucke?<br/>

  Des. I haue sent to bid Cassio come speake with you<br/>

<p id="id00553">   Oth. Not?<br/>

  Des. No indeed, my Lord<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00554">   Oth. That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe<br/>

Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue:<br/>

She was a Charmer, and could almost read<br/>

The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,<br/>

'T would make her Amiable, and subdue my Father<br/>

Intirely to her loue: But if she lost it,<br/>

Or made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye<br/>

Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt<br/>

After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,<br/>

And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd)<br/>

To giue it her. I did so; and take heede on't,<br/>

Make it a Darling, like your precious eye:<br/>

To loose't, or giue't away, were such perdition,<br/>

As nothing else could match<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00555">   Des. Is't possible?<br/>

  Oth. 'Tis true: There's Magicke in the web of it:<br/>

A Sybill that had numbred in the world<br/>

The Sun to course, two hundred compasses,<br/>

In her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke:<br/>

The Wormes were hallowed, that did breede the Silke,<br/>

And it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull<br/>

Conseru'd of Maidens hearts<br/>

<p id="id00558">   Oth. Say you?<br/>

  Des. It is not lost: but what and if it were?<br/>

  Oth. How?<br/>

<p id="id00559">   Oth. Fetcht, let me see't</p>

<p id="id00560">   Des. Why so I can: but I will not now:<br/>

This is a tricke to put me from my suite,<br/>

Pray you let Cassio be receiu'd againe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00561">   Oth. Fetch me the Handkerchiefe,<br/>

My minde mis-giues<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00562">   Des. Come, come: you'l neuer meete a more sufficient<br/>

man<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00563">   Oth. The Handkerchiefe</p>

<p id="id00564">   Des. A man that all his time<br/>

Hath founded his good Fortunes on your loue;<br/>

Shar'd dangers with you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00565">   Oth. The Handkerchiefe</p>

<p id="id00566">   Des. Insooth, you are too blame</p>

<p id="id00567">   Oth. Away.</p>

<p id="id00568">Exit Othello.</p>

<p id="id00569">Aemil. Is not this man iealious?<br/>

  Des. I neu'r saw this before.<br/>

Sure, there's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe,<br/>

I am most vnhappy in the losse of it.<br/>

Aemil. 'Tis not a yeare or two shewes vs a man:<br/>

They are all but Stomackes, and we all but Food,<br/>

They eate vs hungerly, and when they are full<br/>

They belch vs.<br/>

Enter Iago, and Cassio.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00570">Looke you, Cassio and my Husband</p>

<p id="id00571">   Iago. There is no other way: 'tis she must doo't:<br/>

And loe the happinesse: go, and importune her<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00572">   Des. How now (good Cassio) what's the newes with<br/>

you?<br/>

  Cassio. Madam, my former suite. I do beseech you,<br/>

That by your vertuous meanes, I may againe<br/>

Exist, and be a member of his loue,<br/>

Whom I, with all the Office of my heart<br/>

Intirely honour, I would not be delayd.<br/>

If my offence, be of such mortall kinde,<br/>

That nor my Seruice past, nor present Sorrowes,<br/>

Nor purpos'd merit in futurity,<br/>

Can ransome me into his loue againe,<br/>

But to know so, must be my benefit:<br/>

So shall I cloath me in a forc'd content,<br/>

And shut my selfe vp in some other course<br/>

To Fortunes Almes<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00573">   Des. Alas (thrice-gentle Cassio)<br/>

My Aduocation is not now in Tune;<br/>

My Lord, is not my Lord; nor should I know him,<br/>

Were he in Fauour, as in Humour alter'd.<br/>

So helpe me euery spirit sanctified,<br/>

As I haue spoken for you all my best,<br/>

And stood within the blanke of his displeasure<br/>

For my free speech. You must awhile be patient:<br/>

What I can do, I will: and more I will<br/>

Then for my selfe, I dare. Let that suffice you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00574">   Iago. Is my Lord angry?<br/>

Aemil. He went hence but now:<br/>

And certainly in strange vnquietnesse<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00575">   Iago. Can he be angry? I haue seen the Cannon<br/>

When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre,<br/>

And like the Diuell from his very Arme<br/>

Puff't his owne Brother: And is he angry?<br/>

Something of moment then: I will go meet him,<br/>

There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00576">Exit</p>

<p id="id00577">  Des. I prythee do so. Something sure of State,<br/>

Either from Venice, or some vnhatch'd practise<br/>

Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus, to him,<br/>

Hath pudled his cleare Spirit: and in such cases,<br/>

Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things,<br/>

Though great ones are their obiect. 'Tis euen so.<br/>

For let our finger ake, and it endues<br/>

Our other healthfull members, euen to a sense<br/>

Of paine. Nay, we must thinke men are not Gods,<br/>

Nor of them looke for such obseruancie<br/>

As fits the Bridall. Beshrew me much, aemilia,<br/>

I was (vnhandsome Warrior, as I am)<br/>

Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule:<br/>

But now I finde, I had suborn'd the Witnesse,<br/>

And he's Indited falsely.<br/>

Aemil. Pray heauen it bee<br/>

State matters, as you thinke, and no Conception,<br/>

Nor no Iealious Toy, concerning you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00578">   Des. Alas the day, I neuer gaue him cause.<br/>

Aemil. But Iealious soules will not be answer'd so;<br/>

They are not euer iealious for the cause,<br/>

But iealious, for they're iealious. It is a Monster<br/>

Begot vpon it selfe, borne on it selfe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00579">   Des. Heauen keepe the Monster from Othello's mind.<br/>

Aemil. Lady, Amen<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00580">   Des. I will go seeke him. Cassio, walke heere about:<br/>

If I doe finde him fit, Ile moue your suite,<br/>

And seeke to effect it to my vttermost.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00581">Exit</p>

<p id="id00582">  Cas. I humbly thanke your Ladyship.<br/>

Enter Bianca.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00583">  Bian. 'Saue you (Friend Cassio.)<br/>

  Cassio. What make you from home?<br/>

How is't with you, my most faire Bianca?<br/>

Indeed (sweet Loue) I was comming to your house<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00584">   Bian. And I was going to your Lodging, Cassio.<br/>

What? keepe a weeke away? Seuen dayes, and Nights?<br/>

Eight score eight houres? And Louers absent howres<br/>

More tedious then the Diall, eight score times?<br/>

Oh weary reck'ning<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00585">   Cassio. Pardon me, Bianca:<br/>

I haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest,<br/>

But I shall in a more continuate time<br/>

Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca<br/>

Take me this worke out<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00586">   Bianca. Oh Cassio, whence came this?<br/>

This is some Token from a newer Friend,<br/>

To the felt-Absence: now I feele a Cause:<br/>

Is't come to this? Well, well<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00587">   Cassio. Go too, woman:<br/>

Throw your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth,<br/>

From whence you haue them. You are iealious now,<br/>

That this is from some Mistris, some remembrance;<br/>

No, in good troth Bianca<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00588">   Bian. Why, who's is it?<br/>

  Cassio. I know not neither:<br/>

I found it in my Chamber,<br/>

I like the worke well; Ere it be demanded<br/>

(As like enough it will) I would haue it coppied:<br/>

Take it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00589">   Bian. Leaue you? Wherefore?<br/>

  Cassio. I do attend heere on the Generall,<br/>

And thinke it no addition, nor my wish<br/>

To haue him see me woman'd<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00590">   Bian. Why, I pray you?<br/>

  Cassio. Not that I loue you not<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00591">   Bian. But that you do not loue me.<br/>

I pray you bring me on the way a little,<br/>

And say, if I shall see you soone at night?<br/>

  Cassio. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,<br/>

For I attend heere: But Ile see you soone<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00592">   Bian. 'Tis very good: I must be circumstanc'd.</p>

<p id="id00593">Exeunt. omnes.</p>

<p id="id00594" style="margin-top: 2em">Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.</p>

<p id="id00595">Enter Othello, and Iago.</p>

<p id="id00596">  Iago. Will you thinke so?<br/>

  Oth. Thinke so, Iago?<br/>

  Iago. What, to kisse in priuate?<br/>

  Oth. An vnauthoriz'd kisse?<br/>

  Iago. Or to be naked with her Friend in bed,<br/>

An houre, or more, not meaning any harme?<br/>

  Oth. Naked in bed (Iago) and not meane harme?<br/>

It is hypocrisie against the Diuell:<br/>

They that meane vertuously, and yet do so,<br/>

The Diuell their vertue tempts, and they tempt Heauen<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00597">   Iago. If they do nothing, 'tis a Veniall slip:<br/>

But if I giue my wife a Handkerchiefe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00598">   Oth. What then?<br/>

  Iago. Why then 'tis hers (my Lord) and being hers,<br/>

She may (I thinke) bestow't on any man<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00599">   Oth. She is Protectresse of her honor too:<br/>

May she giue that?<br/>

  Iago. Her honor is an Essence that's not seene,<br/>

They haue it very oft, that haue it not.<br/>

But for the Handkerchiefe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00600">   Othe. By heauen, I would most gladly haue forgot it:<br/>

Thou saidst (oh, it comes ore my memorie,<br/>

As doth the Rauen o're the infectious house:<br/>

Boading to all) he had my Handkerchiefe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00601">   Iago . I: what of that?<br/>

  Othe. That's not so good now<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00602">   Iag. What if I had said, I had seene him do you wrong?<br/>

Or heard him say (as Knaues be such abroad,<br/>

Who hauing by their owne importunate suit,<br/>

Or voluntary dotage of some Mistris,<br/>

Conuinced or supply'd them, cannot chuse<br/>

But they must blab.)<br/>

  Oth. Hath he said any thing?<br/>

  Iago. He hath (my Lord) but be you well assur'd,<br/>

No more then he'le vn-sweare<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00603">   Oth. What hath he said?<br/>

  Iago. Why, that he did: I know not what he did<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00604">   Othe. What? What?<br/>

  Iago. Lye<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00605">   Oth. With her?<br/>

  Iago. With her? On her: what you will<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00606">   Othe. Lye with her? lye on her? We say lye on her,
when they be-lye-her. Lye with her: that's fullsome:
Handkerchiefe: Confessions: Handkerchiefe. To confesse,
and be hang'd for his labour. First, to be hang'd,
and then to confesse: I tremble at it. Nature would not
inuest her selfe in such shadowing passion, without some
Instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish)
Noses, Eares, and Lippes: is't possible. Confesse? Handkerchiefe?
O diuell.</p>

<p id="id00607">Falls in a Traunce.</p>

<p id="id00608">  Iago. Worke on,<br/>

My Medicine workes. Thus credulous Fooles are caught,<br/>

And many worthy, and chast Dames euen thus,<br/>

(All guiltlesse) meete reproach: what hoa? My Lord?<br/>

My Lord, I say: Othello.<br/>

Enter Cassio.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00609">How now Cassio?<br/>

  Cas. What's the matter?<br/>

  Iago. My Lord is falne into an Epilepsie,<br/>

This is his second Fit: he had one yesterday<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00610">   Cas. Rub him about the Temples</p>

<p id="id00611">   Iago. The Lethargie must haue his quyet course:<br/>

If not, he foames at mouth: and by and by<br/>

Breakes out to sauage madnesse. Looke, he stirres:<br/>

Do you withdraw your selfe a little while,<br/>

He will recouer straight: when he is gone,<br/>

I would on great occasion, speake with you.<br/>

How is it Generall? Haue you not hurt your head?<br/>

  Othe. Dost thou mocke me?<br/>

  Iago. I mocke you not, by Heauen:<br/>

Would you would beare your Fortune like a Man<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00612">   Othe. A Horned man's a Monster, and a Beast</p>

<p id="id00613">   Iago. Ther's many a Beast then in a populous Citty,<br/>

And many a ciuill Monster<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00614">   Othe. Did he confesse it?<br/>

  Iago. Good Sir, be a man:<br/>

Thinke euery bearded fellow that's but yoak'd<br/>

May draw with you. There's Millions now aliue,<br/>

That nightly lye in those vnproper beds,<br/>

Which they dare sweare peculiar. Your case is better.<br/>

Oh, 'tis the spight of hell, the Fiends Arch-mock,<br/>

To lip a wanton in a secure Cowch;<br/>

And to suppose her chast. No, let me know,<br/>

And knowing what I am, I know what she shallbe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00615">   Oth. Oh, thou art wise: 'tis certaine</p>

<p id="id00616">   Iago. Stand you a while apart,<br/>

Confine your selfe but in a patient List,<br/>

Whil'st you were heere, o're-whelmed with your griefe<br/>

(A passion most resulting such a man)<br/>

Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,<br/>

And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie,<br/>

Bad him anon returne: and heere speake with me,<br/>

The which he promis'd. Do but encaue your selfe,<br/>

And marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes<br/>

That dwell in euery Region of his face.<br/>

For I will make him tell the Tale anew;<br/>

Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when<br/>

He hath, and is againe to cope your wife.<br/>

I say, but marke his gesture: marry Patience,<br/>

Or I shall say y'are all in all in Spleene,<br/>

And nothing of a man<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00617">   Othe. Do'st thou heare, Iago,<br/>

I will be found most cunning in my Patience:<br/>

But (do'st thou heare) most bloody<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00618">   Iago. That's not amisse,<br/>

But yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw?<br/>

Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<br/>

A Huswife that by selling her desires<br/>

Buyes her selfe Bread, and Cloath. It is a Creature<br/>

That dotes on Cassio, (as 'tis the Strumpets plague<br/>

To be-guile many, and be be-guil'd by one)<br/>

He, when he heares of her, cannot restraine<br/>

From the excesse of Laughter. Heere he comes.<br/>

Enter Cassio.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00619">As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad:<br/>

And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue<br/>

Poore Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behauiours<br/>

Quite in the wrong. How do you Lieutenant?<br/>

  Cas. The worser, that you giue me the addition,<br/>

Whose want euen killes me<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00620">   Iago. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't:<br/>

Now, if this Suit lay in Bianca's dowre,<br/>

How quickely should you speed?<br/>

  Cas. Alas poore Caitiffe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00621">   Oth. Looke how he laughes already</p>

<p id="id00622">   Iago. I neuer knew woman loue man so</p>

<p id="id00623">   Cas. Alas poore Rogue, I thinke indeed she loues me</p>

<p id="id00624">   Oth. Now he denies it faintly: and laughes it out</p>

<p id="id00625">   Iago. Do you heare Cassio?<br/>

  Oth. Now he importunes him<br/>

To tell it o're: go too, well said, well said<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00626">   Iago. She giues it out, that you shall marry her.<br/>

Do you intend it?<br/>

  Cas. Ha, ha, ha<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00627">   Oth. Do ye triumph, Romaine? do you triumph?<br/>

  Cas. I marry. What? A customer; prythee beare<br/>

Some Charitie to my wit, do not thinke it<br/>

So vnwholesome. Ha, ha, ha<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00628">   Oth. So, so, so, so: they laugh, that winnes</p>

<p id="id00629">   Iago. Why the cry goes, that you marry her</p>

<p id="id00630">   Cas. Prythee say true</p>

<p id="id00631">   Iago. I am a very Villaine else</p>

<p id="id00632">   Oth. Haue you scoar'd me? Well</p>

<p id="id00633">   Cas. This is the Monkeys owne giuing out:<br/>

She is perswaded I will marry her<br/>

Out of her owne loue &amp; flattery, not out of my promise<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00634">   Oth. Iago becomes me: now he begins the story</p>

<p id="id00635">   Cassio. She was heere euen now: she haunts me in euery
place. I was the other day talking on the Seabanke
with certaine Venetians, and thither comes the
Bauble, and falls me thus about my neck</p>

<p id="id00636">   Oth. Crying oh deere Cassio, as it were: his iesture imports<br/>

it<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00637">   Cassio. So hangs, and lolls, and weepes vpon me:<br/>

So shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00638">   Oth. Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber:
oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dogge, I
shall throw it to</p>

<p id="id00639">   Cassio. Well, I must leaue her companie</p>

<p id="id00640">   Iago. Before me: looke where she comes.<br/>

Enter Bianca.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00641">  Cas. 'Tis such another Fitchew: marry a perfum'd one?
What do you meane by this haunting of me?
  Bian. Let the diuell, and his dam haunt you: what
did you meane by that same Handkerchiefe, you gaue
me euen now? I was a fine Foole to take it: I must take
out the worke? A likely piece of worke, that you should
finde it in your Chamber, and know not who left it there.
This is some Minxes token, &amp; I must take out the worke?
There, giue it your Hobbey-horse, wheresoeuer you had
it, Ile take out no worke on't</p>

<p id="id00642">   Cassio. How now, my sweete Bianca?<br/>

How now? How now?<br/>

  Othe. By Heauen, that should be my Handkerchiefe<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00643">   Bian. If you'le come to supper to night you may, if<br/>

you will not come when you are next prepar'd for.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00644">Exit</p>

<p id="id00645">  Iago. After her: after her</p>

<p id="id00646">   Cas. I must, shee'l rayle in the streets else</p>

<p id="id00647">   Iago. Will you sup there?<br/>

  Cassio. Yes, I intend so<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00648">   Iago. Well, I may chance to see you: for I would very<br/>

faine speake with you<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00649">   Cas. Prythee come: will you?<br/>

  Iago. Go too; say no more<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00650">   Oth. How shall I murther him, Iago</p>

<p id="id00651">   Iago. Did you perceiue how he laugh'd at his vice?<br/>

  Oth. Oh, Iago<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00652">   Iago. And did you see the Handkerchiefe?<br/>

  Oth. Was that mine?<br/>

  Iago. Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes<br/>

the foolish woman your wife: she gaue it him and, he<br/>

hath giu'n it his whore<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00653">   Oth. I would haue him nine yeeres a killing:<br/>

A fine woman, a faire woman, a sweete woman?<br/>

  Iago. Nay, you must forget that<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00654">   Othello. I, let her rot and perish, and be damn'd to
night, for she shall not liue. No, my heart is turn'd to
stone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand. Oh, the world
hath not a sweeter Creature: she might lye by an Emperours
side, and command him Taskes</p>

<p id="id00655">   Iago. Nay, that's not your way</p>

<p id="id00656">   Othe. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate
with her Needle: an admirable Musitian. Oh she will
sing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare: of so high and plenteous
wit, and inuention?
  Iago. She's the worse for all this</p>

<p id="id00657">   Othe. Oh, a thousand, a thousand times:<br/>

And then of so gentle a condition?<br/>

  Iago. I too gentle<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00658">   Othe. Nay that's certaine:<br/>

But yet the pitty of it, Iago: oh Iago, the pitty of it<br/>

Iago<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00659">   Iago. If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her
pattent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes neere
no body</p>

<p id="id00660">   Oth. I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me?<br/>

  Iago. Oh, 'tis foule in her<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00661">   Oth. With mine Officer?<br/>

  Iago. That's fouler<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00662">   Othe. Get me some poyson, Iago, this night. Ile not
expostulate with her: least her body and beautie vnprouide
my mind againe: this night Iago</p>

<p id="id00663">   Iago. Do it not with poyson, strangle her in her bed,<br/>

Euen the bed she hath contaminated<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00664">   Oth. Good, good:<br/>

The Iustice of it pleases: very good<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00665">   Iago. And for Cassio, let me be his vndertaker:<br/>

You shall heare more by midnight.<br/>

Enter Lodouico, Desdemona, and Attendants.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00666">  Othe. Excellent good: What Trumpet is that same?<br/>

  Iago. I warrant something from Venice,<br/>

'Tis Lodouico, this, comes from the Duke.<br/>

See, your wife's with him<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00667">   Lodo. Saue you worthy Generall</p>

<p id="id00668">   Othe. With all my heart Sir</p>

<p id="id00669">   Lod. The Duke, and the Senators of Venice greet you</p>

<p id="id00670">   Othe. I kisse the Instrument of their pleasures</p>

<p id="id00671">   Des. And what's the newes, good cozen Lodouico<br/>

  Iago. I am very glad to see you Signior:<br/>

Welcome to Cyprus<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00672">   Lod. I thanke you: how do's Lieutenant Cassio?<br/>

  Iago. Liues Sir,<br/>

  Des. Cozen, there's falne betweene him, &amp; my Lord,<br/>

An vnkind breach: but you shall make all well<br/>

<p id="id00673">   Othe. Are you sure of that?<br/>

  Des. My Lord?<br/>

  Othe. This faile you not to do, as you will-<br/>

  Lod. He did not call: he's busie in the paper,<br/>

Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and Cassio?<br/>

  Des. A most vnhappy one: I would do much<br/>

T' attone, them, for the loue I beare to Cassio<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00674">   Oth. Fire, and brimestone</p>

For as I thinke, they do command him home,<br/>

Deputing Cassio in his Gouernment<br/>

Sir, she can turne, and turne: and yet go on<br/>

And turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe.<br/>

And she's obedient: as you say obedient.<br/>

Very obedient: proceed you in your teares.<br/>

Concerning this Sir, (oh well-painted passion)<br/>

I am commanded home: get you away:<br/>

Ile send for you anon. Sir I obey the Mandate,<br/>

And will returne to Venice. Hence, auaunt:<br/>

Cassio shall haue my Place. And Sir, to night<br/>

I do entreat, that we may sup together.<br/>

You are welcome Sir to Cyprus.<br/>

That stroke would proue the worst<br/>

<p id="id00691">   Lod. Is it his vse?<br/>

Or did the Letters, worke vpon his blood,<br/>

And new create his fault?<br/>

  Iago. Alas, alas:<br/>

It is not honestie in me to speake<br/>

What I haue seene, and knowne. You shall obserue him,<br/>

And his owne courses will denote him so,<br/>

That I may saue my speech: do but go after<br/>

All kind of Sores, and Shames on my bare-head:<br/>

Steep'd me in pouertie to the very lippes.<br/>

Giuen to Captiuitie, me, and my vtmost hopes,<br/>

I should haue found in some place of my Soule<br/>

I should make very Forges of my cheekes,<br/>

That would to Cynders burne vp Modestie,<br/>

Heauen stoppes the Nose at it, and the Moone winks:<br/>

I am a Child to chiding<br/>

  Iago. What name, (faire Lady?)<br/>

  Des. Such as she said my Lord did say I was.<br/>

Aemil. He call'd her whore: a Begger in his drinke:<br/>

Could not haue laid such termes vpon his Callet<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00733">   Iago. Why did he so?<br/>

  Des. I do not know: I am sure I am none such<br/>

Her Father? And her Country? And her Friends?<br/>

To be call'd Whore? Would it not make one weepe?<br/>

And hell gnaw his bones.<br/>

Why should he call her Whore?<br/>

Who keepes her companie?<br/>

What Place? What Time?<br/>

What Forme? What liklyhood?<br/>

The Moore's abus'd by some most villanous Knaue,<br/>

Some base notorious Knaue, some scuruy Fellow.<br/>

Oh Heauens, that such companions thou'd'st vnfold,<br/>

And put in euery honest hand a whip<br/>

To lash the Rascalls naked through the world,<br/>

Euen from the East to th' West<br/>

<p id="id00741">   Des. Alas Iago,<br/>

What shall I do to win my Lord againe?<br/>

Good Friend, go to him: for by this light of Heauen,<br/>

I know not how I lost him. Heere I kneele:<br/>

If ere my will did trespasse 'gainst his Loue,<br/>

Either in discourse of thought, or actuall deed,<br/>

Or that mine Eyes, mine Eares, or any Sence<br/>

Delighted them: or any other Forme.<br/>

Or that I do not yet, and euer did,<br/>

And euer will, (though he do shake me off<br/>

To beggerly diuorcement) Loue him deerely,<br/>

Comfort forsweare me. Vnkindnesse may do much,<br/>

And his vnkindnesse may defeat my life,<br/>

But neuer taynt my Loue. I cannot say Whore,<br/>

It do's abhorre me now I speake the word,<br/>

To do the Act, that might the addition earne,<br/>

Not the worlds Masse of vanitie could make me<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00742">   Iago. I pray you be content: 'tis but his humour:<br/>

The businesse of the State do's him offence<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00743">   Des. If 'twere no other</p>

<p id="id00744">   Iago. It is but so, I warrant,<br/>

Hearke how these Instruments summon to supper:<br/>

The Messengers of Venice staies the meate,<br/>

Go in, and weepe not: all things shall be well.<br/>

<p id="id00745">Exeunt. Desdemona and aemilia.</p>

<p id="id00746">Enter Rodorigo.</p>

<p id="id00747">How now Rodorigo?<br/>

  Rod. I do not finde<br/>

That thou deal'st iustly with me<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00748">   Iago. What in the contrarie?
  Rodori. Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise
Iago, and rather, as it seemes to me now, keep'st from
me all conueniencie, then suppliest me with the least aduantage
of hope: I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor
am I yet perswaded to put vp in peace, what already I
haue foolishly suffred</p>

<p id="id00749">   Iago. Will you heare me Rodorigo?<br/>

  Rodori. I haue heard too much: and your words and<br/>

Performances are no kin together<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00750">   Iago. You charge me most vniustly</p>

<p id="id00751">   Rodo. With naught but truth: I haue wasted my
selfe out of my meanes. The Iewels you haue had from
me to deliuer Desdemona, would halfe haue corrupted a
Votarist. You haue told me she hath receiu'd them,
and return'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine
respect, and acquaintance, but I finde none</p>

<p id="id00752">   Iago. Well, go too: very well</p>

<p id="id00753">   Rod. Very well, go too: I cannot go too, (man) nor
'tis not very well. Nay I think it is scuruy: and begin to
finde my selfe fopt in it</p>

<p id="id00754">   Iago. Very well</p>

<p id="id00755">   Rodor. I tell you, 'tis not very well: I will make my
selfe knowne to Desdemona. If she will returne me my
Iewels, I will giue ouer my Suit, and repent my vnlawfull
solicitation. If not, assure your selfe, I will seeke
satisfaction of you</p>

<p id="id00756">   Iago. You haue said now</p>

<p id="id00757" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 4%">   Rodo. I: and said nothing but what I protest intendment
of doing</p>

<p id="id00758">   Iago. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and
euen from this instant do build on thee a better opinion
then euer before: giue me thy hand Rodorigo.
Thou hast taken against me a most iust exception:
but yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy
Affaire</p>

<p id="id00759">   Rod. It hath not appeer'd</p>

<p id="id00760">   Iago. I grant indeed it hath not appeer'd: and
your suspition is not without wit and iudgement.
But Rodorigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which
I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I
meane purpose, Courage, and Valour) this night
shew it. If thou the next night following enioy not
Desdemona, take me from this world with Treacherie,
and deuise Engines for my life</p>

<p id="id00761">   Rod. Well: what is it? Is it within, reason and compasse?<br/>

  Iago. Sir, there is especiall Commission come from<br/>

Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00762">   Rod. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona<br/>

returne againe to Venice<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00763">   Iago. Oh no: he goes into Mauritania and taketh
away with him the faire Desdemona, vnlesse his abode
be lingred heere by some accident. Wherein
none can be so determinate, as the remouing of
Cassio</p>

<p id="id00764">   Rod. How do you meane remouing him?<br/>

  Iago. Why, by making him vncapable of Othello's<br/>

place: knocking out his braines<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00765">   Rod. And that you would haue me to do</p>

<p id="id00766">   Iago. I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a
right. He sups to night with a Harlotry: and thither
will I go to him. He knowes not yet of his Honourable
Fortune, if you will watch his going thence (which
I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one)
you may take him at your pleasure. I will be neere
to second your Attempt, and he shall fall betweene
vs. Come, stand not amaz'd at it, but go along with
me: I will shew you such a necessitie in his death, that
you shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him. It
is now high supper time: and the night growes to wast.
About it</p>

<p id="id00767">   Rod. I will heare further reason for this</p>

<p id="id00768">   Iago. And you shalbe satisfi'd.</p>

<p id="id00793">   Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world?<br/>

Aemil. The world's a huge thing:<br/>

It is a great price, for a small vice<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00794">   Des. Introth, I thinke thou would'st not.
Aemil. Introth I thinke I should, and vndoo't when
I had done. Marry, I would not doe such a thing for a
ioynt Ring, nor for measures of Lawne, nor for Gownes,
Petticoats, nor Caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for
all the whole world: why, who would not make her husband
a Cuckold, to make him a Monarch? I should venture
Purgatory for't</p>

<p id="id00795">   Des. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world.
Aemil. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i'th' world;
and hauing the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in
your owne world, and you might quickly make it right</p>

<p id="id00796">   Des. I do not thinke there is any such woman.<br/>

Aemil. Yes, a dozen: and as many to'th' vantage, as<br/>

would store the world they plaid for.<br/>

But I do thinke it is their Husbands faults<br/>

If Wiues do fall: (Say, that they slacke their duties,<br/>

And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps;<br/>

Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies,<br/>

Throwing restraint vpon vs: Or say they strike vs,<br/>

Or scant our former hauing in despight)<br/>

Why we haue galles: and though we haue some Grace,<br/>

Yet haue we some Reuenge. Let Husbands know,<br/>

Their wiues haue sense like them: They see, and smell,<br/>

And haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre,<br/>

As Husbands haue. What is it that they do,<br/>

When they change vs for others? Is it Sport?<br/>

I thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it?<br/>

I thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres?<br/>

It is so too. And haue not we Affections?<br/>

Desires for Sport? and Frailty, as men haue?<br/>

Then let them vse vs well: else let them know,<br/>

The illes we do, their illes instruct vs so<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00797">   Des. Good night, good night:<br/>

Heauen me such vses send,<br/>

Not to picke bad, from bad; but by bad, mend.<br/>

He calles me to a restitution large<br/>

Of Gold, and Iewels, that I bob'd from him,<br/>

As Guifts to Desdemona.<br/>

It must not be: If Cassio do remaine,<br/>

He hath a dayly beauty in his life,<br/>

That makes me vgly: and besides, the Moore<br/>

May vnfold me to him: there stand I in much perill:<br/>

No, he must dye. But so, I heard him comming.<br/>

Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,<br/>

And loue thee after. One more, and that's the last.<br/>

So sweet, was ne're so fatall. I must weepe,<br/>

<p id="id00916">   Oth. She was false as water.<br/>

Aemil. Thou art rash as fire, to say<br/>

That she was false. Oh she was heauenly true<br/>

<p id="id00917">   Oth. Cassio did top her: Ask thy husband else.<br/>

O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell:<br/>

But that I did proceed vpon iust grounds<br/>

To this extremity. Thy Husband knew it all.<br/>

An honest man he is, and hates the slime<br/>

That stickes on filthy deeds.<br/>

Aemil. My Husband?<br/>

  Oth. What needs this itterance, Woman?<br/>

I say, thy Husband.<br/>

Aemil. Oh Mistris,<br/>

Villany hath made mockes with loue:<br/>

  Oth. He, Woman;<br/>

I say thy Husband: Do'st vnderstand the word?<br/>

My Friend, thy Husband; honest, honest Iago.<br/>

Aemil. If he say so, may his pernicious Soule<br/>

Rot halfe a graine a day: he lyes to'th' heart,<br/>

She was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine<br/>

<p id="id00918">   Oth. Hah?<br/>

Aemil. Do thy worst:<br/>

This deede of thine is no more worthy Heauen,<br/>

Then thou was't worthy her<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00919">   Oth. Peace, you were best.<br/>

Aemil. Thou hast not halfe that powre to do me harm,<br/>

As I haue to be hurt. Oh Gull, oh dolt,<br/>

As ignorant as durt: thou hast done a deed<br/>

(I care not for thy Sword) Ile make thee known,<br/>

Though I lost twenty liues. Helpe, helpe, hoa, helpe:<br/>

The Moore hath kill'd my Mistris. Murther, murther.<br/>

Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00920">  Mon. What is the matter? How now Generall?<br/>

Aemil. Oh, are you come, Iago: you haue done well,<br/>

That men must lay their Murthers on your necke<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00921">   Gra. What is the matter?<br/>

Aemil. Disproue this Villaine, if thou bee'st a man:<br/>

He sayes, thou told'st him that his wife was false:<br/>

I know thou did'st not: thou'rt not such a Villain.<br/>

Speake, for my heart is full<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00922">   Iago. I told him what I thought,<br/>

And told no more<br/>

Then what he found himselfe was apt, and true.<br/>

Aemil. But did you euer tell him,<br/>

She was false?<br/>

  Iago. I did.<br/>

Aemil. You told a Lye an odious damned Lye:<br/>

Vpon my Soule, a Lye; a wicked Lye.<br/>

Shee false with Cassio?<br/>

Did you say with Cassio?<br/>

  Iago. With Cassio, Mistris?<br/>

Go too, charme your tongue<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00923">   Emil. I will not charme my Tongue;<br/>

I am bound to speake,<br/>

My Mistris heere lyes murthered in her bed<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00924">   All. Oh Heauens, forefend</p>

<p id="id00925">   Emil. And your reports haue set the Murder on</p>

<p id="id00926">   Othello. Nay stare not Masters,<br/>

It is true indeede<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00927">   Gra. 'Tis a strange Truth</p>

<p id="id00928">   Mont. O monstrous Acte</p>

<p id="id00929">   Emil. Villany, villany, villany:<br/>

I thinke vpon't, I thinke: I smel't: O Villany:<br/>

I thought so then: Ile kill my selfe for greefe.<br/>

O villany! villany!<br/>

  Iago. What, are you mad?<br/>

I charge you get you home<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00930">   Emil. Good Gentlemen, let me haue leaue to speake:<br/>

'Tis proper I obey him; but not now:<br/>

Perchance Iago, I will ne're go home<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00931">   Oth. Oh, oh, oh</p>

<p id="id00932">   Emil. Nay, lay thee downe, and roare:<br/>

For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent,<br/>

That ere did lift vp eye<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00933">   Oth. Oh she was fowle!<br/>

I scarse did know you Vnkle, there lies your Neece,<br/>

Whose breath (indeed) these hands haue newly stopp'd:<br/>

I know this acte shewes horrible and grim<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00934">   Gra. Poore Desdemon:<br/>

I am glad thy Father's dead,<br/>

Thy Match was mortall to him: and pure greefe<br/>

Shore his old thred in twaine. Did he liue now,<br/>

This sight would make him do a desperate turne:<br/>

Yea, curse his better Angell from his side,<br/>

And fall to Reprobance<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00935">   Oth. 'Tis pittifull: but yet Iago knowes<br/>

That she with Cassio, hath the Act of shame<br/>

A thousand times committed. Cassio confest it,<br/>

And she did gratifie his amorous workes<br/>

With that Recognizance and pledge of Loue<br/>

Which I first gaue her: I saw it in his hand:<br/>

It was a Handkerchiefe, an Antique Token<br/>

My Father gaue my Mother<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00936">   Emil. Oh Heauen! oh heauenly Powres!<br/>

  Iago. Come, hold your peace<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00937">   Emil. 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace?<br/>

No, I will speake as liberall as the North;<br/>

Let Heauen, and Men, and Diuels, let them all,<br/>

All, all, crie shame against me, yet Ile speake<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00938">   Iago. Be wise, and get you home</p>

<p id="id00939">   Emil. I will not</p>

<p id="id00940">   Gra. Fye, your Sword vpon a Woman</p>

<p id="id00941">   Emil. Oh thou dull Moore,<br/>

That Handkerchiefe thou speak'st of<br/>

I found by Fortune, and did giue my Husband:<br/>

For often, with a solemne earnestnesse,<br/>

(More then indeed belong'd to such a Trifle)<br/>

He begg'd of me, to steale't<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00942">   Iago. Villanous Whore</p>

<p id="id00943">   Emil. She giue it Cassio? No, alas I found it,<br/>

And I did giu't my Husband<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00944">   Iago. Filth, thou lyest</p>

<p id="id00945">   Emil. By Heauen I do not, I do not Gentlemen:<br/>

Oh murd'rous Coxcombe, what should such a Foole<br/>

Do with so good a wife?<br/>

  Oth. Are there no stones in Heauen,<br/>

But what serues for the Thunder?<br/>

Precious Villaine<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00946">   Gra. The woman falles:<br/>

Sure he hath kill'd his Wife<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00947">   Emil. I, I: oh lay me by my Mistris side</p>

<p id="id00948">   Gra. Hee's gone, but his wife's kill'd</p>

<p id="id00949">   Mon. 'Tis a notorious Villain: take you this weapon<br/>

Which I haue recouer'd from the Moore:<br/>

Come guard the doore without, let him not passe,<br/>

But kill him rather. Ile after that same villaine,<br/>

For 'tis a damned Slaue.<br/>

Enter.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00950">  Oth. I am not valiant neither:<br/>

But euery Punie whipster gets my Sword.<br/>

But why should Honor out-liue Honesty?<br/>

Let it go all.<br/>

Aemil. What did thy Song boad Lady?<br/>

Hearke, canst thou heare me? I will play the Swan,<br/>

And dye in Musicke: Willough, Willough, Willough.<br/>

Moore, she was chaste: She lou'd thee, cruell Moore,<br/>

So come my Soule to blisse, as I speake true:<br/>

So speaking as I thinke, alas, I dye<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00951">   Oth. I haue another weapon in this Chamber,<br/>

It was a Sword of Spaine, the Ice brookes temper:<br/>

Oh heere it is: Vnkle I must come forth<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00952">   Gra. If thou attempt it, it will cost thee deere;<br/>

Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00953">   Oth. Looke in vpon me then, and speake with me,<br/>

Or naked as I am I will assault thee<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00954">   Gra. What is the matter?<br/>

  Othel. Behold, I haue a weapon:<br/>

A better neuer did it selfe sustaine<br/>

Vpon a Soldiers Thigh. I haue seene the day,<br/>

That with this little Arme, and this good Sword,<br/>

I haue made my way through more impediments<br/>

Then twenty times your stop. But (oh vaine boast)<br/>

Who can controll his Fate? 'Tis not so now.<br/>

Be not affraid, though you do see me weapon'd:<br/>

Heere is my iournies end, heere is my butt<br/>

And verie Sea-marke of my vtmost Saile.<br/>

Do you go backe dismaid? 'Tis a lost feare:<br/>

Man but a Rush against Othello's brest,<br/>

And he retires. Where should Othello go?<br/>

Now: how dost thou looke now? Oh ill-Starr'd wench,<br/>

Pale as thy Smocke: when we shall meete at compt,<br/>

This looke of thine will hurle my Soule from Heauen,<br/>

And Fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my Girle?<br/>

Euen like thy Chastity. O cursed, cursed Slaue!<br/>

Whip me ye Diuels,<br/>

From the possession of this Heauenly sight:<br/>

Blow me about in windes, roast me in Sulphure,<br/>

Wash me in steepe-downe gulfes of Liquid fire.<br/>

Oh Desdemon! dead Desdemon: dead. Oh, oh!<br/>

Enter Lodouico, Cassio, Montano, and Iago, with Officers.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00955">  Lod. Where is this rash, and most vnfortunate man?<br/>

  Oth. That's he that was Othello: heere I am<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00956">   Lod. Where is that Viper?<br/>

Bring the Villaine forth<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00957">   Oth. I look down towards his feet; but that's a Fable,<br/>

If that thou bee'st a Diuell, I cannot kill thee<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00958">   Lod. Wrench his Sword from him</p>

<p id="id00959">   Iago. I bleed Sir, but not kill'd</p>

<p id="id00960">   Othel. I am not sorry neither, Il'd haue thee liue:<br/>

For in my sense, 'tis happinesse to die<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00961">   Lod. Oh thou Othello, that was once so good,<br/>

Falne in the practise of a cursed Slaue,<br/>

What shall be saide to thee<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00962">   Oth. Why any thing:<br/>

An honourable Murderer, if you will:<br/>

For nought I did in hate, but all in Honour<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00963">   Lod. This wretch hath part confest his Villany:<br/>

Did you and he consent in Cassio's death<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00964">   Oth. I</p>

<p id="id00965">   Cas. Deere Generall, I neuer gaue you cause</p>

<p id="id00966">   Oth. I do beleeue it, and I aske your pardon:<br/>

Will you, I pray, demand that demy-Diuell,<br/>

Why he hath thus ensnar'd my Soule and Body<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00967">   Iag. Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:<br/>

From this time forth, I neuer will speake word<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00968">   Lod. What? not to pray?<br/>

  Gra. Torments will ope your lips<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00969">   Oth. Well, thou dost best</p>

<p id="id00970">   Lod. Sir,<br/>

You shall vnderstand what hath befalne,<br/>

(Which, as I thinke, you know not) heere is a Letter<br/>

Found in the pocket of the slaine Rodorigo,<br/>

And heere another, the one of them imports<br/>

The death of Cassio, to be vndertooke<br/>

By Rodorigo<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00971">   Oth. O Villaine!<br/>

  Cassio. Most Heathenish, and most grosse<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00972">   Lod. Now, heere's another discontented paper<br/>

Found in his pocket too: and this it seemes<br/>

Rodorigo meant t'haue sent this damned villaine:<br/>

But that (belike) Iago in the interim<br/>

Came in, and satisfi'd him<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00973">   Oth. Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe;<br/>

How came you (Cassio) by that Handkerchiefe<br/>

That was my wiues?<br/>

  Cassio. I found it in my Chamber:<br/>

And he himselfe confest it but euen now,<br/>

That there he dropt it for a speciall purpose,<br/>

Which wrought to his desire<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00974">   Othel. O Foole, foole, foole!<br/>

  Cassio. There is besides, in Rodorigo's Letter,<br/>

How he vpbraides Iago, that he made him<br/>

Braue me vpon the Watch: whereon it came<br/>

That I was cast: and euen but now he spake<br/>

(After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him,<br/>

Iago set him on<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00975">   Lod. You must forsake this roome, and go with vs:<br/>

Your Power, and your Command is taken off,<br/>

And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this Slaue,<br/>

If there be any cunning Crueltie,<br/>

That can torment him much, and hold him long,<br/>

It shall be his. You shall close Prisoner rest,<br/>

Till that the Nature of your fault be knowne<br/>

To the Venetian State. Come, bring away<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00976">   Oth. Soft you; a word or two before you goe:<br/>

I haue done the State some seruice, and they know't:<br/>

No more of that. I pray you in your Letters,<br/>

When you shall these vnluckie deeds relate,<br/>

Speake of me, as I am. Nothing extenuate,<br/>

Nor set downe ought in malice.<br/>

Then must you speake,<br/>

Of one that lou'd not wisely, but too well:<br/>

Of one, not easily Iealious, but being wrought,<br/>

Perplexed in the extreame: Of one, whose hand<br/>

(Like the base Iudean) threw a Pearle away<br/>

Richer then all his Tribe: Of one, whose subdu'd Eyes,<br/>

Albeit vn-vsed to the melting moode,<br/>

Drops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees<br/>

Their Medicinable gumme. Set you downe this:<br/>

And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br/>

Where a malignant, and a Turbond-Turke<br/>

Beate a Venetian, and traduc'd the State,<br/>

I tooke by th' throat the circumcised Dogge,<br/>

And smoate him, thus<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00977">   Lod. Oh bloody period</p>

<p id="id00978">   Gra. All that is spoke, is marr'd</p>

<p id="id00979">   Oth. I kist thee, ere I kill'd thee: No way but this,<br/>

Killing my selfe, to dye vpon a kisse.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00980">Dyes</p>

<p id="id00981">  Cas. This did I feare, but thought he had no weapon:<br/>

For he was great of heart<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00982">   Lod. Oh Sparton Dogge:<br/>

More fell then Anguish, Hunger, or the Sea:<br/>

Looke on the Tragicke Loading of this bed:<br/>

This is thy worke:<br/>

The Obiect poysons Sight,<br/>

Let it be hid. Gratiano, keepe the house,<br/>

And seize vpon the Fortunes of the Moore,<br/>

For they succeede on you. To you, Lord Gouernor,<br/>

Remaines the Censure of this hellish villaine:<br/>

The Time, the Place, the Torture, oh inforce it:<br/>

My selfe will straight aboord, and to the State,<br/>
