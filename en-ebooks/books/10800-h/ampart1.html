<h3>THE FIRST SECTION, MEMBER, SUBSECTION.</h3>
<h4><i>Man's Excellency, Fall, Miseries, Infirmities; The causes of them</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Man's Excellency</i>.] Man the most excellent and noble creature of the
world, <q>the principal and mighty work of God, wonder of Nature,</q> as
Zoroaster calls him; <span lang="la">audacis naturae miraculum</span>, <q>the <a href="#note820">[820]</a>marvel of
marvels,</q> as Plato; <q>the <a href="#note821">[821]</a>abridgment and epitome of the world,</q> as
Pliny; <span lang="la">microcosmus</span>, a little world, a model of the world, <a href="#note822">[822]</a>sovereign
lord of the earth, viceroy of the world, sole commander and governor of all
the creatures in it; to whose empire they are subject in particular, and
yield obedience; far surpassing all the rest, not in body only, but in
soul; <a href="#note823">[823]</a><span lang="la">imaginis imago</span>, <a href="#note824">[824]</a>created to God's own <a href="#note825">[825]</a>image, to that
immortal and incorporeal substance, with all the faculties and powers
belonging unto it; was at first pure, divine, perfect, happy, <a href="#note826">[826]</a>
<q>created after God in true holiness and righteousness;</q> <span lang="la">Deo congruens</span>,
free from all manner of infirmities, and put in Paradise, to know God, to
praise and glorify him, to do his will, <span lang="la">Ut diis consimiles parturiat deos</span>
(as an old poet saith) to propagate the church.

<p><i>Man's Fall and Misery</i>.] But this most noble creature, <span lang="la">Heu tristis, et
lachrymosa commutatio</span> (<a href="#note827">[827]</a>one exclaims) O pitiful change! is fallen
from that he was, and forfeited his estate, become <span lang="la">miserabilis homuncio</span>,
a castaway, a caitiff, one of the most miserable creatures of the world,
if he be considered in his own nature, an unregenerate man, and so much
obscured by his fall that (some few relics excepted) he is inferior to a
beast, <a href="#note828">[828]</a><q>Man in honour that understandeth not, is like unto beasts
that perish,</q> so David esteems him: a monster by stupend metamorphoses,
<a href="#note829">[829]</a>a fox, a dog, a hog, what not? <span lang="la">Quantum mutatus ab illo</span>? How much
altered from that he was; before blessed and happy, now miserable and
accursed; <a href="#note830">[830]</a><q>He must eat his meat in sorrow,</q> subject to death and all
manner of infirmities, all kind of calamities.

<p><i>A Description of Melancholy</i>.] <a href="#note831">[831]</a><q>Great travail is created for all men,
and an heavy yoke on the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of
their mother's womb, unto that day they return to the mother of all things.
Namely, their thoughts, and fear of their hearts, and their imagination of
things they wait for, and the day of death. From him that sitteth in the
glorious throne, to him that sitteth beneath in the earth and ashes; from
him that is clothed in blue silk and weareth a crown, to him that is
clothed in simple linen. Wrath, envy, trouble, and unquietness, and fear of
death, and rigour, and strife, and such things come to both man and beast,
but sevenfold to the ungodly.</q> All this befalls him in this life, and
peradventure eternal misery in the life to come.

<p><i>Impulsive Cause of Man's Misery and Infirmities</i>.] The impulsive cause of
these miseries in man, this privation or destruction of God's image, the
cause of death and diseases, of all temporal and eternal punishments, was
the sin of our first parent Adam, <a href="#note832">[832]</a>in eating of the forbidden fruit,
by the devil's instigation and allurement. His disobedience, pride,
ambition, intemperance, incredulity, curiosity; from whence proceeded
original sin, and that general corruption of mankind, as from a fountain,
flowed all bad inclinations and actual transgressions which cause our
several calamities inflicted upon us for our sins. And this belike is that
which our fabulous poets have shadowed unto us in the tale of <a href="#note833">[833]</a>
Pandora's box, which being opened through her curiosity, filled the world
full of all manner of diseases. It is not curiosity alone, but those other
crying sins of ours, which pull these several plagues and miseries upon our
heads. For <span lang="la">Ubi peccatum, ibi procella</span>, as <a href="#note834">[834]</a>Chrysostom well observes.
<a href="#note835">[835]</a><q>Fools by reason of their transgression, and because of their
iniquities, are afflicted.</q> <a href="#note836">[836]</a><q>Fear cometh like sudden desolation, and
destruction like a whirlwind, affliction and anguish,</q> because they did not
fear God. <a href="#note837">[837]</a><q>Are you shaken with wars?</q> as Cyprian well urgeth to
Demetrius, <q>are you molested with dearth and famine? is your health crushed
with raging diseases? is mankind generally tormented with epidemical
maladies? 'tis all for your sins,</q> <span class="bibcite">Hag. i. 9, 10</span>; <span class="bibcite">Amos i.</span>; <span class="bibcite">Jer. vii.</span> God is
angry, punisheth and threateneth, because of their obstinacy and
stubbornness, they will not turn unto him. <a href="#note838">[838]</a><q>If the earth be barren
then for want of rain, if dry and squalid, it yield no fruit, if your
fountains be dried up, your wine, corn, and oil blasted, if the air be
corrupted, and men troubled with diseases, 'tis by reason of their sins:</q>
which like the blood of Abel cry loud to heaven for vengeance, <span class="bibcite">Lam. v. 15</span>.
<q>That we have sinned, therefore our hearts are heavy,</q> <span class="bibcite">Isa. lix. 11, 12</span>.
<q>We roar like bears, and mourn like doves, and want health, &amp;c. for our
sins and trespasses.</q> But this we cannot endure to hear or to take notice
of, <span class="bibcite">Jer. ii. 30</span>. <q>We are smitten in vain and receive no correction;</q> and
<span class="bibcite">cap. v. 3</span>. <q>Thou hast stricken them, but they have not sorrowed; they have
refused to receive correction; they have not returned. Pestilence he hath
sent, but they have not turned to him,</q> <span class="bibcite">Amos iv.</span> <a href="#note839">[839]</a>Herod could not
abide John Baptist, nor <a href="#note840">[840]</a>Domitian endure Apollonius to tell the causes
of the plague at Ephesus, his injustice, incest, adultery, and the like.

<p>To punish therefore this blindness and obstinacy of ours as a concomitant
cause and principal agent, is God's just judgment in bringing these
calamities upon us, to chastise us, I say, for our sins, and to satisfy
God's wrath. For the law requires obedience or punishment, as you may read
at large, <span class="bibcite">Deut. xxviii. 15</span>. <q>If they will not obey the Lord, and keep his
commandments and ordinances, then all these curses shall come upon them.</q>
<a href="#note841">[841]</a><q>Cursed in the town and in the field, &amp;c.</q> <a href="#note842">[842]</a><q>Cursed in the fruit
of the body, &amp;c.</q> <a href="#note843">[843]</a><q>The Lord shall send thee trouble and shame,
because of thy wickedness.</q> And a little after, <a href="#note844">[844]</a><q>The Lord shall smite
thee with the botch of Egypt, and with emerods, and scab, and itch, and thou
canst not be healed; <a href="#note845">[845]</a>with madness, blindness, and astonishing of
heart.</q> This Paul seconds, <span class="bibcite">Rom. ii. 9</span>. <q>Tribulation and anguish on the soul
of every man that doeth evil.</q> Or else these chastisements are inflicted
upon us for our humiliation, to exercise and try our patience here in this
life to bring us home, to make us to know God ourselves, to inform and
teach us wisdom. <a href="#note846">[846]</a><q>Therefore is my people gone into captivity, because
they had no knowledge; therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against
his people, and he hath stretched out his hand upon them.</q> He is desirous
of our salvation. <a href="#note847">[847]</a><span lang="la">Nostrae salutis avidus</span>, saith Lemnius, and for
that cause pulls us by the ear many times, to put us in mind of our duties:
<q>That they which erred might have understanding, (as Isaiah speaks xxix.
24) and so to be reformed.</q> <a href="#note848">[848]</a><q>I am afflicted, and at the point of
death,</q> so David confesseth of himself, <span class="bibcite">Psal. lxxxviii. v. 15, v. 9</span>. <q>Mine
eyes are sorrowful through mine affliction:</q> and that made him turn unto
God. Great Alexander in the midst of all his prosperity, by a company of
parasites deified, and now made a god, when he saw one of his wounds bleed,
remembered that he was but a man, and remitted of his pride. <span lang="la">In morbo
recolligit se animus</span>,<a href="#note849">[849]</a>as <a href="#note850">[850]</a>Pliny well perceived; <q>In sickness the
mind reflects upon itself, with judgment surveys itself, and abhors its
former courses;</q> insomuch that he concludes to his friend Marius,<a href="#note851">[851]</a>
<q>that it were the period of all philosophy, if we could so continue sound,
or perform but a part of that which we promised to do, being sick. Whoso is
wise then, will consider these things,</q> as David did (<span class="bibcite">Psal. cxliv., verse
last</span>); and whatsoever fortune befall him, make use of it. If he be in
sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity, seriously to recount with
himself, why this or that malady, misery, this or that incurable disease is
inflicted upon him; it may be for his good, <a href="#note852">[852]</a><span lang="la">sic expedit</span> as Peter
said of his daughter's ague. Bodily sickness is for his soul's health,
<span lang="la">periisset nisi periisset</span>, had he not been visited, he had utterly
perished; for <a href="#note853">[853]</a><q>the Lord correcteth him whom he loveth, even as a
father doth his child in whom he delighteth.</q> If he be safe and sound on
the other side, and free from all manner of infirmity; <a href="#note854">[854]</a><span lang="la">et cui</span>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Gratia, forma, valetudo contingat abunde</div>
<div class="line">Et mundus victus, non deficiente crumena.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">And that he have grace, beauty, favour, health,</div>
<div class="line">A cleanly diet, and abound in wealth.</div>
</div>
<p>Yet in the midst of his prosperity, let him remember that caveat of Moses,
<a href="#note855">[855]</a><q>Beware that he do not forget the Lord his God;</q> that he be not
puffed up, but acknowledge them to be his good gifts and benefits, and
<a href="#note856">[856]</a><q>the more he hath, to be more thankful,</q> (as Agapetianus adviseth)
and use them aright.

<p><i>Instrumental Causes of our Infirmities</i>.] Now the instrumental causes of
these our infirmities, are as diverse as the infirmities themselves; stars,
heavens, elements, &amp;c. And all those creatures which God hath made, are
armed against sinners. They were indeed once good in themselves, and that
they are now many of them pernicious unto us, is not in their nature, but
our corruption, which hath caused it. For from the fall of our first parent
Adam, they have been changed, the earth accursed, the influence of stars,
altered, the four elements, beasts, birds, plants, are now ready to offend
us. <q>The principal things for the use of man, are water, fire, iron, salt,
meal, wheat, honey, milk, oil, wine, clothing, good to the godly, to the
sinners turned to evil,</q> <span class="bibcite">Ecclus. xxxix. 26</span>. <q>Fire, and hail, and famine,
and dearth, all these are created for vengeance,</q> <span class="bibcite">Ecclus. xxxix. 29</span>. The
heavens threaten us with their comets, stars, planets, with their great
conjunctions, eclipses, oppositions, quartiles, and such unfriendly
aspects. The air with his meteors, thunder and lightning, intemperate heat
and cold, mighty winds, tempests, unseasonable weather; from which proceed
dearth, famine, plague, and all sorts of epidemical diseases, consuming
infinite myriads of men. At Cairo in Egypt, every third year, (as it is
related by <a href="#note857">[857]</a>Boterus, and others) 300,000 die of the plague; and
200,000, in Constantinople, every fifth or seventh at the utmost. How doth
the earth terrify and oppress us with terrible earthquakes, which are most
frequent in <a href="#note858">[858]</a>China, Japan, and those eastern climes, swallowing up
sometimes six cities at once? How doth the water rage with his inundations,
irruptions, flinging down towns, cities, villages, bridges, &amp;c. besides
shipwrecks; whole islands are sometimes suddenly overwhelmed with all their
inhabitants in <a href="#note859">[859]</a>Zealand, Holland, and many parts of the continent
drowned, as the <a href="#note860">[860]</a>lake Erne in Ireland? <a href="#note861">[861]</a><span lang="la">Nihilque praeter arcium
cadavera patenti cernimus freto.</span> In the fens of Friesland 1230, by reason
of tempests, <a href="#note862">[862]</a>the sea drowned <span lang="la">multa hominum millia, et jumenta sine
numero</span>, all the country almost, men and cattle in it. How doth the fire
rage, that merciless element, consuming in an instant whole cities? What
town of any antiquity or note hath not been once, again and again, by the
fury of this merciless element, defaced, ruinated, and left desolate? In a
word,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note863">[863]</a>Ignis pepercit, unda mergit, aeris</div>
<div class="line">Vis pestilentis aequori ereptum necat,</div>
<div class="line">Bello superstes, tabidus morbo perit.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Whom fire spares, sea doth drown; whom sea,</div>
<div class="line">Pestilent air doth send to clay;</div>
<div class="line">Whom war 'scapes, sickness takes away.</div>
</div>
<p>To descend to more particulars, how many creatures are at deadly feud with
men? Lions, wolves, bears, &amp;c. Some with hoofs, horns, tusks, teeth, nails:
How many noxious serpents and venomous creatures, ready to offend us with
stings, breath, sight, or quite kill us? How many pernicious fishes,
plants, gums, fruits, seeds, flowers, &amp;c. could I reckon up on a sudden,
which by their very smell many of them, touch, taste, cause some grievous
malady, if not death itself? Some make mention of a thousand several
poisons: but these are but trifles in respect. The greatest enemy to man,
is man, who by the devil's instigation is still ready to do mischief, his
own executioner, a wolf, a devil to himself, and others. <a href="#note864">[864]</a>We are all
brethren in Christ, or at least should be, members of one body, servants of
one lord, and yet no fiend can so torment, insult over, tyrannise, vex, as
one man doth another. Let me not fall therefore (saith David, when wars,
plague, famine were offered) into the hands of men, merciless and wicked
men:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note865">[865]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Vix sunt homines hoc nomine digni,</div>
<div class="line">Quamque lupi, saevae plus feritatis habent.</div>
</div>
<p>We can most part foresee these epidemical diseases, and likely avoid them;
Dearths, tempests, plagues, our astrologers foretell us; Earthquakes,
inundations, ruins of houses, consuming fires, come by little and little,
or make some noise beforehand; but the knaveries, impostures, injuries and
villainies of men no art can avoid. We can keep our professed enemies from
our cities, by gates, walls and towers, defend ourselves from thieves and
robbers by watchfulness and weapons; but this malice of men, and their
pernicious endeavours, no caution can divert, no vigilancy foresee, we have
so many secret plots and devices to mischief one another.

<p>Sometimes by the devil's help as magicians, <a href="#note866">[866]</a>witches: sometimes by
impostures, mixtures, poisons, stratagems, single combats, wars, we hack
and hew, as if we were <span lang="la">ad internecionem nati</span>, like Cadmus' soldiers born
to consume one another. 'Tis an ordinary thing to read of a hundred and two
hundred thousand men slain in a battle. Besides all manner of tortures,
brazen bulls, racks, wheels, strappadoes, guns, engines, &amp;c. <a href="#note867">[867]</a><span lang="la">Ad unum
corpus humanum supplicia plura, quam membra</span>: We have invented more
torturing instruments, than there be several members in a man's body, as
Cyprian well observes. To come nearer yet, our own parents by their
offences, indiscretion and intemperance, are our mortal enemies. <a href="#note868">[868]</a><q>The
fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.</q>
They cause our grief many times, and put upon us hereditary diseases,
inevitable infirmities: they torment us, and we are ready to injure our
posterity;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note869">[869]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;mox daturi progeniem vitiosiorem.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">And yet with crimes to us unknown,</div>
<div class="line">Our sons shall mark the coming age their own;</div>
</div>
and the latter end of the world, as <a href="#note870">[870]</a>Paul foretold, is still like to
be the worst. We are thus bad by nature, bad by kind, but far worse by art,
every man the greatest enemy unto himself. We study many times to undo
ourselves, abusing those good gifts which God hath bestowed upon us,
health, wealth, strength, wit, learning, art, memory to our own
destruction, <a href="#note871">[871]</a><span lang="la">Perditio tua ex te</span>. As <a href="#note872">[872]</a>Judas Maccabeus killed
Apollonius with his own weapons, we arm ourselves to our own overthrows;
and use reason, art, judgment, all that should help us, as so many
instruments to undo us. Hector gave Ajax a sword, which so long as he
fought against enemies, served for his help and defence; but after he began
to hurt harmless creatures with it, turned to his own hurtless bowels.
Those excellent means God hath bestowed on us, well employed, cannot but
much avail us; but if otherwise perverted, they ruin and confound us: and
so by reason of our indiscretion and weakness they commonly do, we have too
many instances. This St. Austin acknowledgeth of himself in his humble
confessions, <q>promptness of wit, memory, eloquence, they were God's good
gifts, but he did not use them to his glory.</q> If you will particularly know
how, and by what means, consult physicians, and they will tell you, that it
is in offending in some of those six non-natural things, of which I shall
<a href="#note873">[873]</a>dilate more at large; they are the causes of our infirmities, our
surfeiting, and drunkenness, our immoderate insatiable lust, and prodigious
riot. <span lang="la">Plures crapula, quam gladius</span>, is a true saying, the board consumes
more than the sword. Our intemperance it is, that pulls so many several
incurable diseases upon our heads, that hastens <a href="#note874">[874]</a>old age, perverts our
temperature, and brings upon us sudden death. <a href="#index7"></a>And last of all, that which
crucifies us most, is our own folly, madness (<span lang="la">quos Jupiter perdit,
dementat</span>; by subtraction of his assisting grace God permits it) weakness,
want of government, our facility and proneness in yielding to several
lusts, in giving way to every passion and perturbation of the mind: by
which means we metamorphose ourselves and degenerate into beasts. All which
that prince of <a href="#note875">[875]</a>poets observed of Agamemnon, that when he was well
pleased, and could moderate his passion, he was&mdash;<span lang="la">os oculosque Jovi par</span>:
like Jupiter in feature, Mars in valour, Pallas in wisdom, another god; but
when he became angry, he was a lion, a tiger, a dog, &amp;c., there appeared no
sign or likeness of Jupiter in him; so we, as long as we are ruled by
reason, correct our inordinate appetite, and conform ourselves to God's
word, are as so many saints: but if we give reins to lust, anger, ambition,
pride, and follow our own ways, we degenerate into beasts, transform
ourselves, overthrow our constitutions, <a href="#note876">[876]</a>provoke God to anger, and
heap upon us this of melancholy, and all kinds of incurable diseases, as a
just and deserved punishment of our sins.

<h4><a name="1.1.1.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>The Definition, Number, Division of Diseases</i>.</h4>

<p>What a disease is, almost every physician defines. <a href="#note877">[877]</a>Fernelius calleth
it an <q>affection of the body contrary to nature.</q> <a href="#note878">[878]</a>Fuschius and Crato,
<q>an hindrance, hurt, or alteration of any action of the body, or part of
it.</q> <a href="#note879">[879]</a>Tholosanus, <q>a dissolution of that league which is between body
and soul, and a perturbation of it; as health the perfection, and makes to
the preservation of it.</q> <a href="#note880">[880]</a>Labeo in Agellius, <q>an ill habit of the
body, opposite to nature, hindering the use of it.</q> Others otherwise, all
to this effect.

<p><i>Number of Diseases</i>.] How many diseases there are, is a question not yet
determined; <a href="#note881">[881]</a>Pliny reckons up 300 from the crown of the head to the
sole of the foot: elsewhere he saith, <span lang="la">morborum infinita multitudo</span>, their
number is infinite. Howsoever it was in those times, it boots not; in our
days I am sure the number is much augmented:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note882">[882]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;macies, et nova febrium</div>
<div class="line">Terris incubit cohors.</div>
</div>
For besides many epidemical diseases unheard of, and altogether unknown to
Galen and Hippocrates, as scorbutum, small-pox, plica, sweating sickness,
morbus Gallicus, &amp;c., we have many proper and peculiar almost to every
part.

<p><i>No man free from some Disease or other</i>.] No man amongst us so sound, of
so good a constitution, that hath not some impediment of body or mind.
<span lang="la">Quisque suos patimur manes</span>, we have all our infirmities, first or last,
more or less. There will be peradventure in an age, or one of a thousand,
like Zenophilus the musician in <a href="#note883">[883]</a>Pliny, that may happily live 105
years without any manner of impediment; a Pollio Romulus, that can preserve
himself <a href="#note884">[884]</a><q>with wine and oil;</q> a man as fortunate as Q. Metellus, of
whom Valerius so much brags; a man as healthy as Otto Herwardus, a senator
of Augsburg in Germany, whom <a href="#note885">[885]</a>Leovitius the astrologer brings in for
an example and instance of certainty in his art; who because he had the
significators in his geniture fortunate, and free from the hostile aspects
of Saturn and Mars, being a very cold man, <a href="#note886">[886]</a><q>could not remember that
ever he was sick.</q> <a href="#note887">[887]</a>Paracelsus may brag that he could make a man live
400 years or more, if he might bring him up from his infancy, and diet him
as he list; and some physicians hold, that there is no certain period of
man's life; but it may still by temperance and physic be prolonged. We find
in the meantime, by common experience, that no man can escape, but that of
<a href="#note888">[888]</a>Hesiod is true:

<p><i>Division of Diseases</i>.] If you require a more exact division of these
ordinary diseases which are incident to men, I refer you to physicians;
<a href="#note889">[889]</a>they will tell you of acute and chronic, first and secondary,
lethals, salutares, errant, fixed, simple, compound, connexed, or
consequent, belonging to parts or the whole, in habit, or in disposition,
&amp;c. My division at this time (as most befitting my purpose) shall be into
those of the body and mind. For them of the body, a brief catalogue of
which Fuschius hath made, <span class="cite">Institut. lib. 3, sect. 1, cap. 11.</span> I refer you
to the voluminous tomes of Galen, Areteus, Rhasis, Avicenna, Alexander,
Paulus Aetius, Gordonerius: and those exact Neoterics, Savanarola,
Capivaccius, Donatus Altomarus, Hercules de Saxonia, Mercurialis, Victorius
Faventinus, Wecker, Piso, &amp;c., that have methodically and elaborately
written of them all. Those of the mind and head I will briefly handle, and
apart.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.1.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Division of the Diseases of the Head</i>.</h4>

<p>These diseases of the mind, forasmuch as they have their chief seat and
organs in the head, which are commonly repeated amongst the diseases of the
head which are divers, and vary much according to their site. For in the
head, as there be several parts, so there be divers grievances, which
according to that division of <a href="#note890">[890]</a>Heurnius, (which he takes out of
Arculanus,) are inward or outward (to omit all others which pertain to eyes
and ears, nostrils, gums, teeth, mouth, palate, tongue, weezle, chops, face,
&amp;c.) belonging properly to the brain, as baldness, falling of hair,
furfur, lice, &amp;c. <a href="#note891">[891]</a>Inward belonging to the skins next to the brain,
called <i>dura</i> and <i>pia mater</i>, as all headaches, &amp;c., or to the
ventricles, caules, kells, tunicles, creeks, and parts of it, and their
passions, as caro, vertigo, incubus, apoplexy, falling sickness. The
diseases of the nerves, cramps, stupor, convulsion, tremor, palsy: or
belonging to the excrements of the brain, catarrhs, sneezing, rheums,
distillations: or else those that pertain to the substance of the brain
itself, in which are conceived frenzy, lethargy, melancholy, madness, weak
memory, sopor, or <span lang="la">Coma Vigilia et vigil Coma</span>. Out of these again I will
single such as properly belong to the phantasy, or imagination, or reason
itself, which <a href="#note892">[892]</a>Laurentius calls the disease of the mind; and
Hildesheim, <span lang="la">morbos imaginationis, aut rationis laesae</span>, (diseases of the
imagination, or of injured reason,) which are three or four in number,
frenzy, madness, melancholy, dotage, and their kinds: as hydrophobia,
lycanthropia, <span lang="la">Chorus sancti viti, morbi daemoniaci</span>, (St. Vitus's dance,
possession of devils,) which I will briefly touch and point at, insisting
especially in this of melancholy, as more eminent than the rest, and that
through all his kinds, causes, symptoms, prognostics, cures: as Lonicerus
hath done <span class="cite">de apoplexia</span>, and many other of such particular diseases. Not
that I find fault with those which have written of this subject before, as
Jason Pratensis, Laurentius, Montaltus, T. Bright, &amp;c., they have done very
well in their several kinds and methods; yet that which one omits, another
may haply see; that which one contracts, another may enlarge. To conclude
with <a href="#note893">[893]</a>Scribanius, <q>that which they had neglected, or perfunctorily
handled, we may more thoroughly examine; that which is obscurely delivered
in them, may be perspicuously dilated and amplified by us:</q> and so made
more familiar and easy for every man's capacity, and the common good, which
is the chief end of my discourse.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.1.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Dotage, Frenzy, Madness, Hydrophobia, Lycanthropia, Chorus
sancti Viti, Extasis</i>.</h4>

<p><em>Delirium, Dotage</em>.] Dotage, fatuity, or folly, is a common name to all the
following species, as some will have it. <a href="#note894">[894]</a>Laurentius and <a href="#note895">[895]</a>
Altomarus comprehended madness, melancholy, and the rest under this name,
and call it the <span lang="la">summum genus</span> of them all. If it be distinguished from
them, it is natural or ingenite, which comes by some defect of the organs,
and overmuch brain, as we see in our common fools; and is for the most
part intended or remitted in particular men, and thereupon some are wiser
than others: or else it is acquisite, an appendix or symptom of some other
disease, which comes or goes; or if it continue, a sign of melancholy
itself.

<p><i>Frenzy</i>.] <i>Phrenitis</i>, which the Greeks derive from the word <span lang="gr">&phi;&rho;&eta;&nu;</span>, is a disease of the mind, with a continual madness or dotage,
which hath an acute fever annexed, or else an inflammation of the brain, or
the membranes or kells of it, with an acute fever, which causeth madness and
dotage. It differs from melancholy and madness, because their dotage is
without an ague: this continual, with waking, or memory decayed, &amp;c.
Melancholy is most part silent, this clamorous; and many such like
differences are assigned by physicians.

<p><i>Madness</i>.] Madness, frenzy, and melancholy are confounded by Celsus, and
many writers; others leave out frenzy, and make madness and melancholy but
one disease, which <a href="#note896">[896]</a>Jason Pratensis especially labours, and that they
differ only <span lang="la">secundam majus</span> or <span lang="la">minus</span>, in quantity alone, the one being a
degree to the other, and both proceeding from one cause. They differ
<span lang="la">intenso et remisso gradu</span>, saith <a href="#note897">[897]</a>Gordonius, as the humour is
intended or remitted. Of the same mind is <a href="#note898">[898]</a>Areteus, Alexander
Tertullianus, Guianerius, Savanarola, Heurnius; and Galen himself writes
promiscuously of them both by reason of their affinity: but most of our
neoterics do handle them apart, whom I will follow in this treatise.
Madness is therefore defined to be a vehement dotage; or raving without a
fever, far more violent than melancholy, full of anger and clamour,
horrible looks, actions, gestures, troubling the patients with far greater
vehemency both of body and mind, without all fear and sorrow, with such
impetuous force and boldness, that sometimes three or four men cannot hold
them. Differing only in this from frenzy, that it is without a fever, and
their memory is most part better. It hath the same causes as the other, as
choler adust, and blood incensed, brains inflamed, &amp;c. <a href="#note899">[899]</a>Fracastorius
adds, <q>a due time, and full age</q> to this definition, to distinguish it from
children, and will have it confirmed impotency, to separate it from such as
accidentally come and go again, as by taking henbane, nightshade, wine, &amp;c.
Of this fury there be divers kinds; <a href="#note900">[900]</a>ecstasy, which is familiar with
some persons, as Cardan saith of himself, he could be in one when he list;
in which the Indian priests deliver their oracles, and the witches in
Lapland, as Olaus Magnus writeth, <span class="cite">l. 3, cap. 18.</span> <span lang="la">Extasi omnia praedicere</span>,
answer all questions in an ecstasis you will ask; what your friends do,
where they are, how they fare, &amp;c. The other species of this fury are
enthusiasms, revelations, and visions, so often mentioned by Gregory and
Bede in their works; obsession or possession of devils, sibylline prophets,
and poetical furies; such as come by eating noxious herbs, tarantulas
stinging, &amp;c., which some reduce to this. The most known are these,
lycanthropia, hydrophobia, chorus sancti Viti.

<p><i>Lycanthropia</i>.] Lycanthropia, which Avicenna calls <span lang="la">cucubuth</span>, others
<span lang="la">lupinam insaniam</span>, or wolf-madness, when men run howling about graves and
fields in the night, and will not be persuaded but that they are wolves, or
some such beasts. <a href="#note901">[901]</a>Aetius and <a href="#note902">[902]</a>Paulus call it a kind of
melancholy; but I should rather refer it to madness, as most do. Some make
a doubt of it whether there be any such disease. <a href="#note903">[903]</a>Donat ab Altomari
saith, that he saw two of them in his time: <a href="#note904">[904]</a>Wierus tells a story of
such a one at Padua 1541, that would not believe to the contrary, but that
he was a wolf. He hath another instance of a Spaniard, who thought himself
a bear; <a href="#note905">[905]</a>Forrestus confirms as much by many examples; one amongst the
rest of which he was an eyewitness, at Alcmaer in Holland, a poor
husbandman that still hunted about graves, and kept in churchyards, of a
pale, black, ugly, and fearful look. Such belike, or little better, were
king Praetus' <a href="#note906">[906]</a>daughters, that thought themselves kine. And
Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel, as some interpreters hold, was only troubled with
this kind of madness. This disease perhaps gave occasion to that bold
assertion of <a href="#note907">[907]</a>Pliny, <q>some men were turned into wolves in his time,
and from wolves to men again:</q> and to that fable of Pausanias, of a man
that was ten years a wolf, and afterwards turned to his former shape: to
<a href="#note908">[908]</a>Ovid's tale of Lycaon, &amp;c. He that is desirous to hear of this
disease, or more examples, let him read Austin in his 18th book <span class="cite">de
Civitate Dei, cap. 5.</span> Mizaldus, <span class="cite">cent. 5. 77.</span> Sckenkius, <span class="cite">lib. 1.</span>
Hildesheim, <span class="cite">spicel. 2. de Mania</span>. Forrestus <span class="cite">lib. 10. de morbis cerebri.</span>
Olaus Magnus, Vincentius Bellavicensis, <span class="cite">spec. met. lib. 31. c. 122.</span>
Pierius, Bodine, Zuinger, Zeilger, Peucer, Wierus, Spranger, &amp;c. This
malady, saith Avicenna, troubleth men most in February, and is nowadays
frequent in Bohemia and Hungary, according to <a href="#note909">[909]</a>Heurnius. Scheretzius
will have it common in Livonia. They lie hid most part all day, and go
abroad in the night, barking, howling, at graves and deserts; <a href="#note910">[910]</a><q>they
have usually hollow eyes, scabbed legs and thighs, very dry and pale,</q>
<a href="#note911">[911]</a>saith Altomarus; he gives a reason there of all the symptoms, and
sets down a brief cure of them.

<p><i>Hydrophobia</i> is a kind of madness, well known in every village, which
comes by the biting of a mad dog, or scratching, saith <a href="#note912">[912]</a>Aurelianus;
touching, or smelling alone sometimes as <a href="#note913">[913]</a>Sckenkius proves, and is
incident to many other creatures as well as men: so called because the
parties affected cannot endure the sight of water, or any liquor, supposing
still they see a mad dog in it. And which is more wonderful; though they be
very dry, (as in this malady they are) they will rather die than drink:
<a href="#note914">[914]</a>de Venenis Caelius Aurelianus, an ancient writer, makes a doubt
whether this Hydrophobia be a passion of the body or the mind. The part
affected is the brain: the cause, poison that comes from the mad dog, which
is so hot and dry, that it consumes all the moisture in the body. <a href="#note915">[915]</a>
Hildesheim relates of some that died so mad; and being cut up, had no
water, scarce blood, or any moisture left in them. To such as are so
affected, the fear of water begins at fourteen days after they are bitten,
to some again not till forty or sixty days after: commonly saith Heurnius,
they begin to rave, fly water and glasses, to look red, and swell in the
face, about twenty days after (if some remedy be not taken in the meantime)
to lie awake, to be pensive, sad, to see strange visions, to bark and howl,
to fall into a swoon, and oftentimes fits of the falling sickness. <a href="#note916">[916]</a>
Some say, little things like whelps will be seen in their urine. If any of
these signs appear, they are past recovery. Many times these symptoms will
not appear till six or seven months after, saith <a href="#note917">[917]</a>Codronchus; and
sometimes not till seven or eight years, as Guianerius; twelve as Albertus;
six or eight months after, as Galen holds. Baldus the great lawyer died of
it: an Augustine friar, and a woman in Delft, that were <a href="#note918">[918]</a>Forrestus'
patients, were miserably consumed with it. The common cure in the country
(for such at least as dwell near the seaside) is to duck them over head
and ears in sea water; some use charms: every good wife can prescribe
medicines. But the best cure to be had in such cases, is from the most
approved physicians; they that will read of them, may consult with
Dioscorides, <span class="cite">lib. 6. c. 37</span>, Heurnius, Hildesheim, Capivaccius, Forrestus,
Sckenkius and before all others Codronchus an Italian, who hath lately
written two exquisite books on the subject.

<p><span lang="la">Chorus sancti Viti</span>, or St. Vitus's dance; the lascivious dance, <a href="#note919">[919]</a>
Paracelsus calls it, because they that are taken from it, can do nothing
but dance till they be dead, or cured. It is so called, for that the
parties so troubled were wont to go to St. Vitus for help, and after they
had danced there awhile, they were <a href="#note920">[920]</a>certainly freed. 'Tis strange to
hear how long they will dance, and in what manner, over stools, forms,
tables; even great bellied women sometimes (and yet never hurt their
children) will dance so long that they can stir neither hand nor foot, but
seem to be quite dead. One in red clothes they cannot abide. Music above
all things they love, and therefore magistrates in Germany will hire
musicians to play to them, and some lusty sturdy companions to dance with
them. This disease hath been very common in Germany, as appears by those
relations of <a href="#note921">[921]</a>Sckenkius, and Paracelsus in his book of Madness, who
brags how many several persons he hath cured of it. Felix Plateras <span class="cite">de
mentis alienat. cap. 3</span>, reports of a woman in Basil whom he saw, that
danced a whole month together. The Arabians call it a kind of palsy. Bodine
in his 5th book <span class="cite">de Repub. cap. 1</span>, speaks of this infirmity; Monavius in
his last epistle to Scoltizius, and in another to Dudithus, where you may
read more of it.

<p>The last kind of madness or melancholy, is that demoniacal (if I may so
call it) obsession or possession of devils, which Platerus and others would
have to be preternatural: stupend things are said of them, their actions,
gestures, contortions, fasting, prophesying, speaking languages they were
never taught, &amp;c. Many strange stories are related of them, which because
some will not allow, (for Deacon and Darrel have written large volumes on
this subject pro and con.) I voluntarily omit.

<p><a href="#note922">[922]</a>Fuschius, <span class="cite">Institut. lib. 3. sec. 1. cap. 11</span>, Felix Plater,
<a href="#note923">[923]</a>Laurentius, add to these another fury that proceeds from love, and
another from study, another divine or religious fury; but these more
properly belong to melancholy; of all which I will speak <a href="#note924">[924]</a>apart,
intending to write a whole book of them.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.1.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Melancholy in Disposition, improperly so called, Equivocations</i>.</h4>

<p>Melancholy, the subject of our present discourse, is either in disposition
or habit. In disposition, is that transitory melancholy which goes and
comes upon every small occasion of sorrow, need, sickness, trouble, fear,
grief, passion, or perturbation of the mind, any manner of care,
discontent, or thought, which causeth anguish, dullness, heaviness and
vexation of spirit, any ways opposite to pleasure, mirth, joy, delight,
causing frowardness in us, or a dislike. In which equivocal and improper
sense, we call him melancholy that is dull, sad, sour, lumpish, ill
disposed, solitary, any way moved, or displeased. And from these melancholy
dispositions, <a href="#note925">[925]</a>no man living is free, no stoic, none so wise, none so
happy, none so patient, so generous, so godly, so divine, that can
vindicate himself; so well composed, but more or less, some time or other
he feels the smart of it. Melancholy in this sense is the character of
mortality. <a href="#note926">[926]</a><q>Man that is born of a woman, is of short continuance, and
full of trouble.</q> Zeno, Cato, Socrates himself, whom <a href="#note927">[927]</a>Aelian so highly
commends for a moderate temper, that <q>nothing could disturb him, but going
out, and coming in, still Socrates kept the same serenity of countenance,
what misery soever befell him,</q> (if we may believe Plato his disciple) was
much tormented with it. Q. Metellus, in whom <a href="#note928">[928]</a>Valerius gives instance
of all happiness, <q>the most fortunate man then living, born in that most
flourishing city of Rome, of noble parentage, a proper man of person, well
qualified, healthful, rich, honourable, a senator, a consul, happy in his
wife, happy in his children,</q> &amp;c. yet this man was not void of melancholy,
he had his share of sorrow. <a href="#note929">[929]</a>Polycrates Samius, that flung his ring
into the sea, because he would participate of discontent with others, and
had it miraculously restored to him again shortly after, by a fish taken as
he angled, was not free from melancholy dispositions. No man can cure
himself; the very gods had bitter pangs, and frequent passions, as their
own <a href="#note930">[930]</a>poets put upon them. In general, <a href="#note931">[931]</a><q>as the heaven, so is our
life, sometimes fair, sometimes overcast, tempestuous, and serene; as in a
rose, flowers and prickles; in the year itself, a temperate summer
sometimes, a hard winter, a drought, and then again pleasant showers: so is
our life intermixed with joys, hopes, fears, sorrows, calumnies: <span lang="la">Invicem
cedunt dolor et voluptas</span>,</q> there is a succession of pleasure and pain.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note932">[932]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;medio de fonte leporum</div>
<div class="line">Surgit amari aliquid, in ipsis floribus angat.</div>
</div>
<q>Even in the midst of laughing there is sorrow,</q> (as <a href="#note933">[933]</a>Solomon holds):
even in the midst of all our feasting and jollity, as <a href="#note934">[934]</a>Austin infers
in his <span class="cite">Com. on the 41st Psalm</span>, there is grief and discontent. <span lang="la">Inter
delicias semper aliquid saevi nos strangulat</span>, for a pint of honey thou
shalt here likely find a gallon of gall, for a dram of pleasure a pound of
pain, for an inch of mirth an ell of moan; as ivy doth an oak, these
miseries encompass our life. And it is most absurd and ridiculous for any
mortal man to look for a perpetual tenure of happiness in his life. Nothing
so prosperous and pleasant, but it hath <a href="#note935">[935]</a>some bitterness in it, some
complaining, some grudging; it is all <span lang="gr">&gamma;&lambda;&upsilon;&kappa;&#x1F7B;&pi;&iota;&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span>, a mixed
passion, and like a chequer table black and white: men, families, cities,
have their falls and wanes; now trines, sextiles, then quartiles and
oppositions. We are not here as those angels, celestial powers and bodies,
sun and moon, to finish our course without all offence, with such
constancy, to continue for so many ages: but subject to infirmities,
miseries, interrupted, tossed and tumbled up and down, carried about with
every small blast, often molested and disquieted upon each slender
occasion, <a href="#note936">[936]</a>uncertain, brittle, and so is all that we trust unto. <a href="#note937">[937]</a>
<q>And he that knows not this is not armed to endure it, is not fit to live
in this world (as one condoles our time), he knows not the condition of it,
where with a reciprocalty, pleasure and pain are still united, and succeed
one another in a ring.</q> <span lang="la">Exi e mundo</span>, get thee gone hence if thou canst
not brook it; there is no way to avoid it, but to arm thyself with
patience, with magnanimity, to <a href="#note938">[938]</a>oppose thyself unto it, to suffer
affliction as a good soldier of Christ; as <a href="#note939">[939]</a>Paul adviseth constantly
to bear it. But forasmuch as so few can embrace this good council of his,
or use it aright, but rather as so many brute beasts give away to their
passion, voluntary subject and precipitate themselves into a labyrinth of
cares, woes, miseries, and suffer their souls to be overcome by them,
cannot arm themselves with that patience as they ought to do, it falleth
out oftentimes that these dispositions become habits, and <q>many affects
contemned</q> (as <a href="#note940">[940]</a>Seneca notes) <q>make a disease. Even as one distillation,
not yet grown to custom, makes a cough; but continual and inveterate
causeth a consumption of the lungs;</q> so do these our melancholy
provocations: and according as the humour itself is intended, or remitted
in men, as their temperature of body, or rational soul is better able to
make resistance; so are they more or less affected. For that which is but a
flea-biting to one, causeth insufferable torment to another; and which one
by his singular moderation, and well-composed carriage can happily
overcome, a second is no whit able to sustain, but upon every small
occasion of misconceived abuse, injury, grief, disgrace, loss, cross,
humour, &amp;c. (if solitary, or idle) yields so far to passion, that his
complexion is altered, his digestion hindered, his sleep gone, his spirits
obscured, and his heart heavy, his hypochondries misaffected; wind,
crudity, on a sudden overtake him, and he himself overcome with melancholy.
As it is with a man imprisoned for debt, if once in the gaol, every
creditor will bring his action against him, and there likely hold him. If
any discontent seize upon a patient, in an instant all other perturbations
(for&mdash;<span lang="la">qua data porta ruunt</span>) will set upon him, and then like a lame dog
or broken-winged goose he droops and pines away, and is brought at last to
that ill habit or malady of melancholy itself. So that as the philosophers
make <a href="#note941">[941]</a>eight degrees of heat and cold, we may make eighty-eight of
melancholy, as the parts affected are diversely seized with it, or have
been plunged more or less into this infernal gulf, or waded deeper into it.
But all these melancholy fits, howsoever pleasing at first, or displeasing,
violent and tyrannizing over those whom they seize on for the time; yet
these fits I say, or men affected, are but improperly so called, because
they continue not, but come and go, as by some objects they aye moved. This
melancholy of which we are to treat, is a habit, <span lang="la">mosbus sonticus</span>, or
<span lang="la">chronicus</span>, a chronic or continuate disease, a settled humour, as <a href="#note942">[942]</a>
Aurelianus and <a href="#note943">[943]</a>others call it, not errant, but fixed; and as it was
long increasing, so now being (pleasant, or painful) grown to an habit, it
will hardly be removed.

<h4><a name="1.1.2.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Digression of Anatomy</i>.</h4>

<p>Before I proceed to define the disease of melancholy, what it is, or to
discourse farther of it, I hold it not impertinent to make a brief
digression of the anatomy of the body and faculties of the soul, for the
better understanding of that which is to follow; because many hard words
will often occur, as mirach, hypocondries, emerods, &amp;c., imagination,
reason, humours, spirits, vital, natural, animal, nerves, veins, arteries,
chylus, pituita; which by the vulgar will not so easily be perceived, what
they are, how cited, and to what end they serve. And besides, it may
peradventure give occasion to some men to examine more accurately, search
further into this most excellent subject, and thereupon with that royal
<a href="#note944">[944]</a>prophet to praise God, (<q>for a man is fearfully and wonderfully made,
and curiously wrought</q>) that have time and leisure enough, and are
sufficiently informed in all other worldly businesses, as to make a good
bargain, buy and sell, to keep and make choice of a fair hawk, hound,
horse, &amp;c. But for such matters as concern the knowledge of themselves,
they are wholly ignorant and careless; they know not what this body and
soul are, how combined, of what parts and faculties they consist, or how a
man differs from a dog. And what can be more ignominious and filthy (as
<a href="#note945">[945]</a>Melancthon well inveighs) <q>than for a man not to know the structure
and composition of his own body, especially since the knowledge of it tends
so much to the preservation, of his health, and information of his
manners?</q> To stir them up therefore to this study, to peruse those
elaborate works of <a href="#note946">[946]</a>Galen, Bauhines, Plater, Vesalius, Falopius,
Laurentius, Remelinus, &amp;c., which have written copiously in Latin; or that
which some of our industrious countrymen have done in our mother tongue,
not long since, as that translation of <a href="#note947">[947]</a>Columbus and <a href="#note948">[948]</a>
Microcosmographia, in thirteen books, I have made this brief digression.
Also because <a href="#note949">[949]</a>Wecker, <a href="#note950">[950]</a>Melancthon, <a href="#note951">[951]</a>Fernelius, <a href="#note952">[952]</a>
Fuschius, and those tedious Tracts <span class="cite">de Anima</span> (which have more
compendiously handled and written of this matter,) are not at all times
ready to be had, to give them some small taste, or notice of the rest, let
this epitome suffice.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.2.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Division of the Body, Humours, Spirits</i>.</h4>

<p>Of the parts of the body there may be many divisions: the most approved is
that of <a href="#note953">[953]</a>Laurentius, out of Hippocrates: which is, into parts
contained, or containing. Contained, are either humours or spirits.

<p><i>Humours</i>.] A humour is a liquid or fluent part of the body, comprehended
in it, for the preservation of it; and is either innate or born with us, or
adventitious and acquisite. The radical or innate, is daily supplied by
nourishment, which some call cambium, and make those secondary humours of
ros and gluten to maintain it: or acquisite, to maintain these four first
primary humours, coming and proceeding from the first concoction in the
liver, by which means chylus is excluded. Some divide them into profitable
and excrementitious. But <a href="#note954">[954]</a>Crato out of Hippocrates will have all four
to be juice, and not excrements, without which no living creature can be
sustained: which four, though they be comprehended in the mass of blood,
yet they have their several affections, by which they are distinguished
from one another, and from those adventitious, peccant, or <a href="#note955">[955]</a>diseased
humours, as Melancthon calls them.

<p><i>Blood</i>.] Blood is a hot, sweet, temperate, red humour, prepared in the
mesaraic veins, and made of the most temperate parts of the chylus in the
liver, whose office is to nourish the whole body, to give it strength and
colour, being dispersed by the veins through every part of it. And from it
spirits are first begotten in the heart, which afterwards by the arteries
are communicated to the other parts.

<p>Pituita, or phlegm, is a cold and moist humour, begotten of the colder part
of the chylus (or white juice coming out of the meat digested in the
stomach,) in the liver; his office is to nourish and moisten the members of
the body, which as the tongue are moved, that they be not over dry.

<p>Choler, is hot and dry, bitter, begotten of the hotter parts of the chylus,
and gathered to the gall: it helps the natural heat and senses, and serves
to the expelling of excrements.

<p><i>Melancholy</i>.] Melancholy, cold and dry, thick, black, and sour, begotten
of the more feculent part of nourishment, and purged from the spleen, is a
bridle to the other two hot humours, blood and choler, preserving them in
the blood, and nourishing the bones. These four humours have some analogy
with the four elements, and to the four ages in man.

<p><i>Serum, Sweat, Tears</i>.] To these humours you may add serum, which is the
matter of urine, and those excrementitious humours of the third concoction,
sweat and tears.

<p><i>Spirits</i>.] Spirit is a most subtle vapour, which is expressed from the
blood, and the instrument of the soul, to perform all his actions; a common
tie or medium between the body and the soul, as some will have it; or as
<a href="#note956">[956]</a>Paracelsus, a fourth soul of itself. Melancthon holds the fountain of
those spirits to be the heart, begotten there; and afterward conveyed to
the brain, they take another nature to them. Of these spirits there be
three kinds, according to the three principal parts, brain, heart, liver;
natural, vital, animal. The natural are begotten in the liver, and thence
dispersed through the veins, to perform those natural actions. The vital
spirits are made in the heart of the natural, which by the arteries are
transported to all the other parts: if the spirits cease, then life
ceaseth, as in a syncope or swooning. The animal spirits formed of the
vital, brought up to the brain, and diffused by the nerves, to the
subordinate members, give sense and motion to them all.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.2.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Similar Parts</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Similar Parts</i>] Containing parts, by reason of their more solid substance,
are either homogeneal or heterogeneal, similar or dissimilar; so Aristotle
divides them, <span class="cite">lib. 1, cap. 1, de Hist. Animal.</span>; Laurentius, <span class="cite">cap. 20, lib.
1.</span> Similar, or homogeneal, are such as, if they be divided, are still
severed into parts of the same nature, as water into water. Of these some
be spermatical, some fleshy or carnal. <a href="#note957">[957]</a>Spermatical are such as are
immediately begotten of the seed, which are bones, gristles, ligaments,
membranes, nerves, arteries, veins, skins, fibres or strings, fat.

<p><i>Bones</i>.] The bones are dry and hard, begotten of the thickest of the seed,
to strengthen and sustain other parts: some say there be 304, some 307, or
313 in man's body. They have no nerves in them, and are therefore without
sense.

<p>A gristle is a substance softer than bone, and harder than the rest,
flexible, and serves to maintain the parts of motion.

<p>Ligaments are they that tie the bones together, and other parts to the
bones, with their subserving tendons: membranes' office is to cover the
rest.

<p>Nerves, or sinews, are membranes without, and full of marrow within; they
proceed from the brain, and carry the animal spirits for sense and motion.
Of these some be harder, some softer; the softer serve the senses, and
there be seven pair of them. The first be the optic nerves, by which we
see; the second move the eyes; the third pair serve for the tongue to
taste; the fourth pair for the taste in the palate; the fifth belong to the
ears; the sixth pair is most ample, and runs almost over all the bowels;
the seventh pair moves the tongue. The harder sinews serve for the motion
of the inner parts, proceeding from the marrow in the back, of whom there
be thirty combinations, seven of the neck, twelve of the breast, &amp;c.

<p><i>Arteries</i>.] Arteries are long and hollow, with a double skin to convey the
vital spirit; to discern which the better, they say that Vesalius the
anatomist was wont to cut up men alive. <a href="#note958">[958]</a>They arise in the left side
of the heart, and are principally two, from which the rest are derived,
aorta and venosa: aorta is the root of all the other, which serve the whole
body; the other goes to the lungs, to fetch air to refrigerate the heart.

<p><i>Veins</i>.] Veins are hollow and round, like pipes, arising from the liver,
carrying blood and natural spirits; they feed all the parts. Of these there
be two chief, <i>Vena porta</i> and <i>Vena cava</i>, from which the rest are
corrivated. That <i>Vena porta</i> is a vein coming from the concave of the
liver, and receiving those mesaraical veins, by whom he takes the chylus
from the stomach and guts, and conveys it to the liver. The other derives
blood from the liver to nourish all the other dispersed members. The
branches of that <i>Vena porta</i> are the mesaraical and haemorrhoids. The
branches of the <i>cava</i> are inward or outward. Inward, seminal or emulgent.
Outward, in the head, arms, feet, &amp;c., and have several names.

<p><i>Fibrae, Fat, Flesh</i>.] Fibrae are strings, white and solid, dispersed
through the whole member, and right, oblique, transverse, all which have
their several uses. Fat is a similar part, moist, without blood, composed
of the most thick and unctuous matter of the blood. The <a href="#note959">[959]</a>skin covers
the rest, and hath <span lang="la">cuticulum</span>, or a little skin tinder it. Flesh is soft
and ruddy, composed of the congealing of blood, &amp;c.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.2.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Dissimilar Parts</i>.</h4>

<p>Dissimilar parts are those which we call organical, or instrumental, and
they be inward or outward. The chiefest outward parts are situate forward
or backward:&mdash;forward, the crown and foretop of the head, skull, face,
forehead, temples, chin, eyes, ears, nose, &amp;c., neck, breast, chest, upper
and lower part of the belly, hypocondries, navel, groin, flank, &amp;c.;
backward, the hinder part of the head, back, shoulders, sides, loins,
hipbones, <span lang="la">os sacrum</span>, buttocks, &amp;c. Or joints, arms, hands, feet, legs,
thighs, knees, &amp;c. Or common to both, which, because they are obvious and
well known, I have carelessly repeated, <span lang="la">eaque praecipua et grandiora
tantum; quod reliquum ex libris de anima qui volet, accipiat</span>.

<p>Inward organical parts, which cannot be seen, are divers in number, and
have several names, functions, and divisions; but that of <a href="#note960">[960]</a>Laurentius
is most notable, into noble or ignoble parts. Of the noble there be three
principal parts, to which all the rest belong, and whom they serve&mdash;brain,
heart, liver; according to whose site, three regions, or a threefold
division, is made of the whole body. As first of the head, in which the
animal organs are contained, and brain itself, which by his nerves give
sense and motion to the rest, and is, as it were, a privy counsellor and
chancellor to the heart. The second region is the chest, or middle belly,
in which the heart as king keeps his court, and by his arteries
communicates life to the whole body. The third region is the lower belly,
in which the liver resides as a <span lang="la">Legat a latere</span>, with the rest of those
natural organs, serving for concoction, nourishment, expelling of
excrements. This lower region is distinguished from the upper by the
midriff, or diaphragma, and is subdivided again by <a href="#note961">[961]</a>some into three
concavities or regions, upper, middle, and lower. The upper of the
hypocondries, in whose right side is the liver, the left the spleen; from
which is denominated hypochondriacal melancholy. The second of the navel
and flanks, divided from the first by the rim. The last of the water
course, which is again subdivided into three other parts. The Arabians make
two parts of this region, <span lang="la">Epigastrium</span> and <span lang="la">Hypogastrium</span>, upper or lower.
<span lang="la">Epigastrium</span> they call <i>Mirach</i>, from whence comes <span lang="la">Mirachialis
Melancholia</span>, sometimes mentioned of them. Of these several regions I will
treat in brief apart; and first of the third region, in which the natural
organs are contained.

<p><i>De Anima.&mdash;The Lower Region, Natural Organs</i>.] But you that are readers in
the meantime, <q>Suppose you were now brought into some sacred temple, or
majestical palace</q> (as <a href="#note962">[962]</a>Melancthon saith), <q>to behold not the matter
only, but the singular art, workmanship, and counsel of this our great
Creator. And it is a pleasant and profitable speculation, if it be
considered aright.</q> The parts of this region, which present themselves to
your consideration and view, are such as serve to nutrition or generation.
Those of nutrition serve to the first or second concoction; as the
oesophagus or gullet, which brings meat and drink into the stomach. The
ventricle or stomach, which is seated in the midst of that part of the
belly beneath the midriff, the kitchen, as it were, of the first
concoction, and which turns our meat into chylus. It hath two mouths, one
above, another beneath. The upper is sometimes taken for the stomach
itself; the lower and nether door (as Wecker calls it) is named Pylorus.
This stomach is sustained by a large kell or caul, called omentum; which
some will have the same with peritoneum, or rim of the belly. From the
stomach to the very fundament are produced the guts, or intestina, which
serve a little to alter and distribute the chylus, and convey away the
excrements. They are divided into small and great, by reason of their site
and substance, slender or thicker: the slender is duodenum, or whole gut,
which is next to the stomach, some twelve inches long, saith <a href="#note963">[963]</a>
Fuschius. Jejunum, or empty gut, continuate to the other, which hath many
mesaraic veins annexed to it, which take part of the chylus to the liver
from it. Ilion the third, which consists of many crinkles, which serves
with the rest to receive, keep, and distribute the chylus from the stomach.
The thick guts are three, the blind gut, colon, and right gut. The blind is
a thick and short gut, having one mouth, in which the ilium and colon meet:
it receives the excrements, and conveys them to the colon. This colon hath
many windings, that the excrements pass not away too fast: the right gut is
straight, and conveys the excrements to the fundament, whose lower part is
bound up with certain muscles called sphincters, that the excrements may be
the better contained, until such time as a man be willing to go to the
stool. In the midst of these guts is situated the mesenterium or midriff,
composed of many veins, arteries, and much fat, serving chiefly to sustain
the guts. All these parts serve the first concoction. To the second, which
is busied either in refining the good nourishment or expelling the bad, is
chiefly belonging the liver, like in colour to congealed blood, the shop of
blood, situate in the right hypochondry, in figure like to a
half-moon, <span lang="la">generosum membrum</span> Melancthon styles it, a generous part; it
serves to turn the chylus to blood, for the nourishment of the body. The
excrements of it are either choleric or watery, which the other subordinate
parts convey. The gall placed in the concave of the liver, extracts choler
to it: the spleen, melancholy; which is situate on the left side, over
against the liver, a spongy matter, that draws this black choler to it by a
secret virtue, and feeds upon it, conveying the rest to the bottom of the
stomach, to stir up appetite, or else to the guts as an excrement. That
watery matter the two kidneys expurgate by those emulgent veins and
ureters. The emulgent draw this superfluous moisture from the blood; the
two ureters convey it to the bladder, which, by reason of his site in the
lower belly, is apt to receive it, having two parts, neck and bottom: the
bottom holds the water, the neck is constringed with a muscle, which, as a
porter, keeps the water from running out against our will.

<p>Members of generation are common to both sexes, or peculiar to one; which,
because they are impertinent to my purpose, I do voluntarily omit.

<p><i>Middle Region</i>.] Next in order is the middle region, or chest, which
comprehends the vital faculties and parts; which (as I have said) is
separated from the lower belly by the diaphragma or midriff, which is a
skin consisting of many nerves, membranes; and amongst other uses it hath,
is the instrument of laughing. There is also a certain thin membrane, full
of sinews, which covereth the whole chest within, and is called pleura, the
seat of the disease called pleurisy, when it is inflamed; some add a third
skin, which is termed mediastinus, which divides the chest into two parts,
right and left; of this region the principal part is the heart, which is
the seat and fountain of life, of heat, of spirits, of pulse and
respiration&mdash;the sun of our body, the king and sole commander of it&mdash;the
seat and organ of all passions and affections. <span lang="la">Primum vivens, ultimum
moriens</span>, it lives first, dies last in all creatures. Of a pyramidical
form, and not much unlike to a pineapple; a part worthy of <a href="#note964">[964]</a>
admiration, that can yield such variety of affections, by whose motion it
is dilated or contracted, to stir and command the humours in the body. As
in sorrow, melancholy; in anger, choler; in joy, to send the blood
outwardly; in sorrow, to call it in; moving the humours, as horses do a
chariot. This heart, though it be one sole member, yet it may be divided
into two creeks right and left. The right is like the moon increasing,
bigger than the other part, and receives blood from <i>vena cava</i>,
distributing some of it to the lungs to nourish them; the rest to the left
side, to engender spirits. The left creek hath the form of a cone, and is
the seat of life, which, as a torch doth oil, draws blood unto it,
begetting of it spirits and fire; and as fire in a torch, so are spirits in
the blood; and by that great artery called aorta, it sends vital spirits
over the body, and takes air from the lungs by that artery which is called
<i>venosa</i>; so that both creeks have their vessels, the right two veins, the
left two arteries, besides those two common anfractuous ears, which serve
them both; the one to hold blood, the other air, for several uses. The
lungs is a thin spongy part, like an ox hoof, (saith <a href="#note965">[965]</a>Fernelius) the
town-clerk or crier, (<a href="#note966">[966]</a>one terms it) the instrument of voice, as an
orator to a king; annexed to the heart, to express their thoughts by voice.
That it is the instrument of voice, is manifest, in that no creature can
speak, or utter any voice, which wanteth these lights. It is, besides, the
instrument of respiration, or breathing; and its office is to cool the
heart, by sending air unto it, by the venosal artery, which vein comes to
the lungs by that <i>aspera arteria</i> which consists of many gristles,
membranes, nerves, taking in air at the nose and mouth, and by it likewise
exhales the fumes of the heart.

<p>In the upper region serving the animal faculties, the chief organ is the
brain, which is a soft, marrowish, and white substance, engendered of the
purest part of seed and spirits, included by many skins, and seated within
the skull or brain pan; and it is the most noble organ under heaven, the
dwelling-house and seat of the soul, the habitation of wisdom, memory,
judgment, reason, and in which man is most like unto God; and therefore
nature hath covered it with a skull of hard bone, and two skins or
membranes, whereof the one is called <i>dura mater</i>, or meninx, the other
<i>pia mater</i>. The dura mater is next to the skull, above the other, which
includes and protects the brain. When this is taken away, the pia mater is
to be seen, a thin membrane, the next and immediate cover of the brain, and
not covering only, but entering into it. The brain itself is divided into
two parts, the fore and hinder part; the fore part is much bigger than the
other, which is called the little brain in respect of it. This fore part
hath many concavities distinguished by certain ventricles, which are the
receptacles of the spirits, brought hither by the arteries from the heart,
and are there refined to a more heavenly nature, to perform the actions of
the soul. Of these ventricles there are three&mdash;right, left, and middle. The
right and left answer to their site, and beget animal spirits; if they be
any way hurt, sense and motion ceaseth. These ventricles, moreover, are
held to be the seat of the common sense. The middle ventricle is a common
concourse and cavity of them both, and hath two passages&mdash;the one to
receive pituita, and the other extends itself to the fourth creek; in this
they place imagination and cogitation, and so the three ventricles of the
fore part of the brain are used. The fourth creek behind the head is common
to the cerebel or little brain, and marrow of the backbone, the last and
most solid of all the rest, which receives the animal spirits from the
other ventricles, and conveys them to the marrow in the back, and is the
place where they say the memory is seated.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.2.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Of the Soul and her Faculties</i>.</h4>

<p>According to <a href="#note967">[967]</a>Aristotle, the soul is defined to be
<span lang="gr">&#x1F10;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&lambda;&#x1F73;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span>, <span lang="la">perfectio et actus primus corporis organici, vitam habentis
in potentia</span>: the perfection or first act of an organical body, having
power of life, which most <a href="#note968">[968]</a>philosophers approve. But many doubts arise
about the essence, subject, seat, distinction, and subordinate faculties of
it. For the essence and particular knowledge, of all other things it is
most hard (be it of man or beast) to discern, as <a href="#note969">[969]</a>Aristotle himself,
<a href="#note970">[970]</a>Tully, <a href="#note971">[971]</a>Picus Mirandula, <a href="#note972">[972]</a>Tolet, and other neoteric
philosophers confess:&mdash;<a href="#note973">[973]</a><q>We can understand all things by her, but what
she is we cannot apprehend.</q> Some therefore make one soul, divided into
three principal faculties; others, three distinct souls. Which question of
late hath been much controverted by Picolomineus and Zabarel. <a href="#note974">[974]</a>
Paracelsus will have four souls, adding to the three grand faculties a
spiritual soul: which opinion of his, Campanella, in his book <span class="cite">de sensu
rerum</span> <a href="#note975">[975]</a>much labours to demonstrate and prove, because carcasses bleed
at the sight of the murderer; with many such arguments And <a href="#note976">[976]</a>some
again, one soul of all creatures whatsoever, differing only in organs; and
that beasts have reason as well as men, though, for some defect of organs,
not in such measure. Others make a doubt whether it be all in all, and all
in every part; which is amply discussed in Zabarel amongst the rest. The
<a href="#note977">[977]</a>common division of the soul is into three principal
faculties&mdash;vegetal, sensitive, and rational, which make three distinct
kinds of living creatures&mdash;vegetal plants, sensible beasts, rational men.
How these three principal faculties are distinguished and connected,
<span lang="la">Humano ingenio inaccessum videtur</span>, is beyond human capacity, as <a href="#note978">[978]</a>
Taurellus, Philip, Flavins, and others suppose. The inferior may be alone,
but the superior cannot subsist without the other; so sensible includes
vegetal, rational both; which are contained in it (saith Aristotle) <span lang="la">ut
trigonus in tetragono</span> as a triangle in a quadrangle.

<p><i>Vegetal Soul</i>.] Vegetal, the first of the three distinct faculties, is
defined to be <q>a substantial act of an organical body, by which it is
nourished, augmented, and begets another like unto itself.</q> In which
definition, three several operations are specified&mdash;altrix, auctrix,
procreatrix; the first is <a href="#note979">[979]</a>nutrition, whose object is nourishment,
meat, drink, and the like; his organ the liver in sensible creatures; in
plants, the root or sap. His office is to turn the nutriment into the
substance of the body nourished, which he performs by natural heat. This
nutritive operation hath four other subordinate functions or powers
belonging to it&mdash;attraction, retention, digestion, expulsion.

<p><i>Attraction</i>.] <a href="#note980">[980]</a>Attraction is a ministering faculty, which, as a
loadstone doth iron, draws meat into the stomach, or as a lamp doth oil;
and this attractive power is very necessary in plants, which suck up
moisture by the root, as, another mouth, into the sap, as a like stomach.

<p><i>Retention</i>.] Retention keeps it, being attracted unto the stomach, until
such time it be concocted; for if it should pass away straight, the body
could not be nourished.

<p><i>Digestion</i>.] Digestion is performed by natural heat; for as the flame of a
torch consumes oil, wax, tallow, so doth it alter and digest the nutritive
matter. Indigestion is opposite unto it, for want of natural heat. Of this
digestion there be three differences&mdash;maturation, elixation, assation.

<p><i>Maturation</i>.] Maturation is especially observed in the fruits of trees;
which are then said to be ripe, when the seeds are fit to be sown again.
Crudity is opposed to it, which gluttons, epicures, and idle persons are
most subject unto, that use no exercise to stir natural heat, or else choke
it, as too much wood puts out a fire.

<p><i>Elixation</i>.] Elixation is the seething of meat in the stomach, by the said
natural heat, as meat is boiled in a pot; to which corruption or
putrefaction is opposite.

<p><i>Assation</i>.] Assation is a concoction of the inward moisture by heat; his
opposite is semiustulation.

<p><i>Order of Concoction fourfold</i>.] Besides these three several operations of
digestion, there is a fourfold order of concoction:&mdash;mastication, or
chewing in the mouth; chilification of this so chewed meat in the stomach;
the third is in the liver, to turn this chylus into blood, called
sanguification; the last is assimilation, which is in every part.

<p><i>Expulsion</i>.] Expulsion is a power of nutrition, by which it expels all
superfluous excrements, and relics of meat and drink, by the guts,
bladder, pores; as by purging, vomiting, spitting, sweating, urine, hairs,
nails, &amp;c.

<p><i>Augmentation</i>.] As this nutritive faculty serves to nourish the body, so
doth the augmenting faculty (the second operation or power of the vegetal
faculty) to the increasing of it in quantity, according to all dimensions,
long, broad, thick, and to make it grow till it come to his due proportion
and perfect shape; which hath his period of augmentation, as of
consumption; and that most certain, as the poet observes:&mdash;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Stat sua cuique dies, breve et irreparabile tempus</div>
<div class="line">Omnibus est vitae.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">A term of life is set to every man,</div>
<div class="line">Which is but short, and pass it no one can.</div>
</div>
<p><i>Generation</i>.] The last of these vegetal faculties is generation, which
begets another by means of seed, like unto itself, to the perpetual
preservation of the species. To this faculty they ascribe three subordinate
operations:&mdash;the first to turn nourishment into seed, &amp;c.

<p><i>Life and Death concomitants of the Vegetal Faculties</i>.] Necessary
concomitants or affections of this vegetal faculty are life and his
privation, death. To the preservation of life the natural heat is most
requisite, though siccity and humidity, and those first qualities, be not
excluded. This heat is likewise in plants, as appears by their increasing,
fructifying, &amp;c., though not so easily perceived. In all bodies it must
have radical <a href="#note981">[981]</a>moisture to preserve it, that it be not consumed; to
which preservation our clime, country, temperature, and the good or bad use
of those six non-natural things avail much. For as this natural heat and
moisture decays, so doth our life itself; and if not prevented before by
some violent accident, or interrupted through our own default, is in the
end dried up by old age, and extinguished by death for want of matter, as a
lamp for defect of oil to maintain it.

<h4><a name="1.1.2.6"></a>SUBSECT. VI.&mdash;<i>Of the sensible Soul</i>.</h4>

<p>Next in order is the sensible faculty, which is as far beyond the other in
dignity, as a beast is preferred to a plant, having those vegetal powers
included in it. 'Tis defined an <q>Act of an organical body by which it
lives, hath sense, appetite, judgment, breath, and motion.</q> His object in
general is a sensible or passible quality, because the sense is affected
with it. The general organ is the brain, from which principally the
sensible operations are derived. This sensible soul is divided into two
parts, apprehending or moving. By the apprehensive power we perceive the
species of sensible things present, or absent, and retain them as wax doth
the print of a seal. By the moving, the body is outwardly carried from one
place to another; or inwardly moved by spirits and pulse. The apprehensive
faculty is subdivided into two parts, inward or outward. Outward, as the
five senses, of touching, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, to which you
may add Scaliger's sixth sense of titillation, if you please; or that of
speech, which is the sixth external sense, according to Lullius. Inward are
three&mdash;common sense, phantasy, memory. Those five outward senses have their
object in outward things only, and such as are present, as the eye sees no
colour except it be at hand, the ear sound. Three of these senses are of
commodity, hearing, sight, and smell; two of necessity, touch, and taste,
without which we cannot live. Besides, the sensitive power is active or
passive. Active in sight, the eye sees the colour; passive when it is hurt
by his object, as the eye by the sunbeams. According to that axiom,
<span lang="la">visibile forte destruit sensum</span>. <a href="#note982">[982]</a>Or if the object be not pleasing,
as a bad sound to the ear, a stinking smell to the nose, &amp;c.

<p><i>Sight</i>.] Of these five senses, sight is held to be most precious, and the
best, and that by reason of his object, it sees the whole body at once. By
it we learn, and discern all things, a sense most excellent for use: to the
sight three things are required; the object, the organ, and the medium. The
object in general is visible, or that which is to be seen, as colours, and
all shining bodies. The medium is the illumination of the air, which comes
from <a href="#note983">[983]</a>light, commonly called diaphanum; for in dark we cannot see. The
organ is the eye, and chiefly the apple of it, which by those optic nerves,
concurring both in one, conveys the sight to the common sense. Between the
organ and object a true distance is required, that it be not too near, or
too far off! Many excellent questions appertain to this sense, discussed by
philosophers: as whether this sight be caused <span lang="la">intra mittendo, vel extra
mittendo</span>, &amp;c., by receiving in the visible species, or sending of them
out, which <a href="#note984">[984]</a>Plato, <a href="#note985">[985]</a>Plutarch, <a href="#note986">[986]</a>Macrobius, <a href="#note987">[987]</a>Lactantius
and others dispute. And, besides, it is the subject of the perspectives, of
which Alhazen the Arabian, Vitellio, Roger Bacon, Baptista Porta, Guidus
Ubaldus, Aquilonius, &amp;c., have written whole volumes.

<p><i>Hearing</i>.] Hearing, a most excellent outward sense, <q>by which we learn and
get knowledge.</q> His object is sound, or that which is heard; the medium,
air; organ, the ear. To the sound, which is a collision of the air, three
things are required; a body to strike, as the hand of a musician; the body
struck, which must be solid and able to resist; as a bell, lute-string, not
wool, or sponge; the medium, the air; which is inward, or outward; the
outward being struck or collided by a solid body, still strikes the next
air, until it come to that inward natural air, which as an exquisite organ
is contained in a little skin formed like a drum-head, and struck upon by
certain small instruments like drum-sticks, conveys the sound by a pair of
nerves, appropriated to that use, to the common sense, as to a judge of
sounds. There is great variety and much delight in them; for the knowledge
of which, consult with Boethius and other musicians.

<p><i>Smelling</i>.] Smelling is an <q>outward sense, which apprehends by the
nostrils drawing in air;</q> and of all the rest it is the weakest sense in
men. The organ in the nose, or two small hollow pieces of flesh a little
above it: the medium the air to men, as water to fish: the object, smell,
arising from a mixed body resolved, which, whether it be a quality, fume,
vapour, or exhalation, I will not now dispute, or of their differences, and
how they are caused. This sense is an organ of health, as sight and
hearing, saith <a href="#note988">[988]</a>Agellius, are of discipline; and that by avoiding bad
smells, as by choosing good, which do as much alter and affect the body
many times, as diet itself.

<p><i>Taste</i>.] Taste, a necessary sense, <q>which perceives all savours by the
tongue and palate, and that by means of a thin spittle, or watery juice.</q>
His organ is the tongue with his tasting nerves; the medium, a watery
juice; the object, taste, or savour, which is a quality in the juice,
arising from the mixture of things tasted. Some make eight species or kinds
of savour, bitter, sweet, sharp, salt, &amp;c., all which sick men (as in an
ague) cannot discern, by reason of their organs misaffected.

<p><i>Touching</i>.] Touch, the last of the senses, and most ignoble, yet of as
great necessity as the other, and of as much pleasure. This sense is
exquisite in men, and by his nerves dispersed all over the body, perceives
any tactile quality. His organ the nerves; his object those first
qualities, hot, dry, moist, cold; and those that follow them, hard, soft,
thick, thin, &amp;c. Many delightsome questions are moved by philosophers about
these five senses; their organs, objects, mediums, which for brevity I
omit.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.2.7"></a>SUBSECT. VII.&mdash;<i>Of the Inward Senses.</i></h4>

<p><i>Common Sense</i>.] Inner senses are three in number, so called, because they
be within the brainpan, as common sense, phantasy, memory. Their objects
are not only things present, but they perceive the sensible species of
things to come, past, absent, such as were before in the sense. This common
sense is the judge or moderator of the rest, by whom we discern all
differences of objects; for by mine eye I do not know that I see, or by
mine ear that I hear, but by my common sense, who judgeth of sounds and
colours: they are but the organs to bring the species to be censured; so
that all their objects are his, and all their offices are his. The fore
part of the brain is his organ or seat.

<p><i>Phantasy</i>.] Phantasy, or imagination, which some call estimative, or
cogitative, (confirmed, saith <a href="#note989">[989]</a>Fernelius, by frequent meditation,) is
an inner sense which doth more fully examine the species perceived by
common sense, of things present or absent, and keeps them longer, recalling
them to mind again, or making new of his own. In time of sleep this faculty
is free, and many times conceive strange, stupend, absurd shapes, as in
sick men we commonly observe. His organ is the middle cell of the brain;
his objects all the species communicated to him by the common sense, by
comparison of which he feigns infinite other unto himself. In melancholy
men this faculty is most powerful and strong, and often hurts, producing
many monstrous and prodigious things, especially if it be stirred up by
some terrible object, presented to it from common sense or memory. In poets
and painters imagination forcibly works, as appears by their several
fictions, antics, images: as Ovid's house of sleep, Psyche's palace in
Apuleius, &amp;c. In men it is subject and governed by reason, or at least
should be; but in brutes it hath no superior, and is <span lang="la">ratio brutorum</span>, all
the reason they have.

<p><i>Memory</i>.] Memory lays up all the species which the senses have brought in,
and records them as a good register, that they may be forthcoming when they
are called for by phantasy and reason. His object is the same with
phantasy, his seat and organ the back part of the brain.

<p><a name="index6"></a><i>Affections of the Senses, sleep and waking.</i>] The affections of these
senses are sleep and waking, common to all sensible creatures. <q>Sleep is a
rest or binding of the outward senses, and of the common sense, for the
preservation of body and soul</q> (as Scaliger <a href="#note990">[990]</a>defines it); for when the
common sense resteth, the outward senses rest also. The phantasy alone is
free, and his commander reason: as appears by those imaginary dreams, which
are of divers kinds, natural, divine, demoniacal, &amp;c., which vary according
to humours, diet, actions, objects, &amp;c., of which Artemidorus, Cardanus,
and Sambucus, with their several interpretators, have written great
volumes. This litigation of senses proceeds from an inhibition of spirits,
the way being stopped by which they should come; this stopping is caused of
vapours arising out of the stomach, filling the nerves, by which the
spirits should be conveyed. When these vapours are spent, the passage is
open, and the spirits perform their accustomed duties: so that <q>waking is
the action and motion of the senses, which the spirits dispersed over all
parts cause.</q>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.2.8"></a>SUBSECT. VIII.&mdash;<i>Of the Moving Faculty</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Appetite</i>] This moving faculty is the other power of the sensitive soul,
which causeth all those inward and outward animal motions in the body. It
is divided into two faculties, the power of appetite, and of moving from
place to place. This of appetite is threefold, so some will have it;
natural, as it signifies any such inclination, as of a stone to fall
downward, and such actions as retention, expulsion, which depend not on
sense, but are vegetal, as the appetite of meat and drink; hunger and
thirst. Sensitive is common to men and brutes. Voluntary, the third, or
intellective, which commands the other two in men, and is a curb unto them,
or at least should be, but for the most part is captivated and overruled by
them; and men are led like beasts by sense, giving reins to their
concupiscence and several lusts. For by this appetite the soul is led or
inclined to follow that good which the senses shall approve, or avoid that
which they hold evil: his object being good or evil, the one he embraceth,
the other he rejecteth; according to that aphorism, <span lang="la">Omnia appetunt bonum</span>,
all things seek their own good, or at least seeming good. This power is
inseparable from sense, for where sense is, there are likewise pleasure and
pain. His organ is the same with the common sense, and is divided into two
powers, or inclinations, concupiscible or irascible: or (as one <a href="#note991">[991]</a>
translates it) coveting, anger invading, or impugning. Concupiscible covets
always pleasant and delightsome things, and abhors that which is
distasteful, harsh, and unpleasant. <span lang="la">Irascible, quasi <a href="#note992">[992]</a> aversans per
iram et odium</span>, as avoiding it with anger and indignation. All affections
and perturbations arise out of these two fountains, which, although the
stoics make light of, we hold natural, and not to be resisted. The good
affections are caused by some object of the same nature; and if present,
they procure joy, which dilates the heart, and preserves the body: if
absent, they cause hope, love, desire, and concupiscence. The bad are
simple or mixed: simple for some bad object present, as sorrow, which
contracts the heart, macerates the soul, subverts the good estate of the
body, hindering all the operations of it, causing melancholy, and many
times death itself; or future, as fear. Out of these two arise those mixed
affections and passions of anger, which is a desire of revenge; hatred,
which is inveterate anger; zeal, which is offended with him who hurts that
he loves; and <span lang="gr">&#x1F10;&pi;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&epsilon;&kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span>, a compound affection of joy and hate,
when we rejoice at other men's mischief, and are grieved at their
prosperity; pride, self-love, emulation, envy, shame, &amp;c., of which
elsewhere.

<p><i>Moving from place to place</i>, is a faculty necessarily following the other.
For in vain were it otherwise to desire and to abhor, if we had not
likewise power to prosecute or eschew, by moving the body from place to
place: by this faculty therefore we locally move the body, or any part of
it, and go from one place to another. To the better performance of which,
three things are requisite: that which moves; by what it moves; that which
is moved. That which moves, is either the efficient cause, or end. The end
is the object, which is desired or eschewed; as in a dog to catch a hare,
&amp;c. The efficient cause in man is reason, or his subordinate phantasy,
which apprehends good or bad objects: in brutes imagination alone, which
moves the appetite, the appetite this faculty, which by an admirable league
of nature, and by meditation of the spirit, commands the organ by which it
moves: and that consists of nerves, muscles, cords, dispersed through the
whole body, contracted and relaxed as the spirits will, which move the
muscles, or <a href="#note993">[993]</a>nerves in the midst of them, and draw the cord, and so
<span lang="la">per consequens</span> the joint, to the place intended. That which is moved, is
the body or some member apt to move. The motion of the body is divers, as
going, running, leaping, dancing, sitting, and such like, referred to the
predicament of <span lang="la">situs</span>. Worms creep, birds fly, fishes swim; and so of
parts, the chief of which is respiration or breathing, and is thus
performed. The outward air is drawn in by the vocal artery, and sent by
mediation of the midriff to the lungs, which, dilating themselves as a pair
of bellows, reciprocally fetch it in, and send it out to the heart to cool
it; and from thence now being hot, convey it again, still taking in fresh.
Such a like motion is that of the pulse, of which, because many have
written whole books, I will say nothing.

<h4><a name="1.1.2.9"></a>SUBSECT. IX.&mdash;<i>Of the Rational Soul.</i></h4>

<p>In the precedent subsections I have anatomised those inferior faculties of
the soul; the rational remaineth, <q>a pleasant, but a doubtful subject</q> (as
<a href="#note994">[994]</a>one terms it), and with the like brevity to be discussed. Many
erroneous opinions are about the essence and original of it; whether it be
fire, as Zeno held; harmony, as Aristoxenus; number, as Xenocrates; whether
it be organical, or inorganical; seated in the brain, heart or blood;
mortal or immortal; how it comes into the body. Some hold that it is <span lang="la">ex
traduce</span>, as <span class="cite">Phil. 1. de Anima</span>, Tertullian, Lactantius <span class="cite">de opific. Dei,
cap. 19.</span> Hugo, <span class="cite">lib. de Spiritu et Anima</span>, Vincentius Bellavic. <span class="cite">spec.
natural. lib. 23. cap. 2. et 11.</span> Hippocrates, Avicenna, and many <a href="#note995">[995]</a>
late writers; that one man begets another, body and soul; or as a candle
from a candle, to be produced from the seed: otherwise, say they, a man
begets but half a man, and is worse than a beast that begets both matter
and form; and, besides, the three faculties of the soul must be together
infused, which is most absurd as they hold, because in beasts they are
begot, the two inferior I mean, and may not be well separated in men. <a href="#note996">[996]</a>
Galen supposeth the soul <span lang="la">crasin esse</span>, to be the temperature itself;
Trismegistus, Musaeus, Orpheus, Homer, Pindarus, Phaerecides Syrus,
Epictetus, with the Chaldees and Egyptians, affirmed the soul to be
immortal, as did those British <a href="#note997">[997]</a>Druids of old. The <a href="#note998">[998]</a>Pythagoreans
defend Metempsychosis; and Palingenesia, that souls go from one body to
another, <span lang="la">epota prius Lethes unda</span>, as men into wolves, bears, dogs, hogs,
as they were inclined in their lives, or participated in conditions:

<div class="line">Ille ego (nam memini) Trojani tempore belli,</div>
<div class="line">Panthoides Euphorbus eram,</div>
</div>
a horse, a man, a sponge. <a href="#note1001">[1001]</a>Julian the Apostate thought Alexander's
soul was descended into his body: Plato in Timaeo, and in his Phaedon, (for
aught I can perceive,) differs not much from this opinion, that it was from
God at first, and knew all, but being enclosed in the body, it forgets, and
learns anew, which he calls <span lang="la">reminiscentia</span>, or recalling, and that it was
put into the body for a punishment; and thence it goes into a beast's, or
man's, as appears by his pleasant fiction <span class="cite">de sortitione animarum, lib.

Others deny the immortality of it, which Pomponatus of Padua decided out of
Aristotle not long since, Plinias Avunculus, <span class="cite">cap. 1. lib. 2, et lib. 7.

</div>
Averroes, and I know not how many Neoterics. <a href="#note1005">[1005]</a><q>This question of the
immortality of the soul, is diversely and wonderfully impugned and disputed,
especially among the Italians of late,</q> saith Jab. Colerus, <span class="cite">lib. de
immort. animae, cap. 1.</span> The popes themselves have doubted of it: Leo
Decimus, that Epicurean pope, as <a href="#note1006">[1006]</a>some record of him, caused this
question to be discussed pro and con before him, and concluded at last,
as a profane and atheistical moderator, with that verse of Cornelius
Gallus, 
<div class="poem" lang="la">Et redit in nihilum, quod fuit ante nihil.</div>
It began of nothing,
and in nothing it ends. Zeno and his Stoics, as <a href="#note1007">[1007]</a>Austin quotes him,
supposed the soul so long to continue, till the body was fully putrified,
and resolved into <span lang="la">materia prima</span>: but after that, <span lang="la">in fumos evanescere</span>,
to be extinguished and vanished; and in the meantime, whilst the body was
consuming, it wandered all abroad, <span lang="la">et e longinquo multa annunciare</span>, and
(as that Clazomenian Hermotimus averred) saw pretty visions, and suffered I
know not what. 
<div class="poem" lang="la"><a href="#note1008">[1008]</a>Errant exangues sine corpore et ossibus umbrae.</div>
Others grant the immortality thereof, but they make many fabulous fictions
in the meantime of it, after the departure from the body: like Plato's
Elysian fields, and that Turkey paradise. The souls of good men they
deified; the bad (saith <a href="#note1009">[1009]</a>Austin) became devils, as they supposed;
with many such absurd tenets, which he hath confuted. Hierome, Austin, and
other Fathers of the church, hold that the soul is immortal, created of
nothing, and so infused into the child or embryo in his mother's womb, six
months after the <a href="#note1010">[1010]</a>conception; not as those of brutes, which are <span lang="la">ex
traduce</span>, and dying with them vanish into nothing. To whose divine
treatises, and to the Scriptures themselves, I rejourn all such atheistical
spirits, as Tully did Atticus, doubting of this point, to Plato's Phaedon.
Or if they desire philosophical proofs and demonstrations, I refer them to
Niphus, Nic. Faventinus' tracts of this subject. To Fran. and John Picus <span class="cite">in
digress: sup. 3. de Anima</span>, Tholosanus, Eugubinus, To. Soto, Canas, Thomas,
Peresius, Dandinus, Colerus, to that elaborate tract in Zanchius, to
Tolet's Sixty Reasons, and Lessius' Twenty-two Arguments, to prove the
immortality of the soul. Campanella, <span class="cite">lib. de sensu rerum</span>, is large in the
same discourse, Albertinus the Schoolman, Jacob. Nactantus, <span class="cite">tom. 2. op.</span>
handleth it in four questions, Antony Brunus, Aonius Palearius, Marinus
Marcennus, with many others. This reasonable soul, which Austin calls a
spiritual substance moving itself, is defined by philosophers to be <q>the
first substantial act of a natural, humane, organical body, by which a man
lives, perceives, and understands, freely doing all things, and with
election.</q> Out of which definition we may gather, that this rational soul
includes the powers, and performs the duties of the two other, which are
contained in it, and all three faculties make one soul, which is
inorganical of itself, although it be in all parts, and incorporeal, using
their organs, and working by them. It is divided into two chief parts,
differing in office only, not in essence. The understanding, which is the
rational power apprehending; the will, which is the rational power moving:
to which two, all the other rational powers are subject and reduced.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.2.10"></a>SUBSECT. X.&mdash;<i>Of the Understanding</i>.</h4>

<p><q>Understanding is a power of the soul, <a href="#note1011">[1011]</a>by which we perceive, know,
remember, and judge as well singulars, as universals, having certain innate
notices or beginnings of arts, a reflecting action, by which it judgeth of
his own doings, and examines them.</q> Out of this definition (besides his
chief office, which is to apprehend, judge all that he performs, without
the help of any instruments or organs) three differences appear betwixt a
man and a beast. As first, the sense only comprehends singularities, the
understanding universalities. Secondly, the sense hath no innate notions.
Thirdly, brutes cannot reflect upon themselves. Bees indeed make neat and
curious works, and many other creatures besides; but when they have done,
they cannot judge of them. His object is God, <span lang="la">ens</span>, all nature, and
whatsoever is to be understood: which successively it apprehends. The
object first moving the understanding, is some sensible thing; after by
discoursing, the mind finds out the corporeal substance, and from thence
the spiritual. His actions (some say) are apprehension, composition,
division, discoursing, reasoning, memory, which some include in invention,
and judgment. The common divisions are of the understanding, agent, and
patient; speculative, and practical; in habit, or in act; simple, or
compound. The agent is that which is called the wit of man, acumen or
subtlety, sharpness of invention, when he doth invent of himself without a
teacher, or learns anew, which abstracts those intelligible species from
the phantasy, and transfers them to the passive understanding, <a href="#note1012">[1012]</a>
<q>because there is nothing in the understanding, which was not first in the
sense.</q> That which the imagination hath taken from the sense, this agent
judgeth of, whether it be true or false; and being so judged he commits it
to the passible to be kept. The agent is a doctor or teacher, the passive a
scholar; and his office is to keep and further judge of such things as are
committed to his charge; as a bare and rased table at first, capable of all
forms and notions. Now these notions are twofold, actions or habits:
actions, by which we take notions of, and perceive things; habits, which
are durable lights and notions, which we may use when we will. Some reckon
up eight kinds of them, sense, experience, intelligence, faith, suspicion,
error, opinion, science; to which are added art, prudency, wisdom: as also
<a href="#note1013">[1013]</a>synteresis, <span lang="la">dictamen rationis</span>, conscience; so that in all there be
fourteen species of the understanding, of which some are innate, as the
three last mentioned; the other are gotten by doctrine, learning, and use.
Plato will have all to be innate: Aristotle reckons up but five
intellectual habits; two practical, as prudency, whose end is to practise;
to fabricate; wisdom to comprehend the use and experiments of all notions
and habits whatsoever. Which division of Aristotle (if it be considered
aright) is all one with the precedent; for three being innate, and five
acquisite, the rest are improper, imperfect, and in a more strict
examination excluded. Of all these I should more amply dilate, but my
subject will not permit. Three of them I will only point at, as more
necessary to my following discourse.

<p>Synteresis, or the purer part of the conscience, is an innate habit, and
doth signify <q>a conversation of the knowledge of the law of God and Nature,
to know good or evil.</q> And (as our divines hold) it is rather in the
understanding than in the will. This makes the major proposition in a
practical syllogism. The <span lang="la">dictamen rationis</span> is that which doth admonish us
to do good or evil, and is the minor in the syllogism. The conscience is
that which approves good or evil, justifying or condemning our actions, and
is the conclusion of the syllogism: as in that familiar example of Regulus
the Roman, taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, and suffered to go to Rome,
on that condition he should return again, or pay so much for his ransom.
The synteresis proposeth the question; his word, oath, promise, is to be
religiously kept, although to his enemy, and that by the law of nature.
<a href="#note1014">[1014]</a><q>Do not that to another which thou wouldst not have done to
thyself.</q> Dictamen applies it to him, and dictates this or the like:
Regulus, thou wouldst not another man should falsify his oath, or break
promise with thee: conscience concludes, therefore, Regulus, thou dost well
to perform thy promise, and oughtest to keep thine oath. More of this in
Religious Melancholy.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.2.11"></a>SUBSECT. XI.&mdash;<i>Of the Will</i>.</h4>

<p>Will is the other power of the rational soul, <a href="#note1015">[1015]</a><q>which covets or
avoids such things as have been before judged and apprehended by the
understanding.</q> If good, it approves; if evil, it abhors it: so that his
object is either good or evil. Aristotle calls this our rational appetite;
for as, in the sensitive, we are moved to good or bad by our appetite,
ruled and directed by sense; so in this we are carried by reason. Besides,
the sensitive appetite hath a particular object, good or bad; this an
universal, immaterial: that respects only things delectable and pleasant;
this honest. Again, they differ in liberty. The sensual appetite seeing an
object, if it be a convenient good, cannot but desire it; if evil, avoid
it: but this is free in his essence, <a href="#note1016">[1016]</a><q>much now depraved, obscured,
and fallen from his first perfection; yet in some of his operations still
free,</q> as to go, walk, move at his pleasure, and to choose whether it will
do or not do, steal or not steal. Otherwise, in vain were laws,
deliberations, exhortations, counsels, precepts, rewards, promises, threats
and punishments: and God should be the author of sin. But in <a href="#note1017">[1017]</a>
spiritual things we will no good, prone to evil (except we be regenerate,
and led by the Spirit), we are egged on by our natural concupiscence, and
there is <span lang="gr">&#x1F00;&tau;&alpha;&xi;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span>, a confusion in our powers, <a href="#note1018">[1018]</a><q>our whole will
is averse from God and his law,</q> not in natural things only, as to eat and
drink, lust, to which we are led headlong by our temperature and inordinate
appetite,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1019">[1019]</a>Nec nos obniti contra, nec tendere tantum</div>
<div class="line">Sufficimus,&mdash;</div>
</div>
we cannot resist, our concupiscence is originally bad, our heart evil, the
seat of our affections captivates and enforceth our will. So that in
voluntary things we are averse from God and goodness, bad by nature, by
<a href="#note1020">[1020]</a>ignorance worse, by art, discipline, custom, we get many bad habits:
suffering them to domineer and tyrannise over us; and the devil is still
ready at hand with his evil suggestions, to tempt our depraved will to some
ill-disposed action, to precipitate us to destruction, except our will be
swayed and counterpoised again with some divine precepts, and good motions
of the spirit, which many times restrain, hinder and check us, when we are
in the full career of our dissolute courses. So David corrected himself,
when he had Saul at a vantage. Revenge and malice were as two violent
oppugners on the one side; but honesty, religion, fear of God, withheld him
on the other.

<p>The actions of the will are <span lang="la">velle</span> and <span lang="la">nolle</span>, to will and nill: which
two words comprehend all, and they are good or bad, accordingly as they are
directed, and some of them freely performed by himself; although the stoics
absolutely deny it, and will have all things inevitably done by destiny,
imposing a fatal necessity upon us, which we may not resist; yet we say
that our will is free in respect of us, and things contingent, howsoever in
respect of God's determinate counsel, they are inevitable and necessary.
Some other actions of the will are performed by the inferior powers, which
obey him, as the sensitive and moving appetite; as to open our eyes, to go
hither and thither, not to touch a book, to speak fair or foul: but this
appetite is many times rebellious in us, and will not be contained within
the lists of sobriety and temperance. It was (as I said) once well agreeing
with reason, and there was an excellent consent and harmony between them,
but that is now dissolved, they often jar, reason is overborne by passion:
<span lang="la">Fertur equis auriga, nec audit currus habenas,</span>
as so many wild horses run
away with a chariot, and will not be curbed. We know many times what is
good, but will not do it, as she said,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1021">[1021]</a>Trahit invitum nova vis, aliudque cupido,</div>
<div class="line">Mens aliud suadet,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
Lust counsels one thing, reason another, there is a new reluctancy in men.
<a href="#note1022">[1022]</a><span lang="la">Odi, nec possum, cupiens non esse, quod odi.</span>
We cannot resist, but
as Phaedra confessed to her nurse, <a href="#note1023">[1023]</a><span lang="la">quae loqueris, vera sunt, sed
furor suggerit sequi pejora</span>: she said well and true, she did acknowledge
it, but headstrong passion and fury made her to do that which was opposite.
So David knew the filthiness of his fact, what a loathsome, foul, crying
sin adultery was, yet notwithstanding he would commit murder, and take away
another man's wife, enforced against reason, religion, to follow his
appetite.

<p>Those natural and vegetal powers are not commanded by will at all; for <q>who
can add one cubit to his stature?</q> These other may, but are not: and thence
come all those headstrong passions, violent perturbations of the mind; and
many times vicious habits, customs, feral diseases; because we give so much
way to our appetite, and follow our inclination, like so many beasts. The
principal habits are two in number, virtue and vice, whose peculiar
definitions, descriptions, differences, and kinds, are handled at large in
the ethics, and are, indeed, the subject of moral philosophy.

<h4><a name="1.1.3.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Definition of Melancholy, Name, Difference</i>.</h4>

<p>Having thus briefly anatomised the body and soul of man, as a preparative
to the rest; I may now freely proceed to treat of my intended object, to
most men's capacity; and after many ambages, perspicuously define what this
melancholy is, show his name and differences. The name is imposed from the
matter, and disease denominated from the material cause: as Bruel observes,
<span lang="gr">&Mu;&epsilon;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&chi;&omicron;&lambda;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span> quasi <span lang="gr">&Mu;&epsilon;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&alpha;&chi;&#x1F79;&lambda;&eta;</span>, from black choler. And
whether it be a cause or an effect, a disease or symptom, let Donatus
Altomarus and Salvianus decide; I will not contend about it. It hath
several descriptions, notations, and definitions. <a href="#note1024">[1024]</a>Fracastorius, in
his second book of intellect, calls those melancholy, <q>whom abundance of
that same depraved humour of black choler hath so misaffected, that they
become mad thence, and dote in most things, or in all, belonging to
election, will, or other manifest operations of the understanding.</q> <a href="#note1025">[1025]</a>
Melanelius out of Galen, Ruffus, Aetius, describe it to be <q>a bad and
peevish disease, which makes men degenerate into beasts:</q> Galen, <q>a
privation or infection of the middle cell of the head, &amp;c.</q> defining it
from the part affected, which <a href="#note1026">[1026]</a>Hercules de Saxonia approves, <span class="cite">lib.
1. cap. 16.</span> calling it <q>a depravation of the principal function:</q>
Fuschius, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 23.</span> Arnoldus <span class="cite">Breviar. lib. 1. cap. 18.</span>
Guianerius, and others: <q>By reason of black choler,</q> Paulus adds. Halyabbas
simply calls it a <q>commotion of the mind.</q> Aretaeus, <a href="#note1027">[1027]</a><q>a perpetual
anguish of the soul, fastened on one thing, without an ague;</q> which
definition of his, Mercurialis <span class="cite">de affect. cap. lib. 1. cap. 10.</span> taxeth:
but Aelianus Montaltus defends, <span class="cite">lib. de morb. cap. 1. de Melan.</span> for
sufficient and good. The common sort define it to be <q>a kind of dotage
without a fever, having for his ordinary companions, fear and sadness,
without any apparent occasion.</q> So doth Laurentius, <span class="cite">cap. 4.</span> Piso. <span class="cite">lib.
1. cap. 43.</span> Donatus Altomarus, <span class="cite">cap. 7. art. medic</span>. Jacchinus, <span class="cite">in com.
in lib. 9. Rhasis ad Almansor, cap. 15.</span> Valesius, <span class="cite">exerc. 17.</span> Fuschius,
<span class="cite">institut. 3. sec. 1. c. 11.</span> &amp;c. which common definition, howsoever
approved by most, <a href="#note1028">[1028]</a>Hercules de Saxonia will not allow of, nor David
Crucius, <span class="cite">Theat. morb. Herm. lib. 2. cap. 6.</span> he holds it insufficient:
as <a href="#note1029">[1029]</a>rather showing what it is not, than what it is: as omitting the
specific difference, the phantasy and brain: but I descend to particulars.
The <span lang="la">summum genus</span> is <q>dotage, or anguish of the mind,</q> saith Aretaeus; <q>of
the principal parts,</q> Hercules de Saxonia adds, to distinguish it from
cramp and palsy, and such diseases as belong to the outward sense and
motions [depraved] <a href="#note1030">[1030]</a>to distinguish it from folly and madness (which
Montaltus makes <span lang="la">angor animi</span>, to separate) in which those functions are
not depraved, but rather abolished; [without an ague] is added by all, to
sever it from frenzy, and that melancholy which is in a pestilent fever.
(Fear and sorrow) make it differ from madness: [without a cause] is lastly
inserted, to specify it from all other ordinary passions of [fear and
sorrow.] We properly call that dotage, as <a href="#note1031">[1031]</a>Laurentius interprets it,
<q>when some one principal faculty of the mind, as imagination, or reason, is
corrupted, as all melancholy persons have.</q> It is without a fever, because
the humour is most part cold and dry, contrary to putrefaction. Fear and
sorrow are the true characters and inseparable companions of most
melancholy, not all, as Her. de Saxonia, <span class="cite">Tract. de posthumo de
Melancholia, cap. 2.</span> well excepts; for to some it is most pleasant, as to
such as laugh most part; some are bold again, and free from all manner of
fear and grief, as hereafter shall be declared.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.3.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Of the part affected. Affection. Parties affected</i>.</h4>

<p>Some difference I find amongst writers, about the principal part affected
in this disease, whether it be the brain, or heart, or some other member.
Most are of opinion that it is the brain: for being a kind of dotage, it
cannot otherwise be but that the brain must be affected, as a similar part,
be it by <a href="#note1032">[1032]</a>consent or essence, not in his ventricles, or any
obstructions in them, for then it would be an apoplexy, or epilepsy, as
<a href="#note1033">[1033]</a>Laurentius well observes, but in a cold, dry distemperature of it in
his substance, which is corrupt and become too cold, or too dry, or else
too hot, as in madmen, and such as are inclined to it: and this <a href="#note1034">[1034]</a>
Hippocrates confirms, Galen, the Arabians, and most of our new writers.
Marcus de Oddis (in a consultation of his, quoted by <a href="#note1035">[1035]</a>Hildesheim) and
five others there cited are of the contrary part; because fear and sorrow,
which are passions, be seated in the heart. But this objection is
sufficiently answered by <a href="#note1036">[1036]</a>Montaltus, who doth not deny that the heart
is affected (as <a href="#note1037">[1037]</a>Melanelius proves out of Galen) by reason of his
vicinity, and so is the midriff and many other parts. They do <span lang="la">compati</span>,
and have a fellow feeling by the law of nature: but forasmuch as this
malady is caused by precedent imagination, with the appetite, to whom
spirits obey, and are subject to those principal parts, the brain must
needs primarily be misaffected, as the seat of reason; and then the heart,
as the seat of affection. <a href="#note1038">[1038]</a>Capivaccius and Mercurialis have
copiously discussed this question, and both conclude the subject is the
inner brain, and from thence it is communicated to the heart and other
inferior parts, which sympathise and are much troubled, especially when it
comes by consent, and is caused by reason of the stomach, or <span lang="la">mirach</span>, as the
Arabians term it, whole body, liver, or <a href="#note1039">[1039]</a>spleen, which are seldom
free, pylorus, mesaraic veins, &amp;c. For our body is like a clock, if one
wheel be amiss, all the rest are disordered; the whole fabric suffers: with
such admirable art and harmony is a man composed, such excellent
proportion, as Ludovicus Vives in his Fable of Man hath elegantly declared.

<p>As many doubts almost arise about the <a href="#note1040">[1040]</a>affection, whether it be
imagination or reason alone, or both, Hercules de Saxonia proves it out of
Galen, Aetius, and Altomarus, that the sole fault is in <a href="#note1041">[1041]</a>imagination.
Bruel is of the same mind: Montaltus in his <span class="cite">2 cap.</span> of Melancholy confutes
this tenet of theirs, and illustrates the contrary by many examples: as of
him that thought himself a shellfish, of a nun, and of a desperate monk
that would not be persuaded but that he was damned; reason was in fault as
well as imagination, which did not correct this error: they make away
themselves oftentimes, and suppose many absurd and ridiculous things. Why
doth not reason detect the fallacy, settle and persuade, if she be free?
<a href="#note1042">[1042]</a>Avicenna therefore holds both corrupt, to whom most Arabians
subscribe. The same is maintained by <a href="#note1043">[1043]</a>Areteus, <a href="#note1044">[1044]</a>Gorgonius,
Guianerius, &amp;c. To end the controversy, no man doubts of imagination, but
that it is hurt and misaffected here; for the other I determine with <a href="#note1045">[1045]</a>
Albertinus Bottonus, a doctor of Padua, that it is first in <q>imagination,
and afterwards in reason; if the disease be inveterate, or as it is more or
less of continuance;</q> but by accident, as <a href="#note1046">[1046]</a>Herc. de Saxonia adds;
<q>faith, opinion, discourse, ratiocination, are all accidentally depraved by
the default of imagination.</q>

<p><a name="index11"></a><i>Parties affected</i>.] To the part affected, I may here add the parties,
which shall be more opportunely spoken of elsewhere, now only signified.
Such as have the moon, Saturn, Mercury misaffected in their genitures, such
as live in over cold or over hot climes: such as are born of melancholy
parents; as offend in those six non-natural things, are black, or of a high
sanguine complexion, <a href="#note1047">[1047]</a>that have little heads, that have a hot heart,
moist brain, hot liver and cold stomach, have been long sick: such as are
solitary by nature, great students, given to much contemplation, lead a
life out of action, are most subject to melancholy. Of sexes both, but men
more often; yet <a href="#note1048">[1048]</a>women misaffected are far more violent, and
grievously troubled. Of seasons of the year, the autumn is most melancholy.
Of peculiar times: old age, from which natural melancholy is almost an
inseparable accident; but this artificial malady is more frequent in such
as are of a <a href="#note1049">[1049]</a>middle age. Some assign 40 years, Gariopontus 30.
Jubertus excepts neither young nor old from this adventitious. Daniel
Sennertus involves all of all sorts, out of common experience, <a href="#note1050">[1050]</a><span lang="la">in
omnibus omnino corporibus cujuscunque constitutionis dominatar</span>. Aetius and
Aretius <a href="#note1051">[1051]</a>ascribe into the number <q>not only <a href="#note1052">[1052]</a>discontented,
passionate, and miserable persons, swarthy, black; but such as are most
merry and pleasant, scoffers, and high coloured.</q> <q>Generally,</q> saith
Rhasis, <a href="#note1053">[1053]</a><q>the finest wits and most generous spirits, are before other
obnoxious to it;</q> I cannot except any complexion, any condition, sex, or
age, but <a href="#note1054">[1054]</a>fools and stoics, which, according to <a href="#note1055">[1055]</a>Synesius, are
never troubled with any manner of passion, but as Anacreon's <span lang="la">cicada, sine
sanguine et dolore; similes fere diis sunt</span>. Erasmus vindicates fools from
this melancholy catalogue, because they have most part moist brains and
light hearts; <a href="#note1056">[1056]</a>they are free from ambition, envy, shame and fear;
they are neither troubled in conscience, nor macerated with cares, to which
our whole life is most subject.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.3.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Of the Matter of Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>Of the matter of melancholy, there is much question betwixt Avicen and
Galen, as you may read in <a href="#note1057">[1057]</a>Cardan's Contradictions, <a href="#note1058">[1058]</a>Valesius'
Controversies, Montanus, Prosper Calenus, Capivaccius, <a href="#note1059">[1059]</a>Bright,
<a href="#note1060">[1060]</a>Ficinus, that have written either whole tracts, or copiously of it,
in their several treatises of this subject. <a href="#note1061">[1061]</a><q>What this humour is, or
whence it proceeds, how it is engendered in the body, neither Galen, nor
any old writer hath sufficiently discussed,</q> as Jacchinus thinks: the
Neoterics cannot agree. Montanus, in his Consultations, holds melancholy to
be material or immaterial: and so doth Arculanus: the material is one of
the four humours before mentioned, and natural. The immaterial or
adventitious, acquisite, redundant, unnatural, artificial; which <a href="#note1062">[1062]</a>
Hercules de Saxonia will have reside in the spirits alone, and to proceed
from a <q>hot, cold, dry, moist distemperature, which, without matter, alter
the brain and functions of it.</q> Paracelsus wholly rejects and derides this
division of four humours and complexions, but our Galenists generally
approve of it, subscribing to this opinion of Montanus.

<p>This material melancholy is either simple or mixed; offending in quantity
or quality, varying according to his place, where it settleth, as brain,
spleen, mesaraic veins, heart, womb, and stomach; or differing according to
the mixture of those natural humours amongst themselves, or four unnatural
adust humours, as they are diversely tempered and mingled. If natural
melancholy abound in the body, which is cold and dry, <q>so that it be more
<a href="#note1063">[1063]</a>than the body is well able to bear, it must needs be distempered,</q>
saith Faventius, <q>and diseased;</q> and so the other, if it be depraved,
whether it arise from that other melancholy of choler adust, or from blood,
produceth the like effects, and is, as Montaltus contends, if it come by
adustion of humours, most part hot and dry. Some difference I find, whether
this melancholy matter may be engendered of all four humours, about the
colour and temper of it. Galen holds it may be engendered of three alone,
excluding phlegm, or pituita, whose true assertion <a href="#note1064">[1064]</a>Valesius and
Menardus stiffly maintain, and so doth <a href="#note1065">[1065]</a>Fuschius, Montaltus, <a href="#note1066">[1066]</a>
Montanus. How (say they) can white become black? But Hercules de Saxonia,
<span class="cite">lib. post. de mela. c. 8</span>, and <a href="#note1067">[1067]</a>Cardan are of the opposite part (it
may be engendered of phlegm, <span lang="la">etsi raro contingat</span>, though it seldom come
to pass), so is <a href="#note1068">[1068]</a>Guianerius and Laurentius, <span class="cite">c. 1.</span> with Melanct. in
his book <span class="cite">de Anima</span>, and Chap. of Humours; he calls it <span lang="la">asininam</span>, dull,
swinish melancholy, and saith that he was an eyewitness of it: so is
<a href="#note1069">[1069]</a>Wecker. From melancholy adust ariseth one kind; from choler another,
which is most brutish; another from phlegm, which is dull; and the last
from blood, which is best. Of these some are cold and dry, others hot and
dry, <a href="#note1070">[1070]</a>varying according to their mixtures, as they are intended, and
remitted. And indeed as Rodericus a Fons. <span class="cite">cons. 12. l. 1.</span> determines, ichors,
and those serous matters being thickened become phlegm, and phlegm
degenerates into choler, choler adust becomes <span lang="la">aeruginosa melancholia</span>, as
vinegar out of purest wine putrified or by exhalation of purer spirits is
so made, and becomes sour and sharp; and from the sharpness of this humour
proceeds much waking, troublesome thoughts and dreams, &amp;c. so that I
conclude as before. If the humour be cold, it is, saith <a href="#note1071">[1071]</a>Faventinus,
<q>a cause of dotage, and produceth milder symptoms: if hot, they are rash,
raving mad, or inclining to it.</q> If the brain be hot, the animal spirits
are hot; much madness follows, with violent actions: if cold, fatuity and
sottishness, <a href="#note1072">[1072]</a>Capivaccius. <a href="#note1073">[1073]</a><q>The colour of this mixture varies
likewise according to the mixture, be it hot or cold; 'tis sometimes black,
sometimes not,</q> Altomarus. The same <a href="#note1074">[1074]</a>Melanelius proves out of Galen;
and Hippocrates in his Book of Melancholy (if at least it be his), giving
instance in a burning coal, <q>which when it is hot, shines; when it is cold,
looks black; and so doth the humour.</q> This diversity of melancholy matter
produceth diversity of effects. If it be within the <a href="#note1075">[1075]</a>body, and not
putrified, it causeth black jaundice; if putrified, a quartan ague; if it
break out to the skin, leprosy; if to parts, several maladies, as scurvy,
&amp;c. If it trouble the mind; as it is diversely mixed, it produceth several
kinds of madness and dotage: of which in their place.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.1.3.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Of the species or kinds of Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>When the matter is divers and confused, how should it otherwise be, but
that the species should be divers and confused? Many new and old writers
have spoken confusedly of it, confounding melancholy and madness, as <a href="#note1076">[1076]</a>
Heurnius, Guianerius, Gordonius, Salustius Salvianus, Jason Pratensis,
Savanarola, that will have madness no other than melancholy in extent,
differing (as I have said) in degrees. Some make two distinct species, as
Ruffus Ephesius, an old writer, Constantinus Africanus, Aretaeus, <a href="#note1077">[1077]</a>
Aurelianus, <a href="#note1078">[1078]</a>Paulus Aegineta: others acknowledge a multitude of kinds,
and leave them indefinite, as Aetius in his <span class="cite">Tetrabiblos</span>, <a href="#note1079">[1079]</a>Avicenna,
<span class="cite">lib. 3. Fen. 1. Tract. 4. cap. 18.</span> Arculanus, <span class="cite">cap. 16. in 9.
Rasis</span>. Montanus, <span class="cite">med. part. 1.</span> <a href="#note1080">[1080]</a><q>If natural melancholy be adust, it
maketh one kind; if blood, another; if choler, a third, differing from the
first; and so many several opinions there are about the kinds, as there be
men themselves.</q> <a href="#note1081">[1081]</a>Hercules de Saxonia sets down two kinds, <q>material
and immaterial; one from spirits alone, the other from humours and
spirits.</q> Savanarola, <span class="cite">Rub. 11. Tract. 6. cap. 1. de aegritud.
capitis</span>, will have the kinds to be infinite; one from the mirach, called
<span lang="la">myrachialis</span> of the Arabians; another <span lang="la">stomachalis</span>, from the stomach; another
from the liver, heart, womb, haemorrhoids, <a href="#note1082">[1082]</a><q>one beginning, another
consummate.</q> Melancthon seconds him, <a href="#note1083">[1083]</a><q>as the humour is diversely
adust and mixed, so are the species divers;</q> but what these men speak of
species I think ought to be understood of symptoms; and so doth <a href="#note1084">[1084]</a>
Arculanus interpret himself: infinite species, <span lang="la">id est</span>, symptoms; and in
that sense, as Jo. Gorrheus acknowledgeth in his medicinal definitions, the
species are infinite, but they may be reduced to three kinds by reason of
their seat; head, body, and hypochrondries. This threefold division is
approved by Hippocrates in his Book of Melancholy, (if it be his, which
some suspect) by Galen, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de loc. affectis, cap. 6.</span> by Alexander,
<span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 16.</span> Rasis, <span class="cite">lib. 1. Continent. Tract. 9. lib. 1.
cap. 16.</span> Avicenna and most of our new writers. Th. Erastus makes two
kinds; one perpetual, which is head melancholy; the other interrupt, which
comes and goes by fits, which he subdivides into the other two kinds, so
that all comes to the same pass. Some again make four or five kinds, with
Rodericus a Castro, <span class="cite">de morbis mulier. lib. 2. cap. 3.</span> and Lod.
Mercatus, who in his second book <span class="cite">de mulier. affect. cap. 4.</span> will have
that melancholy of nuns, widows, and more ancient maids, to be a peculiar
species of melancholy differing from the rest: some will reduce
enthusiasts, ecstatical and demoniacal persons to this rank, adding <a href="#note1085">[1085]</a>
love melancholy to the first, and lycanthropia. The most received division
is into three kinds. The first proceeds from the sole fault of the brain,
and is called head melancholy; the second sympathetically proceeds from the
whole body, when the whole temperature is melancholy: the third ariseth
from the bowels, liver, spleen, or membrane, called <span lang="la">mesenterium</span>, named
hypochondriacal or windy melancholy, which <a href="#note1086">[1086]</a>Laurentius subdivides
into three parts, from those three members, hepatic, splenetic, mesaraic.
Love melancholy, which Avicenna calls <span lang="la">ilishi</span>: and Lycanthropia, which he
calls <span lang="la">cucubuthe</span>, are commonly included in head melancholy; but of this
last, which Gerardus de Solo calls <span lang="la">amoreus</span>, and most knight melancholy,
with that of religious melancholy, <span lang="la">virginum et viduarum</span>, maintained by
Rod. a Castro and Mercatus, and the other kinds of love melancholy, I will
speak of apart by themselves in my third partition. The three precedent
species are the subject of my present discourse, which I will anatomise and
treat of through all their causes, symptoms, cures, together and apart;
that every man that is in any measure affected with this malady, may know
how to examine it in himself, and apply remedies unto it.

<p>It is a hard matter, I confess, to distinguish these three species one from
the other, to express their several causes, symptoms, cures, being that
they are so often confounded amongst themselves, having such affinity, that
they can scarce be discerned by the most accurate physicians; and so often
intermixed with other diseases, that the best experienced have been
plunged. Montanus <span class="cite">consil. 26</span>, names a patient that had this disease of
melancholy and caninus appetitus both together; and <span class="cite">consil. 23</span>, with
vertigo, <a href="#note1087">[1087]</a>Julius Caesar Claudinus with stone, gout, jaundice.
Trincavellius with an ague, jaundice, caninus appetitus, &amp;c. <a href="#note1088">[1088]</a>Paulus
Regoline, a great doctor in his time, consulted in this case, was so
confounded with a confusion of symptoms, that he knew not to what kind of
melancholy to refer it. <a href="#note1089">[1089]</a>Trincavellius, Fallopius, and Francanzanus,
famous doctors in Italy, all three conferred with about one party, at the
same time, gave three different opinions. And in another place,
Trincavellius being demanded what he thought of a melancholy young man to
whom he was sent for, ingenuously confessed that he was indeed melancholy,
but he knew not to what kind to reduce it. In his seventeenth consultation
there is the like disagreement about a melancholy monk. Those symptoms,
which others ascribe to misaffected parts and humours, <a href="#note1090">[1090]</a>Herc. de
Saxonia attributes wholly to distempered spirits, and those immaterial, as
I have said. Sometimes they cannot well discern this disease from others.
In Reinerus Solenander's counsels, (<span class="cite">Sect, consil. 5</span>,) he and Dr. Brande
both agreed, that the patient's disease was hypochondriacal melancholy. Dr.
Matholdus said it was asthma, and nothing else. <a href="#note1091">[1091]</a>Solenander and
Guarionius, lately sent for to the melancholy Duke of Cleve, with others,
could not define what species it was, or agree amongst themselves. The
species are so confounded, as in Caesar Claudinus his forty-fourth
consultation for a Polonian Count, in his judgment <a href="#note1092">[1092]</a><q>he laboured of
head melancholy, and that which proceeds from the whole temperature both at
once.</q> I could give instance of some that have had all three kinds <span lang="la">semel
et simul</span>, and some successively. So that I conclude of our melancholy
species, as <a href="#note1093">[1093]</a>many politicians do of their pure forms of
commonwealths, monarchies, aristocracies, democracies, are most famous in
contemplation, but in practice they are temperate and usually mixed, (so
<a href="#note1094">[1094]</a>Polybius informeth us) as the Lacedaemonian, the Roman of old,
German now, and many others. What physicians say of distinct species in
their books it much matters not, since that in their patients' bodies they
are commonly mixed. In such obscurity, therefore, variety and confused
mixture of symptoms, causes, how difficult a thing is it to treat of
several kinds apart; to make any certainty or distinction among so many
casualties, distractions, when seldom two men shall be like effected <span lang="la">per
omnia</span>? 'Tis hard, I confess, yet nevertheless I will adventure through the
midst of these perplexities, and, led by the clue or thread of the best
writers, extricate myself out of a labyrinth of doubts and errors, and so
proceed to the causes.

<p><q>It is in vain to speak of cures, or think of remedies, until such time as
we have considered of the causes,</q> so <a href="#note1095">[1095]</a>Galen prescribes Glauco: and
the common experience of others confirms that those cures must be
imperfect, lame, and to no purpose, wherein the causes have not first been
searched, as <a href="#note1096">[1096]</a>Prosper Calenius well observes in his tract <span class="cite">de atra
bile</span> to Cardinal Caesius. Insomuch that <a href="#note1097">[1097]</a><q>Fernelius puts a kind of
necessity in the knowledge of the causes, and without which it is
impossible to cure or prevent any manner of disease.</q> Empirics may ease,
and sometimes help, but not thoroughly root out; <span lang="la">sublata causa tollitur
effectus</span> as the saying is, if the cause be removed, the effect is likewise
vanquished. It is a most difficult thing (I confess) to be able to discern
these causes whence they are, and in such <a href="#note1098">[1098]</a>variety to say what the
beginning was. <a href="#note1099">[1099]</a>He is happy that can perform it aright. I will
adventure to guess as near as I can, and rip them all up, from the first to
the last, general and particular, to every species, that so they may the
better be described.

<p>General causes, are either supernatural, or natural. <q>Supernatural are from
God and his angels, or by God's permission from the devil</q> and his
ministers. That God himself is a cause for the punishment of sin, and
satisfaction of his justice, many examples and testimonies of holy
Scriptures make evident unto us, <span class="bibcite">Ps. cvii, 17</span>. <q>Foolish men are plagued for
their offence, and by reason of their wickedness.</q> Gehazi was stricken with
leprosy, <span class="bibcite">2 Reg. v. 27</span>. Jehoram with dysentery and flux, and great diseases
of the bowels, <span class="bibcite">2 Chron. xxi. 15</span>. David plagued for numbering his people, <span class="bibcite">1
Par. 21</span>. Sodom and Gomorrah swallowed up. And this disease is peculiarly
specified, <span class="bibcite">Psalm cxxvii. 12</span>. <q>He brought down their heart through
heaviness.</q> <span class="bibcite">Deut. xxviii. 28</span>. <q>He struck them with madness, blindness, and
astonishment of heart.</q> <a href="#note1100">[1100]</a><q>An evil spirit was sent by the Lord upon
Saul, to vex him.</q> <a href="#note1101">[1101]</a>Nebuchadnezzar did eat grass like an ox, and his
<q>heart was made like the beasts of the field.</q> Heathen stories are full of
such punishments. Lycurgus, because he cut down the vines in the country,
was by Bacchus driven into madness: so was Pentheus and his mother Agave
for neglecting their sacrifice. <a href="#note1102">[1102]</a>Censor Fulvius ran mad for untiling
Juno's temple, to cover a new one of his own, which he had dedicated to
Fortune, <a href="#note1103">[1103]</a><q>and was confounded to death with grief and sorrow of
heart.</q> When Xerxes would have spoiled <a href="#note1104">[1104]</a>Apollo's temple at Delphos of
those infinite riches it possessed, a terrible thunder came from heaven and
struck four thousand men dead, the rest ran mad. <a href="#note1105">[1105]</a>A little after, the
like happened to Brennus, lightning, thunder, earthquakes, upon such a
sacrilegious occasion. If we may believe our pontifical writers, they will
relate unto us many strange and prodigious punishments in this kind,
inflicted by their saints. How <a href="#note1106">[1106]</a>Clodoveus, sometime king of France,
the son of Dagobert, lost his wits for uncovering the body of St. Denis:
and how a <a href="#note1107">[1107]</a>sacrilegious Frenchman, that would have stolen a silver
image of St. John, at Birgburge, became frantic on a sudden, raging, and
tyrannising over his own flesh: of a <a href="#note1108">[1108]</a>Lord of Rhadnor, that coming
from hunting late at night, put his dogs into St. Avan's church, (Llan Avan
they called it) and rising betimes next morning, as hunters use to do,
found all his dogs mad, himself being suddenly strucken blind. Of Tyridates
an <a href="#note1109">[1109]</a>Armenian king, for violating some holy nuns, that was punished in
like sort, with loss of his wits. But poets and papists may go together for
fabulous tales; let them free their own credits: howsoever they feign of
their Nemesis, and of their saints, or by the devil's means may be deluded;
we find it true, that <span lang="la">ultor a tergo Deus</span>, <a href="#note1110">[1110]</a><q>He is God the avenger,</q>
as David styles him; and that it is our crying sins that pull this and many
other maladies on our own heads. That he can by his angels, which are his
ministers, strike and heal (saith <a href="#note1111">[1111]</a>Dionysius) whom he will; that he
can plague us by his creatures, sun, moon, and stars, which he useth as his
instruments, as a husbandman (saith Zanchius) doth a hatchet: hail, snow,
winds, &amp;c.
<a href="#note1112">[1112]</a><span lang="la">Et conjurati veniunt in classica venti</span>:
as in Joshua's time, as in Pharaoh's reign in Egypt; they are but as so many
executioners of his justice. He can make the proudest spirits stoop, and
cry out with Julian the Apostate, <span lang="la">Vicisti Galilaee</span>: or with Apollo's
priest in <a href="#note1113">[1113]</a>Chrysostom, <span lang="la">O coelum! o terra! unde hostis hic</span>? What an
enemy is this? And pray with David, acknowledging his power, <q>I am weakened
and sore broken, I roar for the grief of mine heart, mine heart panteth,</q>
&amp;c. <span class="bibcite">Psalm xxxviii. 8</span>. <q>O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither
chastise me in thy wrath,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psalm xxxviii. 1</span>. <q>Make me to hear joy and
gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken, may rejoice,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psalm li. 8.
and verse 12</span>. <q>Restore to me the joy of thy salvation, and stablish me with
thy free spirit.</q> For these causes belike <a href="#note1114">[1114]</a>Hippocrates would have a
physician take special notice whether the disease come not from a divine
supernatural cause, or whether it follow the course of nature. But this is
farther discussed by Fran. Valesius, <span class="cite">de sacr. philos. cap. 8.</span> <a href="#note1115">[1115]</a>
Fernelius, and <a href="#note1116">[1116]</a>J. Caesar Claudinus, to whom I refer you, how this
place of Hippocrates is to be understood. Paracelsus is of opinion, that
such spiritual diseases (for so he calls them) are spiritually to be cured,
and not otherwise. Ordinary means in such cases will not avail: <span lang="la">Non est
reluctandum cum Deo</span> (we must not struggle with God.) When that
monster-taming Hercules overcame all in the Olympics, Jupiter at last in an
unknown shape wrestled with him; the victory was uncertain, till at length
Jupiter descried himself, and Hercules yielded. No striving with supreme
powers. <span lang="la">Nil juvat immensos Cratero promittere montes</span>, physicians and
physic can do no good, <a href="#note1117">[1117]</a><q>we must submit ourselves unto the mighty
hand of God,</q> acknowledge our offences, call to him for mercy. If he strike
us <span lang="la">una eademque manus vulnus opemque feret</span>, as it is with them that are
wounded with the spear of Achilles, he alone must help; otherwise our
diseases are incurable, and we not to be relieved.

<h4><a name="1.2.1.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>A Digression of the nature of Spirits, bad Angels, or
Devils, and how they cause Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>How far the power of spirits and devils doth extend, and whether they can
cause this, or any other disease, is a serious question, and worthy to be
considered: for the better understanding of which, I will make a brief
digression of the nature of spirits. And although the question be very
obscure, according to <a href="#note1118">[1118]</a>Postellus, <q>full of controversy and ambiguity,</q>
beyond the reach of human capacity, <span lang="la">fateor excedere vires intentionis
meae</span>, saith <a href="#note1119">[1119]</a>Austin, I confess I am not able to understand it,
<span lang="la">finitum de infinito non potest statuere</span>, we can sooner determine with
Tully, <span class="cite">de nat. deorum</span>, <span lang="la">quid non sint, quam quid sint</span>, our subtle
schoolmen, Cardans, Scaligers, profound Thomists, Fracastoriana and
Ferneliana <span lang="la">acies</span>, are weak, dry, obscure, defective in these mysteries,
and all our quickest wits, as an owl's eyes at the sun's light, wax dull,
and are not sufficient to apprehend them; yet, as in the rest, I will
adventure to say something to this point. In former times, as we read, <span class="bibcite">Acts
xxiii.</span>, the Sadducees denied that there were any such spirits, devils, or
angels. So did Galen the physician, the Peripatetics, even Aristotle
himself, as Pomponatius stoutly maintains, and Scaliger in some sort
grants. Though Dandinus the Jesuit, <span class="cite">com. in lib. 2. de anima</span>, stiffly
denies it; <span lang="la">substantiae separatae</span> and intelligences, are the same which
Christians call angels, and Platonists devils, for they name all the
spirits, <span lang="la">daemones</span>, be they good or bad angels, as Julius Pollux
<span class="cite">Onomasticon, lib. 1. cap. 1.</span> observes. Epicures and atheists are of the
same mind in general, because they never saw them. Plato, Plotinus,
Porphyrius, Jamblichus, Proclus, insisting in the steps of Trismegistus,
Pythagoras and Socrates, make no doubt of it: nor Stoics, but that there
are such spirits, though much erring from the truth. Concerning the first
beginning of them, the <a href="#note1120">[1120]</a>Talmudists say that Adam had a wife called
Lilis, before he married Eve, and of her he begat nothing but devils. The
Turks' <a href="#note1121">[1121]</a>Alcoran is altogether as absurd and ridiculous in this point:
but the Scripture informs us Christians, how Lucifer, the chief of them,
with his associates, <a href="#note1122">[1122]</a>fell from heaven for his pride and ambition;
created of God, placed in heaven, and sometimes an angel of light, now cast
down into the lower aerial sublunary parts, or into hell, <q>and delivered
into chains of darkness (<span class="bibcite">2 Pet. ii. 4.</span>) to be kept unto damnation.</q>

<p><i>Nature of Devils.</i>] There is a foolish opinion which some hold, that they
are the souls of men departed, good and more noble were deified, the baser
grovelled on the ground, or in the lower parts, and were devils, the which
with Tertullian, Porphyrius the philosopher, M. Tyrius, <span class="cite">ser. 27</span> maintains.
<q>These spirits,</q> he <a href="#note1123">[1123]</a>saith, <q>which we call angels and devils, are
nought but souls of men departed, which either through love and pity of
their friends yet living, help and assist them, or else persecute their
enemies, whom they hated,</q> as Dido threatened to persecute Aeneas:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Omnibus umbra locis adero: dabis improbe poenas.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">My angry ghost arising from the deep,</div>
<div class="line">Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep;</div>
<div class="line">At least my shade thy punishment shall know,</div>
<div class="line">And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.</div>
</div>
They are (as others suppose) appointed by those higher powers to keep men
from their nativity, and to protect or punish them as they see cause: and
are called <span lang="la">boni et mali Genii</span> by the Romans. Heroes, lares, if good,
lemures or larvae if bad, by the stoics, governors of countries, men,
cities, saith <a href="#note1124">[1124]</a>Apuleius, <span lang="la">Deos appellant qui ex hominum numero juste
ac prudenter vitae curriculo gubernato, pro numine, postea ab hominibus
praediti fanis et ceremoniis vulgo admittuntur, ut in Aegypto Osyris</span>, &amp;c.
<span lang="la">Praestites</span>, Capella calls them, <q>which protected particular men as well as
princes,</q> Socrates had his <span lang="la">Daemonium Saturninum et ignium</span>, which of all
spirits is best, <span lang="la">ad sublimes cogitationes animum erigentem</span>, as the
Platonists supposed; Plotinus his, and we Christians our assisting angel,
as Andreas Victorellus, a copious writer of this subject, Lodovicus de
La-Cerda, the Jesuit, in his voluminous tract <span class="cite">de Angelo Custode</span>,
Zanchius, and some divines think. But this absurd tenet of Tyreus, Proclus
confutes at large in his book <span class="cite">de Anima et daemone</span>.

<p>Psellus <a href="#note1125">[1125]</a>, a Christian, and sometimes tutor (saith Cuspinian) to
Michael Parapinatius, Emperor of Greece, a great observer of the nature of
devils, holds they are corporeal <a href="#note1126">[1126]</a>, and have <q>aerial bodies, that they
are mortal, live and die,</q> (which Martianus Capella likewise maintains, but
our Christian philosophers explode) <q>that they <a href="#note1127">[1127]</a>are nourished and
have excrements, they feel pain if they be hurt</q> (which Cardan confirms, and
Scaliger justly laughs him to scorn for; <span lang="la">Si pascantur aere, cur non
pugnant ob puriorem aera</span>? &amp;c.) <q>or stroken:</q> and if their bodies be cut,
with admirable celerity they come together again. Austin, <span class="cite">in Gen. lib. iii.
lib. arbit.</span>, approves as much, <span lang="la">mutata casu corpora in deteriorem
qualitatem aeris spissioris</span>, so doth Hierome. <span class="cite">Comment. in epist. ad Ephes.
cap. 3</span>, Origen, Tertullian, Lactantius, and many ancient Fathers of the
Church: that in their fall their bodies were changed into a more aerial and
gross substance. Bodine, <span class="cite">lib. 4, Theatri Naturae</span> and David Crusius,
<span class="cite">Hermeticae Philosophiae, lib. 1. cap. 4</span>, by several arguments proves angels
and spirits to be corporeal: <span lang="la">quicquid continetur in loco corporeum est; At
spiritus continetur in loco, ergo. <a href="#note1128">[1128]</a>Si spiritus sunt quanti, erunt
corporei: At sunt quanti, ergo. sunt finiti, ergo. quanti</span>, &amp;c. Bodine
<a href="#note1129">[1129]</a>goes farther yet, and will have these, <span lang="la">Animae separatae genii</span>,
spirits, angels, devils, and so likewise souls of men departed, if
corporeal (which he most eagerly contends) to be of some shape, and that
absolutely round, like Sun and Moon, because that is the most perfect form,
<span lang="la">quae nihil habet asperitatis, nihil angulis incisum, nihil anfractibus
involutem, nihil eminens, sed inter corpora perfecta est perfectissimum</span>;
<a href="#note1130">[1130]</a>therefore all spirits are corporeal he concludes, and in their
proper shapes round. That they can assume other aerial bodies, all manner
of shapes at their pleasures, appear in what likeness they will themselves,
that they are most swift in motion, can pass many miles in an instant, and
so likewise <a href="#note1131">[1131]</a>transform bodies of others into what shape they please,
and with admirable celerity remove them from place to place; (as the Angel
did Habakkuk to Daniel, and as Philip the deacon was carried away by the
Spirit, when he had baptised the eunuch; so did Pythagoras and Apollonius
remove themselves and others, with many such feats) that they can represent
castles in the air, palaces, armies, spectrums, prodigies, and such strange
objects to mortal men's eyes, <a href="#note1132">[1132]</a>cause smells, savours, &amp;c., deceive
all the senses; most writers of this subject credibly believe; and that
they can foretell future events, and do many strange miracles. Juno's image
spake to Camillus, and Fortune's statue to the Roman matrons, with many
such. Zanchius, Bodine, Spondanus, and others, are of opinion that they
cause a true metamorphosis, as Nebuchadnezzar was really translated into a
beast, Lot's wife into a pillar of salt; Ulysses' companions into hogs and
dogs, by Circe's charms; turn themselves and others, as they do witches
into cats, dogs, hares, crows, &amp;c. Strozzius Cicogna hath many examples,
<span class="cite">lib. iii. omnif. mag. cap. 4 and 5</span>, which he there confutes, as Austin
likewise doth, <span class="cite">de civ. Dei lib. xviii</span>. That they can be seen when and in
what shape, and to whom they will, saith Psellus, <span lang="la">Tametsi nil tale
viderim, nec optem videre</span>, though he himself never saw them nor desired
it; and use sometimes carnal copulation (as elsewhere I shall <a href="#note1133">[1133]</a>prove
more at large) with women and men. Many will not believe they can be seen,
and if any man shall say, swear, and stiffly maintain, though he be
discreet and wise, judicious and learned, that he hath seen them, they
account him a timorous fool, a melancholy dizzard, a weak fellow, a dreamer,
a sick or a mad man, they contemn him, laugh him to scorn, and yet Marcus
of his credit told Psellus that he had often seen them. And Leo Suavius, a
Frenchman, <span class="cite">c. 8, in Commentar. l. 1. Paracelsi de vita longa</span>, out of some
Platonists, will have the air to be as full of them as snow falling in the
skies, and that they may be seen, and withal sets down the means how men
may see them; <span lang="la">Si irreverberatus oculis sole splendente versus caelum
continuaverint obtutus</span>, &amp;c., <a href="#note1134">[1134]</a>and saith moreover he tried it,
<span lang="la">praemissorum feci experimentum</span>, and it was true, that the Platonists said.
Paracelsus confesseth that he saw them divers times, and conferred with
them, and so doth Alexander ab <a href="#note1135">[1135]</a>Alexandro, <q>that he so found it by
experience, when as before he doubted of it.</q> Many deny it, saith Lavater,
<span class="cite">de spectris, part 1. c. 2</span>, and <span class="cite">part 2. c. 11</span>, <q>because they never saw them
themselves;</q> but as he reports at large all over his book, especially <span class="cite">c.
19. part 1</span>, they are often seen and heard, and familiarly converse with
men, as Lod. Vives assureth us, innumerable records, histories, and
testimonies evince in all ages, times, places, and <a href="#note1136">[1136]</a>all travellers
besides; in the West Indies and our northern climes, <span lang="la">Nihil familiarius
quam in agris et urbibus spiritus videre, audire qui vetent, jubeant</span>, &amp;c.
Hieronymus <span class="cite">vita Pauli</span>, Basil <span class="cite">ser. 40</span>, Nicephorus, Eusebius, Socrates,
Sozomenus, <a href="#note1137">[1137]</a>Jacobus Boissardus in his tract <span class="cite">de spirituum
apparitionibus</span>, Petrus Loyerus <span class="cite">l. de spectris</span>, Wierus <span class="cite">l. 1.</span> have infinite
variety of such examples of apparitions of spirits, for him to read that
farther doubts, to his ample satisfaction. One alone I will briefly insert.
A nobleman in Germany was sent ambassador to the King of Sweden (for his
name, the time, and such circumstances, I refer you to Boissardus, mine
<a href="#note1138">[1138]</a>Author). After he had done his business, he sailed to Livonia, on
set purpose to see those familiar spirits, which are there said to be
conversant with men, and do their drudgery works. Amongst other matters,
one of them told him where his wife was, in what room, in what clothes,
what doing, and brought him a ring from her, which at his return, <span lang="la">non sine
omnium admiratione</span>, he found to be true; and so believed that ever after,
which before he doubted of. Cardan, <span class="cite">l. 19. de subtil</span>, relates of his
father, Facius Cardan, that after the accustomed solemnities, <i>An.</i> 1491, 13
August, he conjured up seven devils, in Greek apparel, about forty years of
age, some ruddy of complexion, and some pale, as he thought; he asked them
many questions, and they made ready answer, that they were aerial devils,
that they lived and died as men did, save that they were far longer lived
(700 or 800 <a href="#note1139">[1139]</a>years); they did as much excel men in dignity as we do
juments, and were as far excelled again of those that were above them; our
<a href="#note1140">[1140]</a>governors and keepers they are moreover, which <a href="#note1141">[1141]</a>Plato in
Critias delivered of old, and subordinate to one another, <span lang="la">Ut enim homo
homini sic daemon daemoni dominatur</span>, they rule themselves as well as us, and
the spirits of the meaner sort had commonly such offices, as we make
horse-keepers, neat-herds, and the basest of us, overseers of our cattle;
and that we can no more apprehend their natures and functions, than a horse
a man's. They knew all things, but might not reveal them to men; and ruled
and domineered over us, as we do over our horses; the best kings amongst
us, and the most generous spirits, were not comparable to the basest of
them. Sometimes they did instruct men, and communicate their skill, reward
and cherish, and sometimes, again, terrify and punish, to keep them in awe,
as they thought fit, <span lang="la">Nihil magis cupientes</span> (saith Lysius, <span class="cite">Phis.
Stoicorum</span>) <span lang="la">quam adorationem hominum</span>. <a href="#note1142">[1142]</a>The same Author, Cardan, in
his <span class="cite">Hyperchen</span>, out of the doctrine of Stoics, will have some of these <span lang="la">genii</span>
(for so he calls them) to be <a href="#note1143">[1143]</a>desirous of men's company, very affable
and familiar with them, as dogs are; others, again, to abhor as serpents,
and care not for them. The same belike Tritemius calls <span lang="la">Ignios et
sublunares, qui nunquam demergunt ad inferiora, aut vix ullum habent in
terris commercium</span>: <a href="#note1144">[1144]</a><q>Generally they far excel men in worth, as a man
the meanest worm; though some of them are inferior to those of their own
rank in worth, as the blackguard in a prince's court, and to men again, as
some degenerate, base, rational creatures, are excelled of brute beasts.</q>

<p>That they are mortal, besides these testimonies of Cardan, Martianus, &amp;c.,
many other divines and philosophers hold, <span lang="la">post prolixum tempus moriuntur
omnes</span>; The <a href="#note1145">[1145]</a>Platonists, and some Rabbins, Porphyrius and Plutarch,
as appears by that relation of Thamus: <a href="#note1146">[1146]</a><q>The great God Pan is dead;
Apollo Pythius ceased; and so the rest.</q> St. Hierome, in the life of Paul
the Hermit, tells a story how one of them appeared to St. Anthony in the
wilderness, and told him as much. <a href="#note1147">[1147]</a>Paracelsus of our late writers
stiffly maintains that they are mortal, live and die as other creatures do.
Zozimus, <span class="cite">l. 2</span>, farther adds, that religion and policy dies and alters with
them. The <a href="#note1148">[1148]</a>Gentiles' gods, he saith, were expelled by Constantine,
and together with them. <span lang="la">Imperii Romani majestas, et fortuna interiit, et
profligata est</span>; The fortune and majesty of the Roman Empire decayed and
vanished, as that heathen in <a href="#note1149">[1149]</a>Minutius formerly bragged, when the
Jews were overcome by the Romans, the Jew's God was likewise captivated by
that of Rome; and Rabsakeh to the Israelites, no God should deliver them
out of the hands of the Assyrians. But these paradoxes of their power,
corporeity, mortality, taking of shapes, transposing bodies, and carnal
copulations, are sufficiently confuted by Zanch. <span class="cite">c. 10, l. 4.</span> Pererius in
his comment, and Tostatus questions on the 6th of Gen. Th. Aquin., St.
Austin, Wierus, Th. Erastus, Delrio, <span class="cite">tom. 2, l. 2, quaest. 29</span>; Sebastian
Michaelis, <span class="cite">c. 2, de spiritibus</span>, D. Reinolds <span class="cite">Lect. 47.</span> They may deceive the
eyes of men, yet not take true bodies, or make a real metamorphosis; but as
Cicogna proves at large, they are <a href="#note1150">[1150]</a><span lang="la">Illusoriae, et praestigiatrices
transformationes</span>, <span class="cite">omnif. mag. lib. 4. cap. 4</span>, mere illusions and
cozenings, like that tale of <span lang="la">Pasetis obulus</span> in Suidas, or that of
Autolicus, Mercury's son, that dwelt in Parnassus, who got so much treasure
by cozenage and stealth. His father Mercury, because he could leave him no
wealth, taught him many fine tricks to get means, <a href="#note1151">[1151]</a>for he could drive
away men's cattle, and if any pursued him, turn them into what shapes he
would, and so did mightily enrich himself, <span lang="la">hoc astu maximam praedam est
adsecutus</span>. This, no doubt, is as true as the rest; yet thus much in
general. Thomas, Durand, and others, grant that they have understanding far
beyond men, can probably conjecture and <a href="#note1152">[1152]</a>foretell many things; they
can cause and cure most diseases, deceive our senses; they have excellent
skill in all Arts and Sciences; and that the most illiterate devil is
<span lang="la">Quovis homine scientior</span> (more knowing than any man), as <a href="#note1153">[1153]</a>Cicogna
maintains out of others. They know the virtues of herbs, plants, stones,
minerals, &amp;c.; of all creatures, birds, beasts, the four elements, stars,
planets, can aptly apply and make use of them as they see good; perceiving
the causes of all meteors, and the like: <span lang="la">Dant se coloribus</span> (as <a href="#note1154">[1154]</a>
Austin hath it) <span lang="la">accommodant se figuris, adhaerent sonis, subjiciunt se
odoribus, infundunt se saporibus, omnes sensus etiam ipsam intelligentiam
daemones fallunt</span>, they deceive all our senses, even our understanding
itself at once. <a href="#note1155">[1155]</a>They can produce miraculous alterations in the air,
and most wonderful effects, conquer armies, give victories, help, further,
hurt, cross and alter human attempts and projects (<span lang="la">Dei permissu</span>) as they
see good themselves. <a href="#note1156">[1156]</a>When Charles the Great intended to make a
channel betwixt the Rhine and the Danube, look what his workmen did in the
day, these spirits flung down in the night, <span lang="la">Ut conatu Rex desisteret,
pervicere</span>. Such feats can they do. But that which Bodine, <span class="cite">l. 4, Theat.
nat.</span> thinks (following Tyrius belike, and the Platonists,) they can tell
the secrets of a man's heart, <span lang="la">aut cogitationes hominum</span>, is most false;
his reasons are weak, and sufficiently confuted by Zanch. <span class="cite">lib. 4, cap. 9.</span>
Hierom. <span class="cite">lib. 2, com. in Mat. ad cap. 15</span>, Athanasius <span class="cite">quaest. 27, ad Antiochum
Principem</span>, and others.

<p><i>Orders</i>.] As for those orders of good and bad devils, which the Platonists
hold, is altogether erroneous, and those Ethnics <span lang="la">boni et mali Genii</span>, are
to be exploded: these heathen writers agree not in this point among
themselves, as Dandinus notes, <span lang="la">An sint <a href="#note1157">[1157]</a>mali non conveniunt</span>, some
will have all spirits good or bad to us by a mistake, as if an Ox or Horse
could discourse, he would say the Butcher was his enemy because he killed
him, the grazier his friend because he fed him; a hunter preserves and yet
kills his game, and is hated nevertheless of his game; <span lang="la">nec piscatorem
piscis amare potest</span>, &amp;c. But Jamblichus, Psellus, Plutarch, and most
Platonists acknowledge bad, <span lang="la">et ab eorum maleficiis cavendum</span>, and we
should beware of their wickedness, for they are enemies of mankind, and
this Plato learned in Egypt, that they quarrelled with Jupiter, and were
driven by him down to hell. <a href="#note1158">[1158]</a>That which <a href="#note1159">[1159]</a>Apuleius, Xenophon,
and Plato contend of Socrates Daemonium, is most absurd: That which Plotinus
of his, that he had likewise <span lang="la">Deum pro Daemonio</span>; and that which Porphyry
concludes of them all in general, if they be neglected in their sacrifice
they are angry; nay more, as Cardan in his <span class="cite">Hipperchen</span> will, they feed on
men's souls, <span lang="la">Elementa sunt plantis elementum, animalibus plantae, hominibus
animalia, erunt et homines aliis, non autem diis, nimis enim remota est
eorum natura a nostra, quapropter daemonibus</span>: and so belike that we have so
many battles fought in all ages, countries, is to make them a feast, and
their sole delight: but to return to that I said before, if displeased they
fret and chafe, (for they feed belike on the souls of beasts, as we do on
their bodies) and send many plagues amongst us; but if pleased, then they
do much good; is as vain as the rest and confuted by Austin, <span class="cite">l. 9. c. 8. de
Civ. Dei</span>. Euseb. <span class="cite">l. 4. praepar. Evang. c. 6.</span> and others. Yet thus much I
find, that our schoolmen and other <a href="#note1160">[1160]</a>divines make nine kinds of bad
spirits, as Dionysius hath done of angels. In the first rank are those
false gods of the gentiles, which were adored heretofore in several idols,
and gave oracles at Delphos, and elsewhere; whose prince is Beelzebub. The
second rank is of liars and equivocators, as Apollo, Pythius, and the like.
The third are those vessels of anger, inventors of all mischief; as that
Theutus in Plato; Esay calls them <a href="#note1161">[1161]</a>vessels of fury; their prince is
Belial. The fourth are malicious revenging devils; and their prince is
Asmodaeus. The fifth kind are cozeners, such as belong to magicians and
witches; their prince is Satan. The sixth are those aerial devils that
<a href="#note1162">[1162]</a>corrupt the air and cause plagues, thunders, fires, &amp;c.; spoken of
in the Apocalypse, and Paul to the Ephesians names them the princes of the
air; Meresin is their prince. The seventh is a destroyer, captain of the
furies, causing wars, tumults, combustions, uproars, mentioned in the
Apocalypse; and called Abaddon. The eighth is that accusing or calumniating
devil, whom the Greeks call <span lang="gr">&Delta;&iota;&alpha;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, that drives men to despair.
The ninth are those tempters in several kinds, and their prince is Mammon.
Psellus makes six kinds, yet none above the Moon: Wierus in his
<span class="cite">Pseudo-monarchia Daemonis</span>, out of an old book, makes many more divisions and
subordinations, with their several names, numbers, offices, &amp;c., but Gazaeus
cited by <a href="#note1163">[1163]</a>Lipsius will have all places full of angels, spirits, and
devils, above and beneath the Moon,<a href="#note1164">[1164]</a>ethereal and aerial, which Austin
cites out of Varro <span class="cite">l. 7. de Civ. Dei, c. 6.</span> <q>The celestial devils above,
and aerial beneath,</q> or, as some will, gods above, Semi-dei or half gods
beneath, Lares, Heroes, Genii, which climb higher, if they lived well, as
the Stoics held; but grovel on the ground as they were baser in their
lives, nearer to the earth: and are Manes, Lemures, Lamiae, &amp;c. <a href="#note1165">[1165]</a>They
will have no place but all full of spirits, devils, or some other
inhabitants; <span lang="la">Plenum Caelum, aer, aqua terra, et omnia sub terra</span>, saith
<a href="#note1166">[1166]</a>Gazaeus; though Anthony Rusca in his book <span class="cite">de Inferno, lib. v. cap. 7.</span>
would confine them to the middle region, yet they will have them
everywhere. <q>Not so much as a hair-breadth empty in heaven, earth, or
waters, above or under the earth.</q> The air is not so full of flies in
summer, as it is at all times of invisible devils: this <a href="#note1167">[1167]</a>Paracelsus
stiffly maintains, and that they have every one their several chaos, others
will have infinite worlds, and each world his peculiar spirits, gods,
angels, and devils to govern and punish it.

<p><a href="#note1169">[1169]</a>Gregorius Tholsanus makes seven kinds of ethereal spirits or angels,
according to the number of the seven planets, Saturnine, Jovial, Martial,
of which Cardan discourseth <span class="cite">lib. 20. de subtil.</span> he calls them <span lang="la">substantias
primas, Olympicos daemones Tritemius, qui praesunt Zodiaco</span>, &amp;c., and will
have them to be good angels above, devils beneath the Moon, their several
names and offices he there sets down, and which Dionysius of Angels, will
have several spirits for several countries, men, offices, &amp;c., which live
about them, and as so many assisting powers cause their operations, will
have in a word, innumerable, as many of them as there be stars in the
skies. <a href="#note1170">[1170]</a>Marcilius Ficinus seems to second this opinion, out of Plato,
or from himself, I know not, (still ruling their inferiors, as they do
those under them again, all subordinate, and the nearest to the earth rule
us, whom we subdivide into good and bad angels, call gods or devils, as
they help or hurt us, and so adore, love or hate) but it is most likely
from Plato, for he relying wholly on Socrates, <span lang="la">quem mori potius quam
mentiri voluisse scribit</span>, whom he says would rather die than tell a
falsehood, out of Socrates' authority alone, made nine kinds of them: which
opinion belike Socrates took from Pythagoras, and he from Trismegistus, he
from Zoroastes, first God, second idea, 3. Intelligences, 4. Arch-Angels,
5. Angels, 6. Devils, 7. Heroes, 8. Principalities, 9. Princes: of which
some were absolutely good, as gods, some bad, some indifferent <span lang="la">inter deos
et homines</span>, as heroes and daemons, which ruled men, and were called genii,
or as <a href="#note1171">[1171]</a>Proclus and Jamblichus will, the middle betwixt God and men.
Principalities and princes, which commanded and swayed kings and countries;
and had several places in the spheres perhaps, for as every sphere is
higher, so hath it more excellent inhabitants: which belike is that
Galilaeus a Galileo and Kepler aims at in his nuncio Syderio, when he will
have <a href="#note1172">[1172]</a>Saturnine and Jovial inhabitants: and which Tycho Brahe doth in
some sort touch or insinuate in one of his epistles: but these things
<a href="#note1173">[1173]</a>Zanchius justly explodes, <span class="cite">cap. 3. lib. 4.</span> P. Martyr, <span class="cite">in 4. Sam. 28.</span>

<p>So that according to these men the number of ethereal spirits must needs
be infinite: for if that be true that some of our mathematicians say: if a
stone could fall from the starry heaven, or eighth sphere, and should pass
every hour an hundred miles, it would be 65 years, or more, before it would
come to ground, by reason of the great distance of heaven from earth, which
contains as some say 170 millions 800 miles, besides those other heavens,
whether they be crystalline or watery which Maginus adds, which
peradventure holds as much more, how many such spirits may it contain? And
yet for all this <a href="#note1174">[1174]</a>Thomas Albertus, and most hold that there be far
more angels than devils.

<p><i>Sublunary devils, and their kinds.</i>] But be they more or less, <span lang="la">Quod supra
nos nihil ad nos</span> (what is beyond our comprehension does not concern us).
Howsoever as Martianus foolishly supposeth, <span lang="la">Aetherii Daemones non curant
res humanas</span>, they care not for us, do not attend our actions, or look for
us, those ethereal spirits have other worlds to reign in belike or business
to follow. We are only now to speak in brief of these sublunary spirits or
devils: for the rest, our divines determine that the devil had no power
over stars, or heavens; <a href="#note1175">[1175]</a><span lang="la">Carminibus coelo possunt deducere lunam</span>,
&amp;C., (by their charms (verses) they can seduce the moon from the heavens).
Those are poetical fictions, and that they can <a href="#note1176">[1176]</a><span lang="la">sistere aquam
fluviis, et vertere sidera retro</span>, &amp;c., (stop rivers and turn the stars
backward in their courses) as Canadia in Horace, 'tis all false. <a href="#note1177">[1177]</a>
They are confined until the day of judgment to this sublunary world, and
can work no farther than the four elements, and as God permits them.
Wherefore of these sublunary devils, though others divide them otherwise
according to their several places and offices, Psellus makes six kinds,
fiery, aerial, terrestrial, watery, and subterranean devils, besides those
fairies, satyrs, nymphs, &amp;c.

<p>Fiery spirits or devils are such as commonly work by blazing stars,
fire-drakes, or <span lang="la">ignes fatui</span>; which lead men often <span lang="la">in flumina aut
praecipitia</span>, saith Bodine, <span class="cite">lib. 2. Theat. Naturae, fol. 221.</span> <span lang="la">Quos inquit
arcere si volunt viatores, clara voce Deum appellare aut pronam facie
terram contingente adorare oportet, et hoc amuletum majoribus nostris
acceptum ferre debemus</span>, &amp;c., (whom if travellers wish to keep off they
must pronounce the name of God with a clear voice, or adore him with their
faces in contact with the ground, &amp;c.); likewise they counterfeit suns and
moons, stars oftentimes, and sit on ship masts: <span lang="la">In navigiorum summitatibus
visuntur</span>; and are called <span lang="la">dioscuri</span>, as Eusebius <span class="cite">l. contra Philosophos, c.
xlviii</span>. informeth us, out of the authority of Zenophanes; or little clouds,
<span lang="la">ad motum nescio quem volantes</span>; which never appear, saith Cardan, but they
signify some mischief or other to come unto men, though some again will
have them to pretend good, and victory to that side they come towards in
sea fights, St. Elmo's fires they commonly call them, and they do likely
appear after a sea storm; Radzivilius, the Polonian duke, calls this
apparition, <span lang="la">Sancti Germani sidus</span>; and saith moreover that he saw the same
after in a storm, as he was sailing, 1582, from Alexandria to Rhodes.
<a href="#note1178">[1178]</a>Our stories are full of such apparitions in all kinds. Some think
they keep their residence in that Hecla, a mountain in Iceland, Aetna in
Sicily, Lipari, Vesuvius, &amp;c. These devils were worshipped heretofore by
that superstitious Pyromanteia <a href="#note1179">[1179]</a>and the like.

<p>Aerial spirits or devils, are such as keep quarter most part in the <a href="#note1180">[1180]</a>
air, cause many tempests, thunder, and lightnings, tear oaks, fire
steeples, houses, strike men and beasts, make it rain stones, as in Livy's
time, wool, frogs, &amp;c. Counterfeit armies in the air, strange noises,
swords, &amp;c., as at Vienna before the coming of the Turks, and many times in
Rome, as Scheretzius <span class="cite">l. de spect. c. 1. part 1.</span> Lavater <span class="cite">de spect. part. 1.
c. 17.</span> Julius Obsequens, an old Roman, in his book of prodigies, <i>ab urb.
cond.</i> 505. <a href="#note1181">[1181]</a>Machiavel hath illustrated by many examples, and
Josephus, in his book <span class="cite">de bello Judaico</span>, before the destruction of
Jerusalem. All which Guil. Postellus, in his first book, <span class="cite">c. 7, de orbis
concordia</span>, useth as an effectual argument (as indeed it is) to persuade
them that will not believe there be spirits or devils. They cause
whirlwinds on a sudden, and tempestuous storms; which though our
meteorologists generally refer to natural causes, yet I am of Bodine's
mind, <span class="cite">Theat. Nat. l. 2.</span> they are more often caused by those aerial devils,
in their several quarters; for <span lang="la">Tempestatibus se ingerunt</span>, saith <a href="#note1182">[1182]</a>
Rich. Argentine; as when a desperate man makes away with himself, which by
hanging or drowning they frequently do, as Kommanus observes, <span class="cite">de mirac.
mort. part. 7, c. 76.</span> <span lang="la">tripudium agentes</span>, dancing and rejoicing at the
death of a sinner. These can corrupt the air, and cause plagues, sickness,
storms, shipwrecks, fires, inundations. At Mons Draconis in Italy, there is
a most memorable example in <a href="#note1183">[1183]</a>Jovianus Pontanus: and nothing so
familiar (if we may believe those relations of Saxo Grammaticus, Olaus
Magnus, Damianus A. Goes) as for witches and sorcerers, in Lapland,
Lithuania, and all over Scandia, to sell winds to mariners, and cause
tempests, which Marcus Paulus the Venetian relates likewise of the Tartars.
These kind of devils are much <a href="#note1184">[1184]</a>delighted in sacrifices (saith
Porphyry), held all the world in awe, and had several names, idols,
sacrifices, in Rome, Greece, Egypt, and at this day tyrannise over, and
deceive those Ethnics and Indians, being adored and worshipped for <a href="#note1185">[1185]</a>
gods. For the Gentiles' gods were devils (as <a href="#note1186">[1186]</a>Trismegistus confesseth
in his Asclepius), and he himself could make them come to their images by
magic spells: and are now as much <q>respected by our papists</q> (saith <a href="#note1187">[1187]</a>
Pictorius) <q>under the name of saints.</q> These are they which Cardan thinks
desire so much carnal copulation with witches (Incubi and Succubi),
transform bodies, and are so very cold, if they be touched; and that serve
magicians. His father had one of them (as he is not ashamed to relate),
<a href="#note1188">[1188]</a>an aerial devil, bound to him for twenty and eight years. As
Agrippa's dog had a devil tied to his collar; some think that Paracelsus
(or else Erastus belies him) had one confined to his sword pummel; others
wear them in rings, &amp;c. Jannes and Jambres did many things of old by their
help; Simon Magus, Cinops, Apollonius Tianeus, Jamblichus, and Tritemius of
late, that showed Maximilian the emperor his wife, after she was dead; <span lang="la">Et
verrucam in collo ejus</span> (saith <a href="#note1189">[1189]</a>Godolman) so much as the wart in her
neck. Delrio, <span class="cite">lib. 2.</span> hath divers examples of their feats: Cicogna, <span class="cite">lib.
3. cap. 3.</span> and Wierus in his book <span class="cite">de praestig. daemonum</span>. Boissardus <span class="cite">de
magis et veneficis</span>.

<p>Water-devils are those Naiads or water nymphs which have been heretofore
conversant about waters and rivers. The water (as Paracelsus thinks) is
their chaos, wherein they live; some call them fairies, and say that
Habundia is their queen; these cause inundations, many times shipwrecks,
and deceive men divers ways, as Succuba, or otherwise, appearing most part
(saith Tritemius) in women's shapes. <a href="#note1190">[1190]</a>Paracelsus hath several stories
of them that have lived and been married to mortal men, and so continued
for certain years with them, and after, upon some dislike, have forsaken
them. Such a one as Aegeria, with whom Numa was so familiar, Diana, Ceres,
&amp;c. <a href="#note1191">[1191]</a>Olaus Magnus hath a long narration of one Hotherus, a king of
Sweden, that having lost his company, as he was hunting one day, met with
these water nymphs or fairies, and was feasted by them; and Hector
Boethius, or Macbeth, and Banquo, two Scottish lords, that as they were
wandering in the woods, had their fortunes told them by three strange
women. To these, heretofore, they did use to sacrifice, by that
<span lang="gr">&#x1F51;&delta;&rho;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#x1F73;&iota;&alpha;</span>, or divination by waters.

<p>Terrestrial devils are those <a href="#note1192">[1192]</a>Lares, genii, fauns, satyrs, <a href="#note1193">[1193]</a>
wood-nymphs, foliots, fairies, Robin Goodfellows, trulli, &amp;c., which as
they are most conversant with men, so they do them most harm. Some think it
was they alone that kept the heathen people in awe of old, and had so many
idols and temples erected to them. Of this range was Dagon amongst the
Philistines, Bel amongst the Babylonians, Astartes amongst the Sidonians,
Baal amongst the Samaritans, Isis and Osiris amongst the Egyptians, &amp;c.;
some put our <a href="#note1194">[1194]</a>fairies into this rank, which have been in former times
adored with much superstition, with sweeping their houses, and setting of a
pail of clean water, good victuals, and the like, and then they should not
be pinched, but find money in their shoes, and be fortunate in their
enterprises. These are they that dance on heaths and greens, as <a href="#note1195">[1195]</a>
Lavater thinks with Tritemius, and as <a href="#note1196">[1196]</a>Olaus Magnus adds, leave that
green circle, which we commonly find in plain fields, which others hold to
proceed from a meteor falling, or some accidental rankness of the ground,
so nature sports herself; they are sometimes seen by old women and
children. Hierom. Pauli, in his description of the city of Bercino in
Spain, relates how they have been familiarly seen near that town, about
fountains and hills; <span lang="la">Nonnunquam</span> (saith Tritemius) <span lang="la">in sua latibula
montium simpliciores homines ducant, stupenda mirantibus ostentes miracula,
nolarum sonitus, spectacula</span>, &amp;c. <a href="#note1197">[1197]</a>Giraldus Cambrensis gives
instance in a monk of Wales that was so deluded. <a href="#note1198">[1198]</a>Paracelsus reckons
up many places in Germany, where they do usually walk in little coats, some
two feet long. A bigger kind there is of them called with us hobgoblins,
and Robin Goodfellows, that would in those superstitious times grind corn
for a mess of milk, cut wood, or do any manner of drudgery work. They would
mend old irons in those Aeolian isles of Lipari, in former ages, and have
been often seen and heard. <a href="#note1199">[1199]</a>Tholosanus calls them <span lang="la">trullos</span> and
Getulos, and saith, that in his days they were common in many places of
France. Dithmarus Bleskenius, in his description of Iceland, reports for a
certainty, that almost in every family they have yet some such familiar
spirits; and Felix Malleolus, in his book <span class="cite">de crudel. daemon.</span> affirms as
much, that these trolli or telchines are very common in Norway, <q>and <a href="#note1200">[1200]</a>
seen to do drudgery work;</q> to draw water, saith Wierus, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 22</span>,
dress meat, or any such thing. Another sort of these there are, which
frequent forlorn <a href="#note1201">[1201]</a>houses, which the Italians call foliots, most part
innoxious, <a href="#note1202">[1202]</a>Cardan holds; <q>They will make strange noises in the night,
howl sometimes pitifully, and then laugh again, cause great flame and
sudden lights, fling stones, rattle chains, shave men, open doors and shut
them, fling down platters, stools, chests, sometimes appear in the likeness
of hares, crows, black dogs,</q> &amp;c. of which read <a href="#note1203">[1203]</a>Pet Thyraeus the
Jesuit, in his Tract, <span class="cite">de locis infestis, part. 1. et cap. 4</span>, who will
have them to be devils or the souls of damned men that seek revenge, or
else souls out of purgatory that seek ease; for such examples peruse <a href="#note1204">[1204]</a>
Sigismundus Scheretzius, <span class="cite">lib. de spectris, part 1. c. 1.</span> which he saith
he took out of Luther most part; there be many instances. <a href="#note1205">[1205]</a>Plinius
Secundus remembers such a house at Athens, which Athenodorus the
philosopher hired, which no man durst inhabit for fear of devils. Austin,
<span class="cite">de Civ. Dei. lib. 22, cap. 1.</span> relates as much of Hesperius the
Tribune's house, at Zubeda, near their city of Hippos, vexed with evil
spirits, to his great hindrance, <span lang="la">Cum afflictione animalium et servorum
suorum</span>. Many such instances are to be read in Niderius Formicar, <span class="cite">lib. 5.
cap. xii. 3.</span> &amp;c. Whether I may call these Zim and Ochim, which Isaiah,
<span class="bibcite">cap. xiii. 21.</span> speaks of, I make a doubt. See more of these in the said
Scheretz. <span class="cite">lib. 1. de spect. cap. 4.</span> he is full of examples. These kind
of devils many times appear to men, and affright them out of their wits,
sometimes walking at <a href="#note1206">[1206]</a>noonday, sometimes at nights, counterfeiting
dead men's ghosts, as that of Caligula, which (saith Suetonius) was seen to
walk in Lavinia's garden, where his body was buried, spirits haunted, and
the house where he died, <a href="#note1207">[1207]</a><span lang="la">Nulla nox sine terrore transacta, donec
incendio consumpta</span>; every night this happened, there was no quietness,
till the house was burned. About Hecla, in Iceland, ghosts commonly walk,
<span lang="la">animas mortuorum simulantes</span>, saith Joh. Anan, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de nat. daem.</span>
Olaus. <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 2.</span> Natal Tallopid. <span class="cite">lib. de apparit. spir.</span>
Kornmannus <span class="cite">de mirac. mort. part. 1. cap. 44.</span> such sights are frequently
seen <span class="cite">circa sepulchra et monasteria</span>, saith Lavat. <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 19.</span> in
monasteries and about churchyards, <span lang="la">loca paludinosa, ampla aedificia,
solitaria, et caede hominum notata</span>, &amp;c. (marshes, great buildings, solitary
places, or remarkable as the scene of some murder.) Thyreus adds, <span lang="la">ubi
gravius peccatum est commissum, impii, pauperum oppressores et nequiter
insignes habitant</span> (where some very heinous crime was committed, there the
impious and infamous generally dwell). These spirits often foretell men's
deaths by several signs, as knocking, groanings, &amp;c. <a href="#note1208">[1208]</a>though Rich.
Argentine, <span class="cite">c. 18. de praestigiis daemonum</span>, will ascribe these predictions
to good angels, out of the authority of Ficinus and others; <span lang="la">prodigia in
obitu principum saepius contingunt</span>, &amp;c. (prodigies frequently occur at the
deaths of illustrious men), as in the Lateran church in <a href="#note1209">[1209]</a>Rome, the
popes' deaths are foretold by Sylvester's tomb. Near Rupes Nova in Finland,
in the kingdom of Sweden, there is a lake, in which, before the governor of
the castle dies, a spectrum, in the habit of Arion with his harp, appears,
and makes excellent music, like those blocks in Cheshire, which (they say)
presage death to the master of the family; or that <a href="#note1210">[1210]</a>oak in Lanthadran
park in Cornwall, which foreshows as much. Many families in Europe are so
put in mind of their last by such predictions, and many men are forewarned
(if we may believe Paracelsus) by familiar spirits in divers shapes, as
cocks, crows, owls, which often hover about sick men's chambers, <span lang="la">vel quia
morientium foeditatem sentiunt</span>, as <a href="#note1211">[1211]</a>Baracellus conjectures, <span lang="la">et ideo
super tectum infirmorum crocitant</span>, because they smell a corse; or for that
(as <a href="#note1212">[1212]</a>Bernardinus de Bustis thinketh) God permits the devil to appear
in the form of crows, and such like creatures, to scare such as live
wickedly here on earth. A little before Tully's death (saith Plutarch) the
crows made a mighty noise about him, <span lang="la">tumultuose perstrepentes</span>, they
pulled the pillow from under his head. Rob. Gaguinus, <span class="cite">hist. Franc. lib.
8</span>, telleth such another wonderful story at the death of Johannes de
Monteforti, a French lord, <i>anno</i> 1345, <span lang="la">tanta corvorum multitudo aedibus
morientis insedit, quantam esse in Gallia nemo judicasset</span> (a multitude of
crows alighted on the house of the dying man, such as no one imagined
existed in France). Such prodigies are very frequent in authors. See more
of these in the said Lavater, Thyreus <span class="cite">de locis infestis, part 3, cap.
58.</span> Pictorius, Delrio, Cicogna, <span class="cite">lib. 3, cap. 9.</span> Necromancers take upon
them to raise and lay them at their pleasures: and so likewise, those which
Mizaldus calls <span lang="la">ambulones</span>, that walk about midnight on great heaths and
desert places, which (saith <a href="#note1213">[1213]</a>Lavater) <q>draw men out of the way, and
lead them all night a byway, or quite bar them of their way;</q> these have
several names in several places; we commonly call them Pucks. In the
deserts of Lop, in Asia, such illusions of walking spirits are often
perceived, as you may read in M. Paulus the Venetian his travels; if one
lose his company by chance, these devils will call him by his name, and
counterfeit voices of his companions to seduce him. Hieronym. Pauli, in his
book of the hills of Spain, relates of a great <a href="#note1214">[1214]</a>mount in Cantabria,
where such spectrums are to be seen; Lavater and Cicogna have variety of
examples of spirits and walking devils in this kind. Sometimes they sit by
the highway side, to give men falls, and make their horses stumble and
start as they ride (if you will believe the relation of that holy man
Ketellus in <a href="#note1215">[1215]</a>Nubrigensis), that had an especial grace to see devils,
<span lang="la">Gratiam divinitus collatam</span>, and talk with them, <span lang="la">Et impavidus cum
spiritibus sermonem miscere</span>, without offence, and if a man curse or spur
his horse for stumbling, they do heartily rejoice at it; with many such
pretty feats.

<p>Subterranean devils are as common as the rest, and do as much harm. Olaus
Magnus, <span class="cite">lib. 6, cap. 19</span>, make six kinds of them; some bigger, some
less. These (saith <a href="#note1216">[1216]</a>Munster) are commonly seen about mines of metals,
and are some of them noxious; some again do no harm. The metal-men in many
places account it good luck, a sign of treasure and rich ore when they see
them. Georgius Agricola, in his book <span class="cite">de subterraneis animantibus, cap.
37</span>, reckons two more notable kinds of them, which he calls <a href="#note1217">[1217]</a><span lang="la">getuli</span>
and <span lang="la">cobali</span>, both <q>are clothed after the manner of metal-men, and will many
times imitate their works.</q> Their office, as Pictorius and Paracelsus
think, is to keep treasure in the earth, that it be not all at once
revealed; and besides, <a href="#note1218">[1218]</a>Cicogna avers that they are the frequent
causes of those horrible earthquakes <q>which often swallow up, not only
houses, but whole islands and cities;</q> in his third book, <span class="cite">cap. 11</span>, he
gives many instances.

<p>The last are conversant about the centre of the earth to torture the souls
of damned men to the day of judgment; their egress and regress some suppose
to be about Etna, Lipari, Mons Hecla in Iceland, Vesuvius, Terra del
Fuego, &amp;c., because many shrieks and fearful cries are continually heard
thereabouts, and familiar apparitions of dead men, ghosts and goblins.

<p><i>Their Offices, Operations, Study</i>.] Thus the devil reigns, and in a
thousand several shapes, <q>as a roaring lion still seeks whom he may
devour,</q> 1 Pet. v., by sea, land, air, as yet unconfined, though <a href="#note1219">[1219]</a>
some will have his proper place the air; all that space between us and the
moon for them that transgressed least, and hell for the wickedest of them,
<span lang="la">Hic velut in carcere ad finem mundi, tunc in locum funestiorum trudendi</span>,
as Austin holds <span class="cite">de Civit. Dei, c. 22, lib. 14, cap. 3 et 23</span>; but be
where he will, he rageth while he may to comfort himself, as <a href="#note1220">[1220]</a>
Lactantius thinks, with other men's falls, he labours all he can to bring
them into the same pit of perdition with him. For <a href="#note1221">[1221]</a><q>men's miseries,
calamities, and ruins are the devil's banqueting dishes.</q> By many
temptations and several engines, he seeks to captivate our souls. The Lord
of Lies, saith <a href="#note1222">[1222]</a>Austin, <q>as he was deceived himself, he seeks to
deceive others,</q> the ringleader to all naughtiness, as he did by Eve and
Cain, Sodom and Gomorrah, so would he do by all the world. Sometimes he
tempts by covetousness, drunkenness, pleasure, pride, &amp;c., errs, dejects,
saves, kills, protects, and rides some men, as they do their horses. He
studies our overthrow, and generally seeks our destruction; and although he
pretend many times human good, and vindicate himself for a god by curing of
several diseases, <span lang="la">aegris sanitatem, et caecis luminis usum restituendo</span>,
as Austin declares, <span class="cite">lib. 10, de civit Dei, cap. 6</span>, as Apollo,
Aesculapius, Isis, of old have done; divert plagues, assist them in wars,
pretend their happiness, yet <span lang="la">nihil his impurius, scelestius, nihil humano
generi infestius</span>, nothing so impure, nothing so pernicious, as may well
appear by their tyrannical and bloody sacrifices of men to Saturn and
Moloch, which are still in use among those barbarous Indians, their several
deceits and cozenings to keep men in obedience, their false oracles,
sacrifices, their superstitious impositions of fasts, penury, &amp;c. Heresies,
superstitious observations of meats, times, &amp;c., by which they <a href="#note1223">[1223]</a>
crucify the souls of mortal men, as shall be showed in our Treatise of
Religious Melancholy. <span lang="la">Modico adhuc tempore sinitur malignari</span>, as <a href="#note1224">[1224]</a>
Bernard expresseth it, by God's permission he rageth a while, hereafter to
be confined to hell and darkness, <q>which is prepared for him and his
angels,</q> <span class="bibcite">Mat. xxv</span>.

<p>How far their power doth extend it is hard to determine; what the ancients
held of their effects, force and operations, I will briefly show you: Plato
in Critias, and after him his followers, gave out that these spirits or
devils, <q>were men's governors and keepers, our lords and masters, as we are
of our cattle.</q> <a href="#note1225">[1225]</a><q>They govern provinces and kingdoms by oracles,
auguries,</q> dreams, rewards and punishments, prophecies, inspirations,
sacrifices, and religious superstitions, varied in as many forms as there
be diversity of spirits; they send wars, plagues, peace, sickness, health,
dearth, plenty, <a href="#note1226">[1226]</a><span lang="la">Adstantes hic jam nobis, spectantes, et
arbitrantes</span>, &amp;c. as appears by those histories of Thucydides, Livius,
Dionysius Halicarnassus, with many others that are full of their wonderful
stratagems, and were therefore by those Roman and Greek commonwealths
adored and worshipped for gods with prayers and sacrifices, &amp;c. <a href="#note1227">[1227]</a>In a
word, <span lang="la">Nihil magis quaerunt quam metum et admirationem hominum</span>; <a href="#note1228">[1228]</a>and
as another hath it, <span lang="la">Dici non potest, quam impotenti ardore in homines
dominium, et Divinos cultus maligni spiritus affectent</span>. <a href="#note1229">[1229]</a>Tritemius
in his book <span class="cite">de septem secundis</span>, assigns names to such angels as are
governors of particular provinces, by what authority I know not, and gives
them several jurisdictions. Asclepiades a Grecian, Rabbi Achiba the Jew,
Abraham Avenezra, and Rabbi Azariel, Arabians, (as I find them cited by
<a href="#note1230">[1230]</a>Cicogna) farther add, that they are not our governors only, <span lang="la">Sed ex
eorum concordia et discordia, boni et mali affectus promanant</span>, but as they
agree, so do we and our princes, or disagree; stand or fall. Juno was a
bitter enemy to Troy, Apollo a good friend, Jupiter indifferent, <span lang="la">Aequa
Venus Teucris, Pallas iniqua fuit</span>; some are for us still, some against us,
<span lang="la">Premente Deo, fert Deus alter opem</span>. Religion, policy, public and private
quarrels, wars are procured by them, and they are <a href="#note1231">[1231]</a>delighted perhaps
to see men fight, as men are with cocks, bulls and dogs, bears, &amp;c.,
plagues, dearths depend on them, our <span lang="la">bene</span> and <span lang="la">male esse</span>, and almost all
our other peculiar actions, (for as Anthony Rusea contends, <span class="cite">lib. 5,
cap. 18</span>, every man hath a good and a bad angel attending on him in
particular, all his life long, which Jamblichus calls <span lang="la">daemonem</span>,)
preferments, losses, weddings, deaths, rewards and punishments, and as
<a href="#note1232">[1232]</a>Proclus will, all offices whatsoever, <span lang="la">alii genetricem, alii
opificem potestatem habent</span>, &amp;c. and several names they give them according
to their offices, as Lares, Indegites, Praestites, &amp;c. When the Arcades in
that battle at Cheronae, which was fought against King Philip for the
liberty of Greece, had deceitfully carried themselves, long after, in the
very same place, <span lang="la">Diis Graeciae, ultoribus</span> (saith mine author) they were
miserably slain by Metellus the Roman: so likewise, in smaller matters,
they will have things fall out, as these <span lang="la">boni</span> and <span lang="la">mali genii</span> favour or
dislike us: <span lang="la">Saturni non conveniunt Jovialibus</span>, &amp;c. He that is Saturninus
shall never likely be preferred. <a href="#note1233">[1233]</a>That base fellows are often
advanced, undeserving Gnathoes, and vicious parasites, whereas discreet,
wise, virtuous and worthy men are neglected and unrewarded; they refer to
those domineering spirits, or subordinate Genii; as they are inclined, or
favour men, so they thrive, are ruled and overcome; for as <a href="#note1234">[1234]</a>Libanius
supposeth in our ordinary conflicts and contentions, <span lang="la">Genius Genio cedit et
obtemperat</span>, one genius yields and is overcome by another. All particular
events almost they refer to these private spirits; and (as Paracelsus adds)
they direct, teach, inspire, and instruct men. Never was any man
extraordinary famous in any art, action, or great commander, that had not
<span lang="la">familiarem daemonem</span> to inform him, as Numa, Socrates, and many such, as
Cardan illustrates, <span class="cite">cap. 128</span>, <span lang="la">Arcanis prudentiae civilis</span>, <a href="#note1235">[1235]</a>
<span lang="la">Speciali siquidem gratia, se a Deo donari asserunt magi, a Geniis
caelestibus instrui, ab iis doceri</span>. But these are most erroneous paradoxes,
<span lang="la">ineptae et fabulosae nugae</span>, rejected by our divines and Christian churches.
'Tis true they have, by God's permission, power over us, and we find by
experience, that they can <a href="#note1236">[1236]</a>hurt not our fields only, cattle, goods,
but our bodies and minds. At Hammel in Saxony, <i>An.</i> 1484. 20 <i>Junii</i>, the
devil, in likeness of a pied piper, carried away 130 children that were
never after seen. Many times men are <a href="#note1237">[1237]</a>affrighted out of their wits,
carried away quite, as Scheretzius illustrates, <span class="cite">lib. 1, c. iv.</span>, and
severally molested by his means, Plotinus the Platonist, <span class="cite">lib. 14,
advers. Gnos.</span> laughs them to scorn, that hold the devil or spirits can
cause any such diseases. Many think he can work upon the body, but not upon
the mind. But experience pronounceth otherwise, that he can work both upon
body and mind. Tertullian is of this opinion, <span class="cite">c. 22.</span> <a href="#note1238">[1238]</a><q>That he can
cause both sickness and health,</q> and that secretly. <a href="#note1239">[1239]</a>Taurellus adds
<q>by clancular poisons he can infect the bodies, and hinder the operations
of the bowels, though we perceive it not, closely creeping into them,</q>
saith <a href="#note1240">[1240]</a>Lipsius, and so crucify our souls: <span lang="la">Et nociva melancholia
furiosos efficit</span>. For being a spiritual body, he struggles with our
spirits, saith Rogers, and suggests (according to <a href="#note1241">[1241]</a>Cardan, <span lang="la">verba
sine voce, species sine visu</span>, envy, lust, anger, &amp;c.) as he sees men
inclined.

<p>The manner how he performs it, Biarmannus in his Oration against Bodine,
sufficiently declares. <a href="#note1242">[1242]</a><q>He begins first with the phantasy, and moves
that so strongly, that no reason is able to resist.</q> Now the phantasy he
moves by mediation of humours; although many physicians are of opinion,
that the devil can alter the mind, and produce this disease of himself.
<span lang="la">Quibusdam medicorum visum</span>, saith <a href="#note1243">[1243]</a>Avicenna, <span lang="la">quod Melancholia
contingat a daemonio</span>. Of the same mind is Psellus and Rhasis the Arab.
<span class="cite">lib. 1. Tract. 9. Cont</span>. <a href="#note1244">[1244]</a><q>That this disease proceeds especially
from the devil, and from him alone.</q> Arculanus, <span class="cite">cap. 6. in 9. Rhasis</span>,
Aelianus Montaltus, in his <span class="cite">9. cap</span>. Daniel Sennertus, <span class="cite">lib. 1. part. 2.
cap. 11.</span> confirm as much, that the devil can cause this disease; by reason
many times that the parties affected prophesy, speak strange language, but
<span lang="la">non sine interventu humoris</span>, not without the humour, as he interprets
himself; no more doth Avicenna, <span lang="la">si contingat a daemonio, sufficit nobis ut
convertat complexionem ad choleram nigram, et sit causa ejus propinqua
cholera nigra</span>; the immediate cause is choler adust, which <a href="#note1245">[1245]</a>
Pomponatius likewise labours to make good: Galgerandus of Mantua, a famous
physician, so cured a demoniacal woman in his time, that spake all
languages, by purging black choler, and thereupon belike this humour of
melancholy is called <span lang="la">balneum diaboli</span>, the devil's bath; the devil spying
his opportunity of such humours drives them many times to despair, fury,
rage, &amp;c., mingling himself among these humours. This is that which
Tertullian avers, <span lang="la">Corporibus infligunt acerbos casus, animaeque repentinos,
membra distorquent, occulte repentes</span>, &amp;c. and which Lemnius goes about to
prove, <span lang="la">Immiscent se mali Genii pravis humoribus, atque atrae, bili</span>, &amp;c.
And <a href="#note1246">[1246]</a>Jason Pratensis, <q>that the devil, being a slender
incomprehensible spirit, can easily insinuate and wind himself into human
bodies, and cunningly couched in our bowels vitiate our healths, terrify
our souls with fearful dreams, and shake our minds with furies.</q> And in
another place, <q>These unclean spirits settled in our bodies, and now mixed
with our melancholy humours, do triumph as it were, and sport themselves as
in another heaven.</q> Thus he argues, and that they go in and out of our
bodies, as bees do in a hive, and so provoke and tempt us as they perceive
our temperature inclined of itself, and most apt to be deluded. <a href="#note1247">[1247]</a>
Agrippa and <a href="#note1248">[1248]</a>Lavater are persuaded, that this humour invites the
devil to it, wheresoever it is in extremity, and of all other, melancholy
persons are most subject to diabolical temptations and illusions, and most
apt to entertain them, and the Devil best able to work upon them. But
whether by obsession, or possession, or otherwise, I will not determine;
'tis a difficult question. Delrio the Jesuit, <span class="cite">Tom. 3. lib. 6.</span> Springer
and his colleague, <span class="cite">mall. malef</span>. Pet. Thyreus the Jesuit, <span class="cite">lib. de
daemoniacis, de locis infestis, de Terrificationibus nocturnis</span>, Hieronymus
Mengus <span class="cite">Flagel. daem</span>. and others of that rank of pontifical writers, it
seems, by their exorcisms and conjurations approve of it, having forged
many stories to that purpose. A nun did eat a lettuce <a href="#note1249">[1249]</a>without grace,
or signing it with the sign of the cross, and was instantly possessed.
Durand. <span class="cite">lib. 6. Rationall. c. 86. numb. 8.</span> relates that he saw a
wench possessed in Bononia with two devils, by eating an unhallowed
pomegranate, as she did afterwards confess, when she was cured by
exorcisms. And therefore our Papists do sign themselves so often with the
sign of the cross, <span lang="la">Ne daemon ingredi ausit</span>, and exorcise all manner of
meats, as being unclean or accursed otherwise, as Bellarmine defends. Many
such stories I find amongst pontifical writers, to prove their assertions,
let them free their own credits; some few I will recite in this kind out of
most approved physicians. Cornelius Gemma, <span class="cite">lib. 2. de nat. mirac. c. 4.</span>
relates of a young maid, called Katherine Gualter, a cooper's daughter,
<i>an.</i> 1571. that had such strange passions and convulsions, three men could
not sometimes hold her; she purged a live eel, which he saw, a foot and a
half long, and touched it himself; but the eel afterwards vanished; she
vomited some twenty-four pounds of fulsome stuff of all colours, twice a
day for fourteen days; and after that she voided great balls of hair,
pieces of wood, pigeon's dung, parchment, goose dung, coals; and after them
two pounds of pure blood, and then again coals and stones, or which some
had inscriptions bigger than a walnut, some of them pieces of glass, brass,
&amp;c. besides paroxysms of laughing, weeping and ecstasies, &amp;c. <span lang="la">Et hoc
(inquit) cum horore vidi</span>, this I saw with horror. They could do no good on
her by physic, but left her to the clergy. Marcellus Donatus, <span class="cite">lib. 2.
c. 1. de med. mirab.</span> hath such another story of a country fellow, that
had four knives in his belly, <span lang="la">Instar serrae dentatos</span>, indented like a saw,
every one a span long, and a wreath of hair like a globe, with much baggage
of like sort, wonderful to behold: how it should come into his guts, he
concludes, <span lang="la">Certe non alio quam daemonis astutia et dolo</span>, (could assuredly
only have been through the artifice of the devil). Langius, <span class="cite">Epist. med.
lib. 1. Epist. 38.</span> hath many relations to this effect, and so hath
Christophorus a Vega: Wierus, Skenkius, Scribanius, all agree that they are
done by the subtlety and illusion of the devil. If you shall ask a reason
of this, 'tis to exercise our patience; for as <a href="#note1250">[1250]</a>Tertullian holds,
<span lang="la">Virtus non est virtus, nisi comparem habet aliquem, in quo superando vim
suam ostendat</span> 'tis to try us and our faith, 'tis for our offences, and for
the punishment of our sins, by God's permission they do it, <span lang="la">Carnifices
vindictae justae Dei</span>, as <a href="#note1251">[1251]</a>Tolosanus styles them, Executioners of his
will; or rather as David, <span class="bibcite">Ps. 78. ver. 49</span>. <q>He cast upon them the
fierceness of his anger, indignation, wrath, and vexation, by sending out
of evil angels:</q> so did he afflict Job, Saul, the Lunatics and demoniacal
persons whom Christ cured, <span class="bibcite">Mat. iv. 8. Luke iv. 11. Luke xiii. Mark ix.
Tobit. viii. 3</span>. &amp;c. This, I say, happeneth for a punishment of sin, for
their want of faith, incredulity, weakness, distrust, &amp;c.

<p>You have heard what the devil can do of himself, now you shall hear what he
can perform by his instruments, who are many times worse (if it be
possible) than he himself, and to satisfy their revenge and lust cause more
mischief, <span lang="la">Multa enim mala non egisset daemon, nisi provocatus a sagis</span>, as
<a href="#note1252">[1252]</a>Erastus thinks; much harm had never been done, had he not been
provoked by witches to it. He had not appeared in Samuel's shape, if the
Witch of Endor had let him alone; or represented those serpents in
Pharaoh's presence, had not the magicians urged him unto it; <span lang="la">Nec morbos
vel hominibus, vel brutis infligeret</span> (Erastus maintains) <span lang="la">si sagae
quiescerent</span>; men and cattle might go free, if the witches would let him
alone. Many deny witches at all, or if there be any they can do no harm; of
this opinion is Wierus, <span class="cite">lib. 3. cap. 53. de praestig. daem</span>. Austin
Lerchemer a Dutch writer, Biarmanus, Ewichius, Euwaldus, our countryman
Scot; with him in Horace,

<div class="line">Of magic terrors, visionary dreams,</div>
<div class="line">Portentous wonders, witching imps of Hell,</div>

</div>
They laugh at all such stories; but on the contrary are most lawyers,
divines, physicians, philosophers, Austin, Hemingius, Danaeus, Chytraeus,

Camerarius, &amp;c. The parties by whom the devil deals, may be reduced to
these two, such as command him in show at least, as conjurors, and
magicians, whose detestable and horrid mysteries are contained in their
book called <a href="#note1254">[1254]</a>Arbatell; <span lang="la">daemonis enim advocati praesto sunt, seque
exorcismis et conjurationibus quasi cogi patiuntur, ut miserum magorum
genus, in impietate detineant</span>. Or such as are commanded, as witches, that
deal <span lang="la">ex parte implicite</span>, or <span lang="la">explicite</span>, as the <a href="#note1255">[1255]</a>king hath well
defined; many subdivisions there are, and many several species of
sorcerers, witches, enchanters, charmers, &amp;c. They have been tolerated
heretofore some of them; and magic hath been publicly professed in former
times, in <a href="#note1256">[1256]</a>Salamanca, <a href="#note1257">[1257]</a>Krakow, and other places, though after
censured by several <a href="#note1258">[1258]</a>Universities, and now generally contradicted,
though practised by some still, maintained and excused, <span lang="la">Tanquam res
secreta quae non nisi viris magnis et peculiari beneficio de Coelo
instructis communicatur</span> (I use <a href="#note1259">[1259]</a>Boesartus his words) and so far
approved by some princes, <span lang="la">Ut nihil ausi aggredi in politicis, in sacris,
in consiliis, sine eorum arbitrio</span>; they consult still with them, and dare
indeed do nothing without their advice. Nero and Heliogabalus, Maxentius,
and Julianus Apostata, were never so much addicted to magic of old, as some
of our modern princes and popes themselves are nowadays. Erricus, King of
Sweden, had an <a href="#note1260">[1260]</a>enchanted cap, by virtue of which, and some magical
murmur or whispering terms, he could command spirits, trouble the air, and
make the wind stand which way he would, insomuch that when there was any
great wind or storm, the common people were wont to say, the king now had
on his conjuring cap. But such examples are infinite. That which they can
do, is as much almost as the devil himself, who is still ready to satisfy
their desires, to oblige them the more unto him. They can cause tempests,
storms, which is familiarly practised by witches in Norway, Iceland, as I
have proved. They can make friends enemies, and enemies friends by
philters; <a href="#note1261">[1261]</a><span lang="la">Turpes amores conciliare</span>, enforce love, tell any man
where his friends are, about what employed, though in the most remote
places; and if they will, <a href="#note1262">[1262]</a><q>bring their sweethearts to them by night,
upon a goat's back flying in the air.</q> Sigismund Scheretzius, <span class="cite">part. 1.
cap. 9. de spect.</span> reports confidently, that he conferred with sundry such,
that had been so carried many miles, and that he heard witches themselves
confess as much; hurt and infect men and beasts, vines, corn, cattle,
plants, make women abortive, not to conceive, <a href="#note1263">[1263]</a>barren, men and women
unapt and unable, married and unmarried, fifty several ways, saith Bodine,
<span class="cite">lib. 2. c. 2.</span> fly in the air, meet when and where they will, as Cicogna
proves, and Lavat. <span class="cite">de spec. part. 2. c. 17.</span> <q>steal young children out

which we call changelings,</q> saith <a href="#note1264">[1264]</a>Scheretzius, <span class="cite">part. 1. c. 6.</span>
make men victorious, fortunate, eloquent; and therefore in those ancient
monomachies and combats they were searched of old, <a href="#note1265">[1265]</a>they had no
magical charms; they can make <a href="#note1266">[1266]</a>stick frees, such as shall endure a
rapier's point, musket shot, and never be wounded: of which read more in
Boissardus, <span class="cite">cap. 6. de Magia</span>, the manner of the adjuration, and by whom
'tis made, where and how to be used <span lang="la">in expeditionibus bellicis, praeliis,
duellis</span>, &amp;c., with many peculiar instances and examples; they can walk in
fiery furnaces, make men feel no pain on the rack, <span lang="la">aut alias torturas
sentire</span>; they can stanch blood, <a href="#note1267">[1267]</a>represent dead men's shapes, alter
and turn themselves and others into several forms, at their pleasures.
<a href="#note1268">[1268]</a>Agaberta, a famous witch in Lapland, would do as much publicly to
all spectators, <span lang="la">Modo Pusilla, modo anus, modo procera ut quercus, modo
vacca, avis, coluber</span>, &amp;c. Now young, now old, high, low, like a cow, like
a bird, a snake, and what not? She could represent to others what forms
they most desired to see, show them friends absent, reveal secrets, <span lang="la">maxima
omnium admiratione</span>, &amp;c. And yet for all this subtlety of theirs, as
Lipsius well observes, <span class="cite">Physiolog. Stoicor. lib. 1. cap. 17.</span> neither
these magicians nor devils themselves can take away gold or letters out of
mine or Crassus' chest, <span lang="la">et Clientelis suis largiri</span>, for they are base,
poor, contemptible fellows most part; as <a href="#note1269">[1269]</a>Bodine notes, they can do
nothing <span lang="la">in Judicum decreta aut poenas, in regum concilia vel arcana, nihil
in rem nummariam aut thesauros</span>, they cannot give money to their clients,
alter judges' decrees, or councils of kings, these <span lang="la">minuti Genii</span> cannot do
it, <span lang="la">altiores Genii hoc sibi adservarunt</span>, the higher powers reserve these
things to themselves. Now and then peradventure there may be some more
famous magicians like Simon Magus, <a href="#note1270">[1270]</a>Apollonius Tyaneus, Pasetes,
Jamblichus, <a href="#note1271">[1271]</a>Odo de Stellis, that for a time can build castles in the
air, represent armies, &amp;c., as they are <a href="#note1272">[1272]</a>said to have done, command
wealth and treasure, feed thousands with all variety of meats upon a
sudden, protect themselves and their followers from all princes'
persecutions, by removing from place to place in an instant, reveal
secrets, future events, tell what is done in far countries, make them
appear that died long since, and do many such miracles, to the world's
terror, admiration and opinion of deity to themselves, yet the devil
forsakes them at last, they come to wicked ends, and <span lang="la">raro aut nunquam</span>
such impostors are to be found. The vulgar sort of them can work no such
feats. But to my purpose, they can, last of all, cure and cause most
diseases to such as they love or hate, and this of <a href="#note1273">[1273]</a>melancholy
amongst the rest. Paracelsus, <span class="cite">Tom. 4. de morbis amentium, Tract. 1.</span> in
express words affirms; <span lang="la">Multi fascinantur in melancholiam</span>, many are
bewitched into melancholy, out of his experience. The same saith Danaeus,
<span class="cite">lib. 3. de sortiariis</span>. <span lang="la">Vidi, inquit, qui Melancholicos morbos
gravissimos induxerunt</span>: I have seen those that have caused melancholy in
the most grievous manner, <a href="#note1274">[1274]</a>dried up women's paps, cured gout, palsy;
this and apoplexy, falling sickness, which no physic could help, <span lang="la">solu
tactu</span>, by touch alone. Ruland in his <span class="cite">3 Cent. Cura 91.</span> gives an instance of
one David Helde, a young man, who by eating cakes which a witch gave him,
<span lang="la">mox delirare coepit</span>, began to dote on a sudden, and was instantly mad: F.
H. D. in <a href="#note1275">[1275]</a>Hildesheim, consulted about a melancholy man, thought his
disease was partly magical, and partly natural, because he vomited pieces
of iron and lead, and spake such languages as he had never been taught; but
such examples are common in Scribanius, Hercules de Saxonia, and others.
The means by which they work are usually charms, images, as that in Hector
Boethius of King Duffe; characters stamped of sundry metals, and at such
and such constellations, knots, amulets, words, philters, &amp;c., which
generally make the parties affected, melancholy; as <a href="#note1276">[1276]</a>Monavius
discourseth at large in an epistle of his to Acolsius, giving instance in a
Bohemian baron that was so troubled by a philter taken. Not that there is
any power at all in those spells, charms, characters, and barbarous words;
but that the devil doth use such means to delude them. <span lang="la">Ut fideles inde
magos</span> (saith <a href="#note1277">[1277]</a>Libanius) <span lang="la">in officio retineat, tum in consortium

<h4><a name="1.2.1.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Stars a cause. Signs from Physiognomy, Metoposcopy, Chiromancy</i>.</h4>

<p>Natural causes are either primary and universal, or secondary and more
particular. Primary causes are the heavens, planets, stars, &amp;c., by their
influence (as our astrologers hold) producing this and such like effects. I
will not here stand to discuss <span lang="la">obiter</span>, whether stars be causes, or signs;
or to apologise for judical astrology. If either Sextus Empericus, Picus
Mirandula, Sextus ab Heminga, Pererius, Erastus, Chambers, &amp;c., have so far
prevailed with any man, that he will attribute no virtue at all to the
heavens, or to sun, or moon, more than he doth to their signs at an
innkeeper's post, or tradesman's shop, or generally condemn all such
astrological aphorisms approved by experience: I refer him to Bellantius,
Pirovanus, Marascallerus, Goclenius, Sir Christopher Heidon, &amp;c. If thou
shalt ask me what I think, I must answer, <span lang="la">nam et doctis hisce erroribus
versatus sum</span>, (for I am conversant with these learned errors,) they do
incline, but not compel; no necessity at all: <a href="#note1278">[1278]</a><span lang="la">agunt non cogunt</span>:
and so gently incline, that a wise man may resist them; <span lang="la">sapiens
dominabitur astris</span>: they rule us, but God rules them. All this (methinks)
<a href="#note1279">[1279]</a>Joh. de Indagine hath comprised in brief, <span lang="la">Quaeris a me quantum in
nobis operantur astra</span>? &amp;c. <q>Wilt thou know how far the stars work upon us?
I say they do but incline, and that so gently, that if we will be ruled by
reason, they have no power over us; but if we follow our own nature, and be
led by sense, they do as much in us as in brute beasts, and we are no
better.</q> So that, I hope, I may justly conclude with <a href="#note1280">[1280]</a>Cajetan,
<span lang="la">Coelum est vehiculum divinae virtutis</span>, &amp;c., that the heaven is God's
instrument, by mediation of which he governs and disposeth these elementary
bodies; or a great book, whose letters are the stars, (as one calls it,)
wherein are written many strange things for such as can read, <a href="#note1281">[1281]</a><q>or an
excellent harp, made by an eminent workman, on which, he that can but play,
will make most admirable music.</q> But to the purpose.

<p><a href="#note1282">[1282]</a>Paracelsus is of opinion, <q>that a physician without the knowledge of
stars can neither understand the cause or cure of any disease, either of
this or gout, not so much as toothache; except he see the peculiar geniture
and scheme of the party effected.</q> And for this proper malady, he will have
the principal and primary cause of it proceed from the heaven, ascribing
more to stars than humours, <a href="#note1283">[1283]</a><q>and that the constellation alone many
times produceth melancholy, all other causes set apart.</q> He gives instance
in lunatic persons, that are deprived of their wits by the moon's motion;
and in another place refers all to the ascendant, and will have the true
and chief cause of it to be sought from the stars. Neither is it his
opinion only, but of many Galenists and philosophers, though they do not so
peremptorily maintain as much. <q>This variety of melancholy symptoms
proceeds from the stars,</q> saith <a href="#note1284">[1284]</a>Melancthon: the most generous
melancholy, as that of Augustus, comes from the conjunction of Saturn and
Jupiter in Libra: the bad, as that of Catiline's, from the meeting of
Saturn and the moon in Scorpio. Jovianus Pontanus, in his tenth book, and
thirteenth chapter <span lang="la">de rebus coelestibus</span>, discourseth to this purpose at
large, <span lang="la">Ex atra bile varii generantur morbi</span>, &amp;c., <a href="#note1285">[1285]</a><q>many diseases
proceed from black choler, as it shall be hot or cold; and though it be
cold in its own nature, yet it is apt to be heated, as water may be made to
boil, and burn as bad as fire; or made cold as ice: and thence proceed such
variety of symptoms, some mad, some solitary, some laugh, some rage,</q> &amp;c.
The cause of all which intemperance he will have chiefly and primarily
proceed from the heavens, <a href="#note1286">[1286]</a><q>from the position of Mars, Saturn, and
Mercury.</q> His aphorisms be these, <a href="#note1287">[1287]</a><q>Mercury in any geniture, if he
shall be found in Virgo, or Pisces his opposite sign, and that in the
horoscope, irradiated by those quartile aspects of Saturn or Mars, the
child shall be mad or melancholy.</q> Again, <a href="#note1288">[1288]</a><q>He that shall have Saturn
and Mars, the one culminating, the other in the fourth house, when he shall
be born, shall be melancholy, of which he shall be cured in time, if
Mercury behold them. <a href="#note1289">[1289]</a>If the moon be in conjunction or opposition at
the birth time with the sun, Saturn or Mars, or in a quartile aspect with
them,</q> (<span lang="la">e malo coeli loco</span>, Leovitius adds,) <q>many diseases are signified,
especially the head and brain is like to be misaffected with pernicious
humours, to be melancholy, lunatic, or mad,</q> Cardan adds, <span lang="la">quarta luna
natos</span>, eclipses, earthquakes. Garcaeus and Leovitius will have the chief
judgment to be taken from the lord of the geniture, or where there is an
aspect between the moon and Mercury, and neither behold the horoscope, or
Saturn and Mars shall be lord of the present conjunction or opposition in
Sagittarius or Pisces, of the sun or moon, such persons are commonly
epileptic, dote, demoniacal, melancholy: but see more of these aphorisms
in the above-named Pontanus. Garcaeus, <span class="cite">cap. 23. de Jud. genitur. Schoner.
lib. 1. cap. 8</span>, which he hath gathered out of <a href="#note1290">[1290]</a>Ptolemy, Albubater,
and some other Arabians, Junctine, Ranzovius, Lindhout, Origen, &amp;c. But
these men you will reject peradventure, as astrologers, and therefore
partial judges; then hear the testimony of physicians, Galenists
themselves. <a href="#note1291">[1291]</a>Carto confesseth the influence of stars to have a great
hand to this peculiar disease, so doth Jason Pratensis, Lonicerius
<span class="cite">praefat. de Apoplexia</span>, Ficinus, Fernelius, &amp;c. <a href="#note1292">[1292]</a>P. Cnemander
acknowledgeth the stars an universal cause, the particular from parents,
and the use of the six non-natural things. Baptista Port. <span class="cite">mag. l. 1. c.
10, 12, 15</span>, will have them causes to every particular <span lang="la">individium</span>.
Instances and examples, to evince the truth of those aphorisms, are common
amongst those astrologian treatises. Cardan, in his thirty-seventh
geniture, gives instance in Matth. Bolognius. <span class="cite">Camerar. hor. natalit.
centur. 7. genit. 6. et 7.</span> of Daniel Gare, and others; but see Garcaeus,
<span class="cite">cap. 33.</span> Luc. Gauricus, <span class="cite">Tract. 6. de Azemenis</span>, &amp;c. The time of this
melancholy is, when the significators of any geniture are directed
according to art, as the hor: moon, hylech, &amp;c. to the hostile beams or
terms of &&#x2644; and &#x2642; especially, or any fixed star
of their nature, or if &&#x2644; by his revolution or transitus,
shall offend any of those radical promissors in the geniture.

<p>Other signs there are taken from physiognomy, metoposcopy, chiromancy,
which because Joh. de Indagine, and Rotman, the landgrave of Hesse his
mathematician, not long since in his Chiromancy; Baptista Porta, in his
celestial Physiognomy, have proved to hold great affinity with astrology,
to satisfy the curious, I am the more willing to insert.

<p>The general notions <a href="#note1293">[1293]</a>physiognomers give, be these; <q>black colour
argues natural melancholy; so doth leanness, hirsuteness, broad veins, much
hair on the brows,</q> saith <a href="#note1294">[1294]</a>Gratanarolus, <span class="cite">cap. 7</span>, and a little head,
out of Aristotle, high sanguine, red colour, shows head melancholy; they
that stutter and are bald, will be soonest melancholy, (as Avicenna
supposeth,) by reason of the dryness of their brains; but he that will know
more of the several signs of humour and wits out of physiognomy, let him
consult with old Adamantus and Polemus, that comment, or rather paraphrase
upon Aristotle's Physiognomy, Baptista Porta's four pleasant books, Michael
Scot <span class="cite">de secretis naturae</span>, John de Indagine, Montaltus, Antony Zara. <span class="cite">anat.
ingeniorum, sect. 1. memb. 13. et lib. 4.</span>

<p>Chiromancy hath these aphorisms to foretell melancholy, Tasneir. <span class="cite">lib. 5.
cap. 2</span>, who hath comprehended the sum of John de Indagine: Tricassus,
Corvinus, and others in his book, thus hath it; <a href="#note1295">[1295]</a><q>The Saturnine line
going from the rascetta through the hand, to Saturn's mount, and there
intersected by certain little lines, argues melancholy; so if the vital and
natural make an acute angle, Aphorism 100. The saturnine, hepatic, and
natural lines, making a gross triangle in the hand, argue as much;</q> which
Goclenius, <span class="cite">cap. 5. Chiros.</span> repeats verbatim out of him. In general they
conclude all, that if Saturn's mount be full of many small lines and
intersections, <a href="#note1296">[1296]</a><q>such men are most part melancholy, miserable and
full of disquietness, care and trouble, continually vexed with anxious and
bitter thoughts, always sorrowful, fearful, suspicious; they delight in
husbandry, buildings, pools, marshes, springs, woods, walks,</q> &amp;c. Thaddaeus
Haggesius, in his <span class="cite">Metoposcopia</span>, hath certain aphorisms derived from
Saturn's lines in the forehead, by which he collects a melancholy
disposition; and <a href="#note1297">[1297]</a>Baptista Porta makes observations from those other
parts of the body, as if a spot be over the spleen; <a href="#note1298">[1298]</a><q>or in the
nails; if it appear black, it signifieth much care, grief, contention, and
melancholy;</q> the reason he refers to the humours, and gives instance in
himself, that for seven years space he had such black spots in his nails,
and all that while was in perpetual lawsuits, controversies for his
inheritance, fear, loss of honour, banishment, grief, care, &amp;c. and when
his miseries ended, the black spots vanished. Cardan, in his book <span class="cite">de
libris propriis</span>, tells such a story of his own person, that a little
before his son's death, he had a black spot, which appeared in one of his
nails; and dilated itself as he came nearer to his end. But I am over
tedious in these toys, which howsoever, in some men's too severe censures,
they may be held absurd and ridiculous, I am the bolder to insert, as not
borrowed from circumforanean rogues and gipsies, but out of the writings of
worthy philosophers and physicians, yet living some of them, and religious
professors in famous universities, who are able to patronise that which
they have said, and vindicate themselves from all cavillers and ignorant
persons.

<h4><a name="1.2.1.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Old age a cause</i>.</h4>

<p>Secondary peculiar causes efficient, so called in respect of the other
precedent, are either <span lang="la">congenitae, internae, innatae</span>, as they term them,
inward, innate, inbred; or else outward and adventitious, which happen to
us after we are born: congenite or born with us, are either natural, as old
age, or <span lang="la">praeter naturam</span> (as <a href="#note1299">[1299]</a>Fernelius calls it) that
distemperature, which we have from our parent's seed, it being an
hereditary disease. The first of these, which is natural to all, and which
no man living can avoid, is <a href="#note1300">[1300]</a>old age, which being cold and dry, and
of the same quality as melancholy is, must needs cause it, by diminution of
spirits and substance, and increasing of adust humours; therefore <a href="#note1301">[1301]</a>
Melancthon avers out of Aristotle, as an undoubted truth, <span lang="la">Senes plerunque
delirasse in senecta</span>, that old men familiarly dote, <span lang="la">ob atram bilem</span>, for
black choler, which is then superabundant in them: and Rhasis, that Arabian
physician, in his <span class="cite">Cont. lib. 1. cap. 9</span>, calls it <a href="#note1302">[1302]</a><q>a necessary and
inseparable accident,</q> to all old and decrepit persons. After seventy years
(as the Psalmist saith) <a href="#note1303">[1303]</a><q>all is trouble and sorrow;</q> and common
experience confirms the truth of it in weak and old persons, especially
such as have lived in action all their lives, had great employment, much
business, much command, and many servants to oversee, and leave off <span lang="la">ex
abrupto</span>; as <a href="#note1304">[1304]</a>Charles the Fifth did to King Philip, resign up all on
a sudden; they are overcome with melancholy in an instant: or if they do
continue in such courses, they dote at last, (<span lang="la">senex bis puer</span>,) and are
not able to manage their estates through common infirmities incident in
their age; full of ache, sorrow and grief, children again, dizzards, they
carl many times as they sit, and talk to themselves, they are angry,
waspish, displeased with every thing, <q>suspicious of all, wayward,
covetous, hard</q> (saith Tully,) <q>self-willed, superstitious, self-conceited,
braggers and admirers of themselves,</q> as <a href="#note1305">[1305]</a>Balthazar Castilio hath
truly noted of them.<a href="#note1306">[1306]</a>This natural infirmity is most eminent in old
women, and such as are poor, solitary, live in most base esteem and
beggary, or such as are witches; insomuch that Wierus, Baptista Porta,
Ulricus Molitor, Edwicus, do refer all that witches are said to do, to
imagination alone, and this humour of melancholy. And whereas it is
controverted, whether they can bewitch cattle to death, ride in the air
upon a cowl-staff out of a chimney-top, transform themselves into cats,
dogs, &amp;c., translate bodies from place to place, meet in companies, and
dance, as they do, or have carnal copulation with the devil, they ascribe
all to this redundant melancholy, which domineers in them, to <a href="#note1307">[1307]</a>
somniferous potions, and natural causes, the devil's policy. <span lang="la">Non laedunt
omnino</span> (saith Wierus) <span lang="la">aut quid mirum faciunt</span>, (<span class="cite">de Lamiis, lib. 3.
cap. 36</span>), <span lang="la">ut putatur, solam vitiatam habent phantasiam</span>; they do no
such wonders at all, only their <a href="#note1308">[1308]</a>brains are crazed. <a href="#note1309">[1309]</a><q>They
think they are witches, and can do hurt, but do not.</q> But this opinion
Bodine, Erastus, Danaeus, Scribanius, Sebastian Michaelis, Campanella <span class="cite">de
Sensu rerum, lib. 4. cap. 9.</span> <a href="#note1310">[1310]</a>Dandinus the Jesuit, <span class="cite">lib. 2. de
Animae explode</span>; <a href="#note1311">[1311]</a>Cicogna confutes at large. That witches are
melancholy, they deny not, but not out of corrupt phantasy alone, so to
delude themselves and others, or to produce such effects.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.1.6"></a>SUBSECT. VI.&mdash;<i>Parents a cause by Propagation</i>.</h4>

<p>That other inward inbred cause of Melancholy is our temperature, in whole
or part, which we receive from our parents, which <a href="#note1312">[1312]</a>Fernelius calls
<span lang="la">Praeter naturam</span>, or unnatural, it being an hereditary disease; for as he
justifies <a href="#note1313">[1313]</a><span lang="la">Quale parentum maxime patris semen obtigerit, tales
evadunt similares spermaticaeque paries, quocunque etiam morbo Pater quum
generat tenetur, cum semine transfert, in Prolem</span>; such as the temperature
of the father is, such is the son's, and look what disease the father had
when he begot him, his son will have after him; <a href="#note1314">[1314]</a><q>and is as well
inheritor of his infirmities, as of his lands. And where the complexion and
constitution of the father is corrupt, there (<a href="#note1315">[1315]</a>saith Roger Bacon) the
complexion and constitution of the son must needs be corrupt, and so the
corruption is derived from the father to the son.</q> Now this doth not so
much appear in the composition of the body, according to that of
Hippocrates, <a href="#note1316">[1316]</a><q>in habit, proportion, scars, and other lineaments; but
in manners and conditions of the mind,</q>
<span lang="la">Et patrum in natos abeunt cum semine mores.</span>

<p>Seleucus had an anchor on his thigh, so had his posterity, as Trogus
records, <span class="cite">lib. 15.</span> Lepidus, in Pliny <span class="cite">l. 7. c. 17</span>, was purblind, so was his
son. That famous family of Aenobarbi were known of old, and so surnamed from
their red beards; the Austrian lip, and those Indian flat noses are
propagated, the Bavarian chin, and goggle eyes amongst the Jews, as <a href="#note1317">[1317]</a>
Buxtorfius observes; their voice, pace, gesture, looks, are likewise
derived with all the rest of their conditions and infirmities; such a
mother, such a daughter; their very <a href="#note1318">[1318]</a>affections Lemnius contends <q>to
follow their seed, and the malice and bad conditions of children are many
times wholly to be imputed to their parents;</q> I need not therefore make any
doubt of Melancholy, but that it is an hereditary disease. <a href="#note1319">[1319]</a>
Paracelsus in express words affirms it, <span class="cite">lib. de morb. amentium to. 4.
tr. 1</span>; so doth <a href="#note1320">[1320]</a>Crato in an Epistle of his to Monavius. So doth
Bruno Seidelius in his book <span class="cite">de morbo incurab.</span> Montaltus proves, <span class="cite">cap. 11</span>,
out of Hippocrates and Plutarch, that such hereditary dispositions are
frequent, <span lang="la">et hanc (inquit) fieri reor ob participatam melancholicam
intemperantiam</span> (speaking of a patient) I think he became so by
participation of Melancholy. Daniel Sennertus, <span class="cite">lib. 1. part 2. cap. 9</span>, will
have his melancholy constitution derived not only from the father to the
son, but to the whole family sometimes; <span lang="la">Quandoque totis familiis
hereditativam</span>, <a href="#note1321">[1321]</a>Forestus, in his medicinal observations, illustrates
this point, with an example of a merchant, his patient, that had this
infirmity by inheritance; so doth Rodericus a Fonseca, <span class="cite">tom. 1. consul. 69</span>,
by an instance of a young man that was so affected <span lang="la">ex matre melancholica</span>,
had a melancholy mother, <span lang="la">et victu melancholico</span>, and bad diet together.
Ludovicus Mercatus, a Spanish physician, in that excellent Tract which he
hath lately written of hereditary diseases, <span class="cite">tom. 2. oper. lib. 5</span>, reckons
up leprosy, as those <a href="#note1322">[1322]</a>Galbots in Gascony, hereditary lepers, pox,
stone, gout, epilepsy, &amp;c. Amongst the rest, this and madness after a set
time comes to many, which he calls a miraculous thing in nature, and sticks
for ever to them as an incurable habit. And that which is more to be
wondered at, it skips in some families the father, and goes to the son,
<a href="#note1323">[1323]</a><q>or takes every other, and sometimes every third in a lineal
descent, and doth not always produce the same, but some like, and a
symbolizing disease.</q> These secondary causes hence derived, are commonly so
powerful, that (as <a href="#note1324">[1324]</a>Wolfius holds) <span lang="la">saepe mutant decreta siderum</span>,
they do often alter the primary causes, and decrees of the heavens. For
these reasons, belike, the Church and commonwealth, human and Divine laws,
have conspired to avoid hereditary diseases, forbidding such marriages as
are any whit allied; and as Mercatus adviseth all families to take such,
<span lang="la">si fieri possit quae maxime distant natura</span>, and to make choice of those
that are most differing in complexion from them; if they love their own,
and respect the common good. And sure, I think, it hath been ordered by
God's especial providence, that in all ages there should be (as usually
there is) once in <a href="#note1325">[1325]</a>600 years, a transmigration of nations, to amend
and purify their blood, as we alter seed upon our land, and that there
should be as it were an inundation of those northern Goths and Vandals, and
many such like people which came out of that continent of Scandia and
Sarmatia (as some suppose) and overran, as a deluge, most part of Europe
and Africa, to alter for our good, our complexions, which were much defaced
with hereditary infirmities, which by our lust and intemperance we had
contracted. A sound generation of strong and able men were sent amongst us,
as those northern men usually are, innocuous, free from riot, and free from
diseases; to qualify and make us as those poor naked Indians are generally
at this day; and those about Brazil (as a late <a href="#note1326">[1326]</a>writer observes), in
the Isle of Maragnan, free from all hereditary diseases, or other
contagion, whereas without help of physic they live commonly 120 years or
more, as in the Orcades and many other places. Such are the common effects
of temperance and intemperance, but I will descend to particular, and show
by what means, and by whom especially, this infirmity is derived unto us.

<p><span lang="la">Filii ex senibus nati, raro sunt firmi temperamenti</span>, old men's children
are seldom of a good temperament, as Scoltzius supposeth, <span class="cite">consult. 177</span>, and
therefore most apt to this disease; and as <a href="#note1327">[1327]</a>Levinus Lemnius farther
adds, old men beget most part wayward, peevish, sad, melancholy sons, and
seldom merry. He that begets a child on a full stomach, will either have a
sick child, or a crazed son (as <a href="#note1328">[1328]</a>Cardan thinks), <span class="cite">contradict. med.
lib. 1. contradict. 18</span>, or if the parents be sick, or have any great
pain of the head, or megrim, headache, (Hieronymus Wolfius <a href="#note1329">[1329]</a>doth
instance in a child of Sebastian Castalio's); if a drunken man get a child,
it will never likely have a good brain, as Gellius argues, <span class="cite">lib. 12. cap. 1.</span>
<span lang="la">Ebrii gignunt Ebrios</span>, one drunkard begets another, saith <a href="#note1330">[1330]</a>Plutarch,
<span class="cite">symp. lib. 1. quest. 5</span>, whose sentence <a href="#note1331">[1331]</a>Lemnius approves, <span class="cite">l. 1.

Macrobius, <span class="cite">lib. 1.</span> Avicenna, <span class="cite">lib. 3. Fen. 21. Tract 1. cap. 8</span>, and
Aristotle himself, <span class="cite">sect. 2. prob. 4</span>, foolish, drunken, or hair-brain
women, most part bring forth children like unto themselves, <span lang="la">morosos et
languidos</span>, and so likewise he that lies with a menstruous woman.
<span lang="la">Intemperantia veneris, quam in nautis praesertim insectatur <a href="#note1332">[1332]</a>
Lemnius, qui uxores ineunt, nulla menstrui decursus ratione habita nec
observato interlunio, praecipua causa est, noxia, pernitiosa, concubitum
hunc exitialem ideo, et pestiferum vocat. <a href="#note1333">[1333]</a>Rodoricus a Castro
Lucitanus, detestantur ad unum omnes medici, tum et quarta luna concepti,
infelices plerumque et amentes, deliri, stolidi, morbosi, impuri,
invalidi, tetra lue sordidi minime vitales, omnibus bonis corporis atque
animi destituti: ad laborem nati, si seniores, inquit Eustathius, ut
Hercules, et alii. <a href="#note1334">[1334]</a>Judaei maxime insectantur foedum hunc, et
immundum apud Christianas Concubitum, ut illicitum abhorrent, et apud suos
prohibent; et quod Christiani toties leprosi, amentes, tot morbili,
impetigines, alphi, psorae, cutis et faciei decolorationes, tam multi morbi
epidemici, acerbi, et venenosi sint, in hunc immundum concubitum rejiciunt,
et crudeles in pignora vocant, qui quarta, luna profluente hac mensium
illuvie concubitum hunc non perhorrescunt. Damnavit olim divina Lex et
morte mulctavit hujusmodi homines, <span class="bibcite">Lev. 18, 20</span>, et inde nati, siqui
deformes aut mutili, pater dilapidatus, quod non contineret ab <a href="#note1335">[1335]</a>
immunda muliere. Gregorius Magnus, petenti Augustino nunquid apud
<a href="#note1336">[1336]</a>Britannos hujusmodi concubitum toleraret, severe prohibuit viris
suis tum misceri foeminas in consuetis suis menstruis</span>, &amp;c. I spare to
English this which I have said. Another cause some give, inordinate diet,
as if a man eat garlic, onions, fast overmuch, study too hard, be
over-sorrowful, dull, heavy, dejected in mind, perplexed in his thoughts,
fearful, &amp;c., <q>their children</q> (saith <a href="#note1337">[1337]</a>Cardan <span class="cite">subtil. lib. 18</span>) <q>will
be much subject to madness and melancholy; for if the spirits of the brain
be fuzzled, or misaffected by such means, at such a time, their children
will be fuzzled in the brain: they will be dull, heavy, timorous,
discontented all their lives.</q> Some are of opinion, and maintain that
paradox or problem, that wise men beget commonly fools; Suidas gives
instance in Aristarchus the Grammarian, <span lang="la">duos reliquit Filios Aristarchum
et Aristachorum, ambos stultos</span>; and which <a href="#note1338">[1338]</a>Erasmus urgeth in his
<span class="cite">Moria</span>, fools beget wise men. Card. <span class="cite">subt. l. 12</span>, gives this cause,
<span lang="la">Quoniam spiritus sapientum ob studium resolvuntur, et in cerebrum feruntur
a corde</span>: because their natural spirits are resolved by study, and turned
into animal; drawn from the heart, and those other parts to the brain.
Lemnius subscribes to that of Cardan, and assigns this reason, <span lang="la">Quod
persolvant debitum languide, et obscitanter, unde foetus a parentum
generositate desciscit</span>: they pay their debt (as Paul calls it) to their
wives remissly, by which means their children are weaklings, and many times
idiots and fools.

<p>Some other causes are given, which properly pertain, and do proceed from
the mother: if she be over-dull, heavy, angry, peevish, discontented, and
melancholy, not only at the time of conception, but even all the while she
carries the child in her womb (saith Fernelius, <span class="cite">path. l. 1, 11</span>) her son
will be so likewise affected, and worse, as <a href="#note1339">[1339]</a>Lemnius adds, <span class="cite">l. 4. c.
7</span>, if she grieve overmuch, be disquieted, or by any casualty be affrighted
and terrified by some fearful object, heard or seen, she endangers her
child, and spoils the temperature of it; for the strange imagination of a
woman works effectually upon her infant, that as Baptista Porta proves,
<span class="cite">Physiog. caelestis l. 5. c. 2</span>, she leaves a mark upon it, which is most
especially seen in such as prodigiously long for such and such meats, the
child will love those meats, saith Fernelius, and be addicted to like
humours: <a href="#note1340">[1340]</a><q>if a great-bellied woman see a hare, her child will often
have a harelip,</q> as we call it. Garcaeus, <span class="cite">de Judiciis geniturarum, cap.
33</span>, hath a memorable example of one Thomas Nickell, born in the city of
Brandeburg, 1551, <a href="#note1341">[1341]</a><q>that went reeling and staggering all the days of
his life, as if he would fall to the ground, because his mother being great
with child saw a drunken man reeling in the street.</q> Such another I find in
Martin Wenrichius, <span class="cite">com. de ortu monstrorum, c. 17</span>, I saw (saith he) at
Wittenberg, in Germany, a citizen that looked like a carcass; I asked him
the cause, he replied, <a href="#note1342">[1342]</a><q>His mother, when she bore him in her womb,
saw a carcass by chance, and was so sore affrighted with it, that <span lang="la">ex eo
foetus ei assimilatus</span>, from a ghastly impression the child was like it.</q>

<p>So many several ways are we plagued and punished for our father's defaults;
insomuch that as Fernelius truly saith, <a href="#note1343">[1343]</a><q>It is the greatest part of
our felicity to be well born, and it were happy for human kind, if only
such parents as are sound of body and mind should be suffered to marry.</q> An
husbandman will sow none but the best and choicest seed upon his land, he
will not rear a bull or a horse, except he be right shapen in all parts, or
permit him to cover a mare, except he be well assured of his breed; we make
choice of the best rams for our sheep, rear the neatest kine, and keep the
best dogs, <span lang="la">Quanto id diligentius in procreandis liberis observandum</span>? And
how careful then should we be in begetting of our children? In former times
some <a href="#note1344">[1344]</a>countries have been so chary in this behalf, so stern, that if
a child were crooked or deformed in body or mind, they made him away; so
did the Indians of old by the relation of Curtius, and many other
well-governed commonwealths, according to the discipline of those times.
Heretofore in Scotland, saith <a href="#note1345">[1345]</a>Hect. Boethius, <q>if any were visited
with the falling sickness, madness, gout, leprosy, or any such dangerous
disease, which was likely to be propagated from the father to the son, he
was instantly gelded; a woman kept from all company of men; and if by
chance having some such disease, she were found to be with child, she with
her brood were buried alive:</q> and this was done for the common good, lest
the whole nation should be injured or corrupted. A severe doom you will
say, and not to be used amongst Christians, yet more to be looked into than
it is. For now by our too much facility in this kind, in giving way for all
to marry that will, too much liberty and indulgence in tolerating all
sorts, there is a vast confusion of hereditary diseases, no family secure,
no man almost free from some grievous infirmity or other, when no choice is
had, but still the eldest must marry, as so many stallions of the race; or
if rich, be they fools or dizzards, lame or maimed, unable, intemperate,
dissolute, exhaust through riot, as he said, <a href="#note1346">[1346]</a><span lang="la">jura haereditario
sapere jubentur</span>; they must be wise and able by inheritance: it comes to
pass that our generation is corrupt, we have many weak persons, both in
body and mind, many feral diseases raging amongst us, crazed families,
<span lang="la">parentes, peremptores</span>; our fathers bad, and we are like to be worse.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.2.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Bad Diet a cause. Substance. Quality of Meats</i>.</h4>

<p>According to my proposed method, having opened hitherto these secondary
causes, which are inbred with us, I must now proceed to the outward and
adventitious, which happen unto us after we are born. And those are either
evident, remote, or inward, antecedent, and the nearest: continent causes
some call them. These outward, remote, precedent causes are subdivided
again into necessary and not necessary. Necessary (because we cannot avoid
them, but they will alter us, as they are used, or abused) are those six
non-natural things, so much spoken of amongst physicians, which are
principal causes of this disease. For almost in every consultation, whereas
they shall come to speak of the causes, the fault is found, and this most
part objected to the patient; <span lang="la">Peccavit circa res sex non naturales</span>: he
hath still offended in one of those six. Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 22</span>, consulted
about a melancholy Jew, gives that sentence, so did Frisemelica in the same
place; and in his 244 counsel, censuring a melancholy soldier, assigns that
reason of his malady, <a href="#note1347">[1347]</a><q>he offended in all those six non-natural
things, which were the outward causes, from which came those inward
obstructions;</q> and so in the rest.

<p>These six non-natural things are diet, retention and evacuation, which are
more material than the other because they make new matter, or else are
conversant in keeping or expelling of it. The other four are air, exercise,
sleeping, waking, and perturbations of the mind, which only alter the
matter. The first of these is diet, which consists in meat and drink, and
causeth melancholy, as it offends in substance, or accidents, that is,
quantity, quality, or the like. And well it may be called a material cause,
since that, as <a href="#note1348">[1348]</a>Fernelius holds, <q>it hath such a power in begetting
of diseases, and yields the matter and sustenance of them; for neither air,
nor perturbations, nor any of those other evident causes take place, or
work this effect, except the constitution of body, and preparation of
humours, do concur. That a man may say, this diet is the mother of
diseases, let the father be what he will, and from this alone, melancholy
and frequent other maladies arise.</q> Many physicians, I confess, have
written copious volumes of this one subject, of the nature and qualities of
all manner of meats; as namely, Galen, Isaac the Jew, Halyabbas, Avicenna,
Mesue, also four Arabians, Gordonius, Villanovanus, Wecker, Johannes
Bruerinus, <span lang="la">sitologia de Esculentis et Poculentis</span>, Michael Savanarola,
<span class="cite">Tract 2. c. 8</span>, Anthony Fumanellus, <span class="cite">lib. de regimine senum</span>, Curio in his
comment on Schola Salerna, Godefridus Steckius <span class="cite">arte med.</span>, Marcilius
Cognatus, Ficinus, Ranzovius, Fonseca, Lessius, Magninus, <span class="cite">regim.
sanitatis</span>, Frietagius, Hugo Fridevallius, &amp;c., besides many other in
<a href="#note1349">[1349]</a>English, and almost every peculiar physician, discourseth at large
of all peculiar meats in his chapter of melancholy: yet because these books
are not at hand to every man, I will briefly touch what kind of meats
engender this humour, through their several species, and which are to be
avoided. How they alter and change the matter, spirits first, and after
humours, by which we are preserved, and the constitution of our body,
Fernelius and others will show you. I hasten to the thing itself: and first
of such diet as offends in substance.

<p><i>Beef.</i>] Beef, a strong and hearty meat (cold in the first degree, dry in
the second, saith <span class="cite">Gal. l. 3. c. 1. de alim. fac.</span>) is condemned by him and
all succeeding Authors, to breed gross melancholy blood: good for such as
are sound, and of a strong constitution, for labouring men if ordered
aright, corned, young, of an ox (for all gelded meats in every species are
held best), or if old, <a href="#note1350">[1350]</a>such as have been tired out with labour, are
preferred. Aubanus and Sabellicus commend Portugal beef to be the most
savoury, best and easiest of digestion; we commend ours: but all is
rejected, and unfit for such as lead a resty life, any ways inclined to
melancholy, or dry of complexion: <span lang="la">Tales</span> (Galen thinks) <span lang="la">de facile
melancholicis aegritudinibus capiuntur</span>.

<p><i>Pork.</i>] Pork, of all meats, is most nutritive in his own nature, <a href="#note1351">[1351]</a>
but altogether unfit for such as live at ease, are any ways unsound of body
or mind: too moist, full of humours, and therefore <span lang="la">noxia delicatis</span>, saith
Savanarola, <span lang="la">ex earum usu ut dubitetur an febris quartana generetur</span>:
naught for queasy stomachs, insomuch that frequent use of it may breed a
quartan ague.

<p><i>Goat.</i>] Savanarola discommends goat's flesh, and so doth <a href="#note1352">[1352]</a>Bruerinus,
<span class="cite">l. 13. c. 19</span>, calling it a filthy beast, and rammish: and therefore
supposeth it will breed rank and filthy substance; yet kid, such as are
young and tender, Isaac accepts, Bruerinus and Galen, <span class="cite">l. 1. c. 1. de
alimentorum facultatibus</span>.

<p><i>Hart.</i>] Hart and red deer <a href="#note1353">[1353]</a>hath an evil name: it yields gross
nutriment: a strong and great grained meat, next unto a horse. Which
although some countries eat, as Tartars, and they of China; yet <a href="#note1354">[1354]</a>
Galen condemns. Young foals are as commonly eaten in Spain as red deer, and
to furnish their navies, about Malaga especially, often used; but such
meats ask long baking, or seething, to qualify them, and yet all will not
serve.

<p>Venison, Fallow Deer.] All venison is melancholy, and begets bad blood; a
pleasant meat: in great esteem with us (for we have more parks in England
than there are in all Europe besides) in our solemn feasts. 'Tis somewhat
better hunted than otherwise, and well prepared by cookery; but generally
bad, and seldom to be used.

<p><i>Hare.</i>] Hare, a black meat, melancholy, and hard of digestion, it breeds
incubus, often eaten, and causeth fearful dreams, so doth all venison,
and is condemned by a jury of physicians. Mizaldus and some others say,
that hare is a merry meat, and that it will make one fair, as Martial's
epigram testifies to Gellia; but this is <span lang="la">per accidens</span>, because of the
good sport it makes, merry company and good discourse that is commonly at
the eating of it, and not otherwise to be understood.

<p><i>Conies.</i>] <a href="#note1355">[1355]</a>Conies are of the nature of hares. Magninus compares them
to beef, pig, and goat, <span class="cite">Reg. sanit. part. 3. c. 17</span>; yet young rabbits by
all men are approved to be good.

<p>Generally, all such meats as are hard of digestion breed melancholy.
Areteus, <span class="cite">lib. 7. cap. 5</span>, reckons up heads and feet, <a href="#note1356">[1356]</a>bowels,
brains, entrails, marrow, fat, blood, skins, and those inward parts, as
heart, lungs, liver, spleen, &amp;c. They are rejected by Isaac, <span class="cite">lib. 2. part.
3</span>, Magninus, <span class="cite">part. 3. cap. 17</span>, Bruerinus, <span class="cite">lib. 12</span>, Savanarola, <span class="cite">Rub.
32. Tract. 2.</span>

<p><i>Milk.</i>] Milk, and all that comes of milk, as butter and cheese, curds,
&amp;c., increase melancholy (whey only excepted, which is most wholesome):
<a href="#note1357">[1357]</a>some except asses' milk. The rest, to such as are sound, is
nutritive and good, especially for young children, but because soon turned
to corruption, <a href="#note1358">[1358]</a>not good for those that have unclean stomachs, are
subject to headache, or have green wounds, stone, &amp;c. Of all cheeses, I
take that kind which we call Banbury cheese to be the best, <span lang="la">ex vetustis
pessimus</span>, the older, stronger, and harder, the worst, as Langius
discourseth in his Epistle to Melancthon, cited by Mizaldus, Isaac, <span class="cite">p. 5.
Gal. 3. de cibis boni succi</span>. &amp;c.

<p><i>Fowl.</i>] Amongst fowl, <a href="#note1359">[1359]</a>peacocks and pigeons, all fenny fowl are
forbidden, as ducks, geese, swans, herons, cranes, coots, didappers,
water-hens, with all those teals, curs, sheldrakes, and peckled fowls, that
come hither in winter out of Scandia, Muscovy, Greenland, Friesland, which
half the year are covered all over with snow, and frozen up. Though these
be fair in feathers, pleasant in taste, and have a good outside, like
hypocrites, white in plumes, and soft, their flesh is hard, black,
unwholesome, dangerous, melancholy meat; <span lang="la">Gravant et putrefaciant
stomachum</span>, saith Isaac, <span class="cite">part. 5. de vol.</span>, their young ones are more
tolerable, but young pigeons he quite disapproves.

<p><i>Fishes.</i>] Rhasis and <a href="#note1360">[1360]</a>Magninus discommend all fish, and say, they
breed viscosities, slimy nutriment, little and humorous nourishment.
Savanarola adds, cold, moist: and phlegmatic, Isaac; and therefore
unwholesome for all cold and melancholy complexions: others make a
difference, rejecting only amongst freshwater fish, eel, tench, lamprey,
crawfish (which Bright approves, <span class="cite">cap. 6</span>), and such as are bred in muddy
and standing waters, and have a taste of mud, as Franciscus Bonsuetus
poetically defines, <span class="cite">Lib. de aquatilibus</span>.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Nam pisces omnes, qui stagna, lacusque frequentant,</div>
<div class="line">Semper plus succi deterioris habent.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">All fish, that standing pools, and lakes frequent,</div>
<div class="line">Do ever yield bad juice and nourishment.</div>
</div>
<p>Lampreys, Paulus Jovius, <span class="cite">c. 34. de piscibus fluvial.</span>, highly magnifies,
and saith, None speak against them, but <span lang="la">inepti et scrupulosi</span>, some
scrupulous persons; but <a href="#note1361">[1361]</a>eels, <span class="cite">c. 33</span>, <q>he abhorreth in all places,
at all times, all physicians detest them, especially about the solstice.</q>
Gomesius, <span class="cite">lib. 1. c. 22, de sale</span>, doth immoderately extol sea-fish, which
others as much vilify, and above the rest, dried, soused, indurate fish, as
ling, fumados, red-herrings, sprats, stock-fish, haberdine, poor-John, all
shellfish. <a href="#note1362">[1362]</a>Tim. Bright excepts lobster and crab. Messarius commends
salmon, which Bruerinus contradicts, <span class="cite">lib. 22. c. 17.</span> Magninus rejects
conger, sturgeon, turbot, mackerel, skate.

<p>Carp is a fish of which I know not what to determine. Franciscus Bonsuetus
accounts it a muddy fish. Hippolitus Salvianus, in his Book <span class="cite">de Piscium
natura et praeparatione</span>, which was printed at Rome in folio, 1554, with
most elegant pictures, esteems carp no better than a slimy watery meat.
Paulus Jovius on the other side, disallowing tench, approves of it; so doth
Dubravius in his Books of Fishponds. Freitagius <a href="#note1363">[1363]</a>extols it for an
excellent wholesome meat, and puts it amongst the fishes of the best rank;
and so do most of our country gentlemen, that store their ponds almost with
no other fish. But this controversy is easily decided, in my judgment, by
Bruerinus, <span class="cite">l. 22. c. 13.</span> The difference riseth from the site and nature
of pools, <a href="#note1364">[1364]</a>sometimes muddy, sometimes sweet; they are in taste as the
place is from whence they be taken. In like manner almost we may conclude
of other fresh fish. But see more in Rondoletius, Bellonius, Oribasius,
<span class="cite">lib. 7. cap. 22</span>, Isaac, <span class="cite">l. 1</span>, especially Hippolitus Salvianus, who is
<span lang="la">instar omnium solus</span>, &amp;c. Howsoever they may be wholesome and approved,
much use of them is not good; P. Forestus, in his medicinal observations,
<a href="#note1365">[1365]</a>relates, that Carthusian friars, whose living is most part fish, are
more subject to melancholy than any other order, and that he found by
experience, being sometimes their physician ordinary at Delft, in Holland.
He exemplifies it with an instance of one Buscodnese, a Carthusian of a
ruddy colour, and well liking, that by solitary living, and fish-eating,
became so misaffected.

<p><i>Herbs.</i>] Amongst herbs to be eaten I find gourds, cucumbers, coleworts,
melons, disallowed, but especially cabbage. It causeth troublesome dreams,
and sends up black vapours to the brain. Galen, <span class="cite">loc. affect. l. 3. c.
6</span>, of all herbs condemns cabbage; and Isaac, <span class="cite">lib. 2. c. 1.</span> <span lang="la">Animae
gravitatem facit</span>, it brings heaviness to the soul. Some are of opinion
that all raw herbs and salads breed melancholy blood, except bugloss and
lettuce. Crato, <span class="cite">consil. 21. lib. 2</span>, speaks against all herbs and worts,
except borage, bugloss, fennel, parsley, dill, balm, succory. Magninus,
<span class="cite">regim. sanitatis, part. 3. cap. 31.</span> <span lang="la">Omnes herbae simpliciter malae, via
cibi</span>; all herbs are simply evil to feed on (as he thinks). So did that
scoffing cook in <a href="#note1366">[1366]</a>Plautus hold:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Non ego coenam condio ut alii coqui solent,</div>
<div class="line">Qui mihi condita prata in patinis proferunt,</div>
<div class="line">Boves qui convivas faciunt, herbasque aggerunt.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">Like other cooks I do not supper dress,</div>
<div class="line">That put whole meadows into a platter,</div>
</div>
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">And make no better of their guests than beeves,</div>
<div class="line">With herbs and grass to feed them fatter.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Our Italians and Spaniards do make a whole dinner of herbs and salads
(which our said Plautus calls <span lang="la">coenas terrestras</span>, Horace, <span lang="la">coenas sine
sanguine</span>), by which means, as he follows it,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1367">[1367]</a>Hic homines tam brevem vitam colunt&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">Qui herbas hujusmodi in alvum suum congerunt,</div>
<div class="line">Formidolosum dictu, non esu modo,</div>
<div class="line">Quas herbas pecudes non edunt, homines edunt.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Their lives, that eat such herbs, must needs be short,</div>
<div class="line">And 'tis a fearful thing for to report,</div>
<div class="line">That men should feed on such a kind of meat,</div>
<div class="line">Which very juments would refuse to eat.</div>
</div>
<p><a href="#note1368">[1368]</a>They are windy, and not fit therefore to be eaten of all men raw,
though qualified with oil, but in broths, or otherwise. See more of these
in every <a href="#note1369">[1369]</a>husbandman, and herbalist.

<p><i>Roots.</i>] Roots, <span lang="la">Etsi quorundam gentium opes sint</span>, saith Bruerinus, the
wealth of some countries, and sole food, are windy and bad, or troublesome
to the head: as onions, garlic, scallions, turnips, carrots, radishes,
parsnips: Crato, <span class="cite">lib. 2. consil. 11</span>, disallows all roots, though <a href="#note1370">[1370]</a>
some approve of parsnips and potatoes. <a href="#note1371">[1371]</a>Magninus is of Crato's
opinion, <a href="#note1372">[1372]</a><q>They trouble the mind, sending gross fumes to the brain,
make men mad,</q> especially garlic, onions, if a man liberally feed on them a
year together. Guianerius, <span class="cite">tract. 15. cap. 2</span>, complains of all manner
of roots, and so doth Bruerinus, even parsnips themselves, which are the
best, <span class="cite">Lib. 9. cap. 14.</span>

<p><i>Fruits.</i>] <span lang="la">Pastinacarum usus succos gignit improbos</span>. Crato, <span class="cite">consil. 21.
lib. 1</span>, utterly forbids all manner of fruits, as pears, apples, plums,
cherries, strawberries, nuts, medlars, serves, &amp;c. <span lang="la">Sanguinem inficiunt</span>,
saith Villanovanus, they infect the blood, and putrefy it, Magninus holds,
and must not therefore be taken <span lang="la">via cibi, aut quantitate magna</span>, not to
make a meal of, or in any great quantity. <a href="#note1373">[1373]</a>Cardan makes that a cause
of their continual sickness at Fessa in Africa, <q>because they live so much
on fruits, eating them thrice a day.</q> Laurentius approves of many fruits,
in his Tract of Melancholy, which others disallow, and amongst the rest
apples, which some likewise commend, sweetings, pearmains, pippins, as good
against melancholy; but to him that is any way inclined to, or touched with
this malady, <a href="#note1374">[1374]</a>Nicholas Piso in his Practics, forbids all fruits, as
windy, or to be sparingly eaten at least, and not raw. Amongst other
fruits, <a href="#note1375">[1375]</a>Bruerinus, out of Galen, excepts grapes and figs, but I find
them likewise rejected.

<p><i>Pulse.</i>] All pulse are naught, beans, peas, vetches, &amp;c., they fill the
brain (saith Isaac) with gross fumes, breed black thick blood, and cause
troublesome dreams. And therefore, that which Pythagoras said to his
scholars of old, may be for ever applied to melancholy men, <span lang="la">A fabis
abstinete</span>, eat no peas, nor beans; yet to such as will needs eat them, I
would give this counsel, to prepare them according to those rules that
Arnoldus Villanovanus, and Frietagius prescribe, for eating, and dressing.
fruits, herbs, roots, pulse, &amp;c.

<p><i>Spices.</i>] Spices cause hot and head melancholy, and are for that cause
forbidden by our physicians to such men as are inclined to this malady, as
pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, mace, dates, &amp;c. honey and sugar. <a href="#note1376">[1376]</a>
Some except honey; to those that are cold, it may be tolerable, but <a href="#note1377">[1377]</a>
<span lang="la">Dulcia se in bilem vertunt</span>, (sweets turn into bile,) they are
obstructive. Crato therefore forbids all spice, in a consultation of his,
for a melancholy schoolmaster, <span lang="la">Omnia aromatica et quicquid sanguinem
adurit</span>: so doth Fernelius, <span class="cite">consil. 45.</span> Guianerius, <span class="cite">tract 15. cap. 2.</span>
Mercurialis, <span class="cite">cons. 189.</span> To these I may add all sharp and sour things,
luscious and over-sweet, or fat, as oil, vinegar, verjuice, mustard, salt;
as sweet things are obstructive, so these are corrosive. Gomesius, in his
books, <span class="cite">de sale, l. 1. c. 21</span>, highly commends salt; so doth Codronchus
in his tract, <span class="cite">de sale Absynthii</span>, Lemn. <span class="cite">l. 3. c. 9. de occult. nat.
mir.</span> yet common experience finds salt, and salt-meats, to be great
procurers of this disease. And for that cause belike those Egyptian priests
abstained from salt, even so much, as in their bread, <span lang="la">ut sine
perturbatione anima esset</span>, saith mine author, that their souls might be
free from perturbations.

<p><i>Bread.</i>] Bread that is made of baser grain, as peas, beans, oats, rye, or
<a href="#note1378">[1378]</a>over-hard baked, crusty, and black, is often spoken against, as
causing melancholy juice and wind. Joh. Mayor, in the first book of his
History of Scotland, contends much for the wholesomeness of oaten bread: it
was objected to him then living at Paris in France, that his countrymen fed
on oats, and base grain, as a disgrace; but he doth ingenuously confess,
Scotland, Wales, and a third part of England, did most part use that kind
of bread, that it was as wholesome as any grain, and yielded as good
nourishment. And yet Wecker out of Galen calls it horsemeat, and fitter
for juments than men to feed on. But read Galen himself, <span class="cite">Lib. 1. De cibis
boni et mali succi</span>, more largely discoursing of corn and bread.

<p><i>Wine.</i>] All black wines, over-hot, compound, strong thick drinks, as
Muscadine, Malmsey, Alicant, Rumney, Brownbastard, Metheglen, and the like,
of which they have thirty several kinds in Muscovy, all such made drinks
are hurtful in this case, to such as are hot, or of a sanguine choleric
complexion, young, or inclined to head-melancholy. For many times the
drinking of wine alone causeth it. Arculanus, <span class="cite">c. 16. in 9. Rhasis</span>, puts
in <a href="#note1379">[1379]</a>wine for a great cause, especially if it be immoderately used.
Guianerius, <span class="cite">tract. 15. c. 2</span>, tells a story of two Dutchmen, to whom he
gave entertainment in his house, <q>that <a href="#note1380">[1380]</a>in one month's space were
both melancholy by drinking of wine, one did nought but sing, the other
sigh.</q> Galen, <span class="cite">l. de causis morb. c. 3.</span> Matthiolus on Dioscorides, and
above all other Andreas Bachius, <span class="cite">l. 3. 18, 19, 20</span>, have reckoned upon
those inconveniences that come by wine: yet notwithstanding all this, to
such as are cold, or sluggish melancholy, a cup of wine is good physic, and
so doth Mercurialis grant, <span class="cite">consil. 25</span>, in that case, if the temperature
be cold, as to most melancholy men it is, wine is much commended, if it be
moderately used.

<p><i>Cider, Perry.</i>] Cider and perry are both cold and windy drinks, and for
that cause to be neglected, and so are all those hot spiced strong drinks.

<p>Beer.] Beer, if it be over-new or over-stale, over-strong, or not sodden,
smell of the cask, sharp, or sour, is most unwholesome, frets, and galls,
&amp;c. Henricus Ayrerus, in a <a href="#note1381">[1381]</a>consultation of his, for one that
laboured of hypochondriacal melancholy, discommends beer. So doth <a href="#note1382">[1382]</a>
Crato in that excellent counsel of his, <span class="cite">Lib. 2. consil. 21</span>, as too windy,
because of the hop. But he means belike that thick black Bohemian beer used
in some other parts of <a href="#note1383">[1383]</a>Germany.

</div>
As that <a href="#note1384">[1384]</a>old poet scoffed, calling it <span lang="la">Stygiae monstrum conforme
paludi</span>, a monstrous drink, like the river Styx. But let them say as they
list, to such as are accustomed unto it, <q>'tis a most wholesome</q> (so <a href="#note1385">[1385]</a>
Polydore Virgil calleth it) <q>and a pleasant drink,</q> it is more subtle and
better, for the hop that rarefies it, hath an especial virtue against
melancholy, as our herbalists confess, Fuchsius approves, <span class="cite">Lib. 2. sec. 2.
instit. cap. 11</span>, and many others.

<p>Waters] Standing waters, thick and ill-coloured, such as come forth of
pools, and moats, where hemp hath been steeped, or slimy fishes live, are
most unwholesome, putrefied, and full of mites, creepers, slimy, muddy,
unclean, corrupt, impure, by reason of the sun's heat, and still-standing;
they cause foul distemperatures in the body and mind of man, are unfit to
make drink of, to dress meat with, or to be <a href="#note1386">[1386]</a>used about men inwardly
or outwardly. They are good for many domestic uses, to wash horses, water
cattle, &amp;c., or in time of necessity, but not otherwise. Some are of
opinion, that such fat standing waters make the best beer, and that
seething doth defecate it, as <a href="#note1387">[1387]</a>Cardan holds, <span class="cite">Lib. 13. subtil.</span> <q>It
mends the substance, and savour of it,</q> but it is a paradox. Such beer may
be stronger, but not so wholesome as the other, as <a href="#note1388">[1388]</a>Jobertus truly
justifieth out of Galen, <span class="cite">Paradox, dec. 1. Paradox 5</span>, that the seething of
such impure waters doth not purge or purify them, Pliny, <span class="cite">lib. 31. c. 3</span>, is
of the same tenet, and P. Crescentius, <span class="cite">agricult. lib. 1. et lib. 4. c. 11.
et c. 45.</span> Pamphilius Herilachus, <span class="cite">l. 4. de not. aquarum</span>, such waters are
naught, not to be used, and by the testimony of <a href="#note1389">[1389]</a>Galen, <q>breed agues,
dropsies, pleurisies, splenetic and melancholy passions, hurt the eyes,
cause a bad temperature, and ill disposition of the whole body, with bad
colour.</q> This Jobertus stiffly maintains, <span class="cite">Paradox, lib. 1. part. 5</span>, that it
causeth blear eyes, bad colour, and many loathsome diseases to such as use
it: this which they say, stands with good reason; for as geographers
relate, the water of Astracan breeds worms in such as drink it. <a href="#note1390">[1390]</a>
Axius, or as now called Verduri, the fairest river in Macedonia, makes all
cattle black that taste of it. Aleacman now Peleca, another stream in
Thessaly, turns cattle most part white, <span lang="la">si polui ducas</span>, L. Aubanus
Rohemus refers that <a href="#note1391">[1391]</a>struma or poke of the Bavarians and Styrians to
the nature of their waters, as <a href="#note1392">[1392]</a>Munster doth that of Valesians in the
Alps, and <a href="#note1393">[1393]</a>Bodine supposeth the stuttering of some families in
Aquitania, about Labden, to proceed from the same cause, <q>and that the
filth is derived from the water to their bodies.</q> So that they that use
filthy, standing, ill-coloured, thick, muddy water, must needs have muddy,
ill-coloured, impure, and infirm bodies. And because the body works upon
the mind, they shall have grosser understandings, dull, foggy, melancholy
spirits, and be really subject to all manner of infirmities.

<p>To these noxious simples, we may reduce an infinite number of compound,
artificial, made dishes, of which our cooks afford us a great variety, as
tailors do fashions in our apparel. Such are <a href="#note1394">[1394]</a>puddings stuffed with
blood, or otherwise composed; baked, meats, soused indurate meats, fried
and broiled buttered meats; condite, powdered, and over-dried, <a href="#note1395">[1395]</a>all
cakes, simnels, buns, cracknels made with butter, spice, &amp;c., fritters,
pancakes, pies, sausages, and those several sauces, sharp, or over-sweet,
of which <span lang="la">scientia popinae</span>, as Seneca calls it, hath served those <a href="#note1396">[1396]</a>
Apician tricks, and perfumed dishes, which Adrian the sixth Pope so much
admired in the accounts of his predecessor Leo Decimus; and which
prodigious riot and prodigality have invented in this age. These do
generally engender gross humours, fill the stomach with crudities, and all
those inward parts with obstructions. Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 22</span>, gives instance,
in a melancholy Jew, that by eating such tart sauces, made dishes, and salt
meats, with which he was overmuch delighted, became melancholy, and was
evil affected. Such examples are familiar and common.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.2.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Quantity of Diet a Cause.</i></h4>

<p>There is not so much harm proceeding from the substance itself of meat, and
quality of it, in ill-dressing and preparing, as there is from the
quantity, disorder of time and place, unseasonable use of it, <a href="#note1397">[1397]</a>
intemperance, overmuch, or overlittle taking of it. A true saying it is,
<span lang="la">Plures crapula quam gladius</span>. This gluttony kills more than the sword,
this <span lang="la">omnivorantia et homicida gula</span>, this all-devouring and murdering gut.
And that of <a href="#note1398">[1398]</a>Pliny is truer, <q>Simple diet is the best; heaping up of
several meats is pernicious, and sauces worse; many dishes bring many
diseases.</q> <a href="#note1399">[1399]</a>Avicen cries out, <q>That nothing is worse than to feed on
many dishes, or to protract the time of meats longer than ordinary; from
thence proceed our infirmities, and 'tis the fountain of all diseases,
which arise out of the repugnancy of gross humours.</q> Thence, saith <a href="#note1400">[1400]</a>
Fernelius, come crudities, wind, oppilations, cacochymia, plethora,
cachexia, bradiopepsia, <a href="#note1401">[1401]</a><span lang="la">Hinc subitae, mortes, atque intestata
senectus</span>, sudden death, &amp;c., and what not.

<p>As a lamp is choked with a multitude of oil, or a little fire with overmuch
wood quite extinguished, so is the natural heat with immoderate eating,
strangled in the body. <span lang="la">Pernitiosa sentina est abdomen insaturabile</span>: one
saith, An insatiable paunch is a pernicious sink, and the fountain of all
diseases, both of body and mind. <a href="#note1402">[1402]</a>Mercurialis will have it a peculiar
cause of this private disease; Solenander, <span class="cite">consil. 5. sect. 3</span>, illustrates
this of Mercurialis, with an example of one so melancholy, <span lang="la">ab
intempestivis commessationibus</span>, unseasonable feasting. <a href="#note1403">[1403]</a>Crato
confirms as much, in that often cited counsel, <span class="cite">21. lib. 2</span>, putting
superfluous eating for a main cause. But what need I seek farther for
proofs? Hear <a href="#note1404">[1404]</a>Hippocrates himself, <span class="cite">lib. 2. aphor. 10</span>, <q>Impure bodies
the more they are nourished, the more they are hurt, for the nourishment is
putrefied with vicious humours.</q>

<p>And yet for all this harm, which apparently follows surfeiting and
drunkenness, see how we luxuriate and rage in this kind; read what Johannes
Stuckius hath written lately of this subject, in his great volume <span class="cite">De
Antiquorum Conviviis</span>, and of our present age; <span lang="la">Quam <a href="#note1405">[1405]</a>portentosae
coenae</span>, prodigious suppers, <a href="#note1406">[1406]</a><span lang="la">Qui dum invitant ad coenam efferunt ad
sepulchrum</span>, what Fagos, Epicures, Apetios, Heliogables, our times afford?
Lucullus' ghost walks still, and every man desires to sup in Apollo; Aesop's
costly dish is ordinarily served up. <a href="#note1407">[1407]</a><span lang="la">Magis illa juvant, quae pluris
emuntur</span>. The dearest cates are best, and 'tis an ordinary thing to bestow
twenty or thirty pounds on a dish, some thousand crowns upon a dinner:
<a href="#note1408">[1408]</a>Mully-Hamet, king of Fez and Morocco, spent three pounds on the
sauce of a capon: it is nothing in our times, we scorn all that is cheap.
<q>We loathe the very <a href="#note1409">[1409]</a>light</q> (some of us, as Seneca notes) <q>because it
comes free, and we are offended with the sun's heat, and those cool blasts,
because we buy them not.</q> This air we breathe is so common, we care not for
it; nothing pleaseth but what is dear. And if we be <a href="#note1410">[1410]</a>witty in
anything, it is <span lang="la">ad gulam</span>: If we study at all, it is <span lang="la">erudito luxu</span>, to
please the palate, and to satisfy the gut. <q>A cook of old was a base knave</q>
(as <a href="#note1411">[1411]</a>Livy complains), <q>but now a great man in request; cookery is
become an art, a noble science: cooks are gentlemen:</q> <span lang="la">Venter Deus</span>: They
wear <q>their brains in their bellies, and their guts in their heads,</q> as
<a href="#note1412">[1412]</a>Agrippa taxed some parasites of his time, rushing on their own
destruction, as if a man should run upon the point of a sword, <span lang="la">usque dum
rumpantur comedunt</span>, <q>They eat till they burst:</q> <a href="#note1413">[1413]</a>All day, all night,
let the physician say what he will, imminent danger, and feral diseases are
now ready to seize upon them, that will eat till they vomit, <span lang="la">Edunt ut
vomant, vomut ut edant</span>, saith Seneca; which Dion relates of Vitellius,
<span lang="la">Solo transitu ciborum nutriri judicatus</span>: His meat did pass through and
away, or till they burst again. <a href="#note1414">[1414]</a><span lang="la">Strage animantium ventrem onerant</span>,
and rake over all the world, as so many <a href="#note1415">[1415]</a>slaves, belly-gods, and
land-serpents, <span lang="la">Et totus orbis ventri nimis angustus</span>, the whole world
cannot satisfy their appetite. <a href="#note1416">[1416]</a><q>Sea, land, rivers, lakes, &amp;c., may
not give content to their raging guts.</q> To make up the mess, what
immoderate drinking in every place? <span lang="la">Senem potum pota trahebat anus</span>, how
they flock to the tavern: as if they were <span lang="la">fruges consumere nati</span>, born to
no other end but to eat and drink, like Offellius Bibulus, that famous
Roman parasite, <span lang="la">Qui dum vixit, aut bibit aut minxit</span>; as so many casks to
hold wine, yea worse than a cask, that mars wine, and itself is not marred
by it, yet these are brave men, Silenus Ebrius was no braver. <span lang="la">Et quae
fuerunt vitia, mores sunt</span>: 'tis now the fashion of our times, an honour:
<span lang="la">Nunc vero res ista eo rediit</span> (as Chrysost. <span class="cite">serm. 30. in v. Ephes.</span>
comments) <span lang="la">Ut effeminatae ridendaeque ignaviae loco habeatur, nolle
inebriari</span>; 'tis now come to that pass that he is no gentleman, a very
milk-sop, a clown, of no bringing up, that will not drink; fit for no
company; he is your only gallant that plays it off finest, no disparagement
now to stagger in the streets, reel, rave, &amp;c., but much to his fame and
renown; as in like case Epidicus told Thesprio his fellow-servant, in the
<a href="#note1417">[1417]</a>Poet. <span lang="la">Aedipol facinus improbum</span>, one urged, the other replied, <span lang="la">At
jam alii fecere idem, erit illi illa res honori</span>, 'tis now no fault, there
be so many brave examples to bear one out; 'tis a credit to have a strong
brain, and carry his liquor well; the sole contention who can drink most,
and fox his fellow the soonest. 'Tis the <span lang="la">summum bonum</span> of our tradesmen,
their felicity, life, and soul, <span lang="la">Tanta dulcedine affectant</span>, saith Pliny,
<span class="cite">lib. 14. cap. 12.</span> <span lang="la">Ut magna pars non aliud vitae praemium intelligat</span>, their
chief comfort, to be merry together in an alehouse or tavern, as our modern
Muscovites do in their mead-inns, and Turks in their coffeehouses, which
much resemble our taverns; they will labour hard all day long to be drunk
at night, and spend <span lang="la">totius anni labores</span>, as St. Ambrose adds, in a
tippling feast; convert day into night, as Seneca taxes some in his times,
<span lang="la">Pervertunt officia anoctis et lucis</span>; when we rise, they commonly go to
bed, like our antipodes,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Nosque ubi primus equis oriens afflavit anhelis,</div>
<div class="line">Illis sera rubens ascendit lumina vesper.</div>
</div>
So did Petronius in Tacitus, Heliogabalus in Lampridius.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1418">[1418]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Noctes vigilibat ad ipsum</div>

<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;He drank the night away</div>
<div class="line">Till rising dawn, then snored out all the day.</div>
</div>
Snymdiris the Sybarite never saw the sun rise or set so much as once in
twenty years. Verres, against whom Tully so much inveighs, in winter he
never was <span lang="la">extra tectum vix extra lectum</span>, never almost out of bed, <a href="#note1419">[1419]</a>
still wenching and drinking; so did he spend his time, and so do myriads in
our days. They have <span lang="la">gymnasia bibonum</span>, schools and rendezvous; these
centaurs and Lapithae toss pots and bowls as so many balls; invent new
tricks, as sausages, anchovies, tobacco, caviar, pickled oysters,
herrings, fumados, &amp;c.: innumerable salt meats to increase their appetite,
and study how to hurt themselves by taking antidotes <a href="#note1420">[1420]</a><q>to carry their
drink the better; <a href="#note1421">[1421]</a>and when nought else serves, they will go forth,
or be conveyed out, to empty their gorge, that they may return to drink
afresh.</q> They make laws, <span lang="la">insanas leges, contra bibendi fallacias</span>, and
<a href="#note1422">[1422]</a>brag of it when they have done, crowning that man that is soonest
gone, as their drunken predecessors have done, &mdash;<a href="#note1423">[1423]</a><span lang="la">quid ego video</span>?
Ps. <span lang="la">Cum corona Pseudolum ebrium tuum</span>&mdash;. And when they are dead, will have
a can of wine with <a href="#note1424">[1424]</a>Maron's old woman to be engraven on their tombs.
So they triumph in villainy, and justify their wickedness; with Rabelais,
that French Lucian, drunkenness is better for the body than physic, because
there be more old drunkards than old physicians. Many such frothy arguments
they have, <a href="#note1425">[1425]</a>inviting and encouraging others to do as they do, and
love them dearly for it (no glue like to that of good fellowship). So did
Alcibiades in Greece; Nero, Bonosus, Heliogabalus in Rome, or Alegabalus
rather, as he was styled of old (as <a href="#note1426">[1426]</a>Ignatius proves out of some old
coins). So do many great men still, as <a href="#note1427">[1427]</a>Heresbachius observes. When a
prince drinks till his eyes stare, like Bitias in the Poet,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1428">[1428]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;(ille impiger hausit</div>
<div class="line">Spumantem vino pateram.)</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;a thirsty soul;</div>
<div class="line">He took challenge and embrac'd the bowl;</div>
<div class="line">With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceased to draw</div>
<div class="line">Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.</div>
</div>
and comes off clearly, sound trumpets, fife and drums, the spectators will
applaud him, <q>the <a href="#note1429">[1429]</a>bishop himself (if he belie them not) with his
chaplain will stand by and do as much,</q> <span lang="la">O dignum principe haustum</span>, 'twas
done like a prince. <q>Our Dutchmen invite all comers with a pail and a
dish,</q> <span lang="la">Velut infundibula integras obbas exhauriunt, et in monstrosis
poculis, ipsi monstrosi monstrosius epotant</span>, <q>making barrels of their
bellies.</q> <span lang="la">Incredibile dictu</span>, as <a href="#note1430">[1430]</a>one of their own countrymen
complains: <a href="#note1431">[1431]</a><span lang="la">Quantum liquoris immodestissima gens capiat</span>, &amp;c. <q>How
they love a man that will be drunk, crown him and honour him for it,</q> hate
him that will not pledge him, stab him, kill him: a most intolerable
offence, and not to be forgiven. <a href="#note1432">[1432]</a><q>He is a mortal enemy that will not
drink with him,</q> as Munster relates of the Saxons. So in Poland, he is the
best servitor, and the honestest fellow, saith Alexander Gaguinus, <a href="#note1433">[1433]</a>
<q>that drinketh most healths to the honour of his master, he shall be
rewarded as a good servant, and held the bravest fellow that carries his
liquor best,</q> when a brewer's horse will bear much more than any sturdy
drinker, yet for his noble exploits in this kind, he shall be accounted a
most valiant man, for <a href="#note1434">[1434]</a><span lang="la">Tam inter epulas fortis vir esse potest ac in
bello</span>, as much valour is to be found in feasting as in fighting, and some
of our city captains, and carpet knights will make this good, and prove it.
Thus they many times wilfully pervert the good temperature of their bodies,
stifle their wits, strangle nature, and degenerate into beasts.

<p>Some again are in the other extreme, and draw this mischief on their heads
by too ceremonious and strict diet, being over-precise, cockney-like, and
curious in their observation of meats, times, as that <span lang="la">Medicina statica</span>
prescribes, just so many ounces at dinner, which Lessius enjoins, so much
at supper, not a little more, nor a little less, of such meat, and at such
hours, a diet-drink in the morning, cock-broth, China-broth, at dinner,
plum-broth, a chicken, a rabbit, rib of a rack of mutton, wing of a capon,
the merry-thought of a hen, &amp;c.; to sounder bodies this is too nice and
most absurd. Others offend in overmuch fasting: pining adays, saith <a href="#note1435">[1435]</a>
Guianerius, and waking anights, as many Moors and Turks in these our times
do. <q>Anchorites, monks, and the rest of that superstitious rank (as the
same Guianerius witnesseth, that he hath often seen to have happened in his
time) through immoderate fasting, have been frequently mad.</q> Of such men
belike Hippocrates speaks, <span class="cite">l. Aphor. 5</span>, when as he saith, <a href="#note1436">[1436]</a><q>they more
offend in too sparing diet, and are worse damnified, than they that feed
liberally, and are ready to surfeit.</q>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.2.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Custom of Diet, Delight, Appetite, Necessity, how they cause or hinder</i>.</h4>

<p>No rule is so general, which admits not some exception; to this, therefore,
which hath been hitherto said, (for I shall otherwise put most men out of
commons,) and those inconveniences which proceed from the substance of
meats, an intemperate or unseasonable use of them, custom somewhat detracts
and qualifies, according to that of Hippocrates, <span class="cite">2 Aphoris. 50.</span> <a href="#note1437">[1437]</a>
<q>Such things as we have been long accustomed to, though they be evil in
their own nature, yet they are less offensive.</q> Otherwise it might well be
objected that it were a mere <a href="#note1438">[1438]</a>tyranny to live after those strict
rules of physic; for custom <a href="#note1439">[1439]</a>doth alter nature itself, and to such as
are used to them it makes bad meats wholesome, and unseasonable times to
cause no disorder. Cider and perry are windy drinks, so are all fruits
windy in themselves, cold most part, yet in some shires of <a href="#note1440">[1440]</a>England,
Normandy in France, Guipuscoa in Spain, 'tis their common drink, and they
are no whit offended with it. In Spain, Italy, and Africa, they live most
on roots, raw herbs, camel's <a href="#note1441">[1441]</a>milk, and it agrees well with them:
which to a stranger will cause much grievance. In Wales, <span lang="la">lacticiniis
vescuntur</span>, as Humphrey Llwyd confesseth, a Cambro-Briton himself, in his
elegant epistle to Abraham Ortelius, they live most on white meats: in
Holland on fish, roots, <a href="#note1442">[1442]</a>butter; and so at this day in Greece, as
<a href="#note1443">[1443]</a>Bellonius observes, they had much rather feed on fish than flesh.
With us, <span lang="la">Maxima pars victus in carne consistit</span>, we feed on flesh most
part, saith <a href="#note1444">[1444]</a>Polydore Virgil, as all northern countries do; and it
would be very offensive to us to live after their diet, or they to live
after ours. We drink beer, they wine; they use oil, we butter; we in the
north are <a href="#note1445">[1445]</a>great eaters; they most sparing in those hotter countries;
and yet they and we following our own customs are well pleased. An
Ethiopian of old seeing an European eat bread, wondered, <span lang="la">quomodo
stercoribus vescentes viverimus</span>, how we could eat such kind of meats: so
much differed his countrymen from ours in diet, that as mine <a href="#note1446">[1446]</a>author
infers, <span lang="la">si quis illorum victum apud nos aemulari vellet</span>; if any man
should so feed with us, it would be all one to nourish, as Cicuta,
Aconitum, or Hellebore itself. At this day in China the common people live
in a manner altogether on roots and herbs, and to the wealthiest, horse,
ass, mule, dogs, cat-flesh, is as delightsome as the rest, so <a href="#note1447">[1447]</a>Mat.
Riccius the Jesuit relates, who lived many years amongst them. The Tartars
eat raw meat, and most commonly <a href="#note1448">[1448]</a>horse-flesh, drink milk and blood,
as the nomades of old. <span lang="la">Et lac concretum cum sanguine potat equino</span>. They
scoff at our Europeans for eating bread, which they call tops of weeds, and
horse meat, not fit for men; and yet Scaliger accounts them a sound and
witty nation, living a hundred years; even in the civilest country of them
they do thus, as Benedict the Jesuit observed in his travels, from the
great Mogul's Court by land to Pekin, which Riccius contends to be the same
with Cambulu in Cataia. In Scandia their bread is usually dried fish, and
so likewise in the Shetland Isles; and their other fare, as in Iceland,
saith <a href="#note1449">[1449]</a>Dithmarus Bleskenius, butter, cheese, and fish; their drink
water, their lodging on the ground. In America in many places their bread
is roots, their meat palmettos, pinas, potatoes, &amp;c., and such fruits. There
be of them too that familiarly drink <a href="#note1450">[1450]</a>salt seawater all their lives,
eat <a href="#note1451">[1451]</a>raw meat, grass, and that with delight. With some, fish,
serpents, spiders: and in divers places they <a href="#note1452">[1452]</a>eat man's flesh, raw
and roasted, even the Emperor <a href="#note1453">[1453]</a>Montezuma himself. In some coasts,
again, <a href="#note1454">[1454]</a>one tree yields them cocoanuts, meat and drink, fire, fuel,
apparel; with his leaves, oil, vinegar, cover for houses, &amp;c., and yet
these men going naked, feeding coarse, live commonly a hundred years, are
seldom or never sick; all which diet our physicians forbid. In Westphalia
they feed most part on fat meats and worts, knuckle deep, and call it
<a href="#note1455">[1455]</a><span lang="la">cerebrum Iovis</span>: in the Low Countries with roots, in Italy frogs
and snails are used. The Turks, saith Busbequius, delight most in fried
meats. In Muscovy, garlic and onions are ordinary meat and sauce, which
would be pernicious to such as are unaccustomed to them, delightsome to
others; and all is <a href="#note1456">[1456]</a>because they have been brought up unto it.
Husbandmen, and such as labour, can eat fat bacon, salt gross meat, hard
cheese, &amp;c., (<span lang="la">O dura messorum illa</span>), coarse bread at all times, go to bed
and labour upon a full stomach, which to some idle persons would be present
death, and is against the rules of physic, so that custom is all in all.
Our travellers find this by common experience when they come in far
countries, and use their diet, they are suddenly offended, <a href="#note1457">[1457]</a>as our
Hollanders and Englishmen when they touch upon the coasts of Africa, those
Indian capes and islands, are commonly molested with calentures, fluxes,
and much distempered by reason of their fruits. <a href="#note1458">[1458]</a><span lang="la">Peregrina, etsi
suavia solent vescentibus perturbationes insignes adferre</span>, strange meats,
though pleasant, cause notable alterations and distempers. On the other
side, use or custom mitigates or makes all good again. Mithridates by often
use, which Pliny wonders at, was able to drink poison; and a maid, as
Curtius records, sent to Alexander from King Porus, was brought up with
poison from her infancy. The Turks, saith Bellonius, lib. 3. c. 15, eat
opium familiarly, a dram at once, which we dare not take in grains.
<a href="#note1459">[1459]</a>Garcias ab Horto writes of one whom he saw at Goa in the East
Indies, that took ten drams of opium in three days; and yet <span lang="la">consulto
loquebatur</span>, spake understandingly, so much can custom do. <a href="#note1460">[1460]</a>
Theophrastus speaks of a shepherd that could eat hellebore in substance.
And therefore Cardan concludes out of Galen, <span lang="la">Consuetudinem utcunque
ferendam, nisi valde malam</span>. Custom is howsoever to be kept, except it be
extremely bad: he adviseth all men to keep their old customs, and that by
the authority of <a href="#note1461">[1461]</a>Hippocrates himself, <span lang="la">Dandum aliquid tempori, aetati
regioni, consuetudini</span>, and therefore to <a href="#note1462">[1462]</a>continue as they began, be
it diet, bath, exercise, &amp;c., or whatsoever else.

<p>Another exception is delight, or appetite, to such and such meats: though
they be hard of digestion, melancholy; yet as Fuchsius excepts, <span class="cite">cap. 6.
lib. 2. Instit. sect. 2</span>, <a href="#note1463">[1463]</a><q>The stomach doth readily digest, and
willingly entertain such meats we love most, and are pleasing to us, abhors
on the other side such as we distaste.</q> Which Hippocrates confirms,
<span class="cite">Aphoris. 2. 38.</span> Some cannot endure cheese, out of a secret antipathy; or to
see a roasted duck, which to others is a <a href="#note1464">[1464]</a>delightsome meat.

<p>The last exception is necessity, poverty, want, hunger, which drives men
many times to do that which otherwise they are loath, cannot endure, and
thankfully to accept of it: as beverage in ships, and in sieges of great
cities, to feed on dogs, cats, rats, and men themselves. Three outlaws in
<a href="#note1465">[1465]</a>Hector Boethius, being driven to their shifts, did eat raw flesh,
and flesh of such fowl as they could catch, in one of the Hebrides for some
few months. These things do mitigate or disannul that which hath been said
of melancholy meats, and make it more tolerable; but to such as are
wealthy, live plenteously, at ease, may take their choice, and refrain if
they will, these viands are to be forborne, if they be inclined to, or
suspect melancholy, as they tender their healths: Otherwise if they be
intemperate, or disordered in their diet, at their peril be it. <span lang="la">Qui monet
amat, Ave et cave</span>.

<h4><a name="1.2.2.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Retention and Evacuation a cause, and how</i>.</h4>

<p>Of retention and evacuation, there be divers kinds, which are either
concomitant, assisting, or sole causes many times of melancholy. <a href="#note1466">[1466]</a>
Galen reduceth defect and abundance to this head; others <a href="#note1467">[1467]</a><q>All that
is separated, or remains.</q>

<p><i>Costiveness</i>.] In the first rank of these, I may well reckon up
costiveness, and keeping in of our ordinary excrements, which as it often
causeth other diseases, so this of melancholy in particular. <a href="#note1468">[1468]</a>Celsus,
lib. 1. cap. 3, saith, <q>It produceth inflammation of the head, dullness,
cloudiness, headache,</q> &amp;c. Prosper Calenus, <span class="cite">lib. de atra bile</span>, will have
it distemper not the organ only, <a href="#note1469">[1469]</a><q>but the mind itself by troubling
of it:</q> and sometimes it is a sole cause of madness, as you may read in the
first book of <a href="#note1470">[1470]</a>Skenkius's Medicinal Observations. A young merchant
going to Nordeling fair in Germany, for ten days' space never went to
stool; at his return he was <a href="#note1471">[1471]</a>grievously melancholy, thinking that he
was robbed, and would not be persuaded but that all his money was gone; his
friends thought he had some philtrum given him, but Cnelius, a physician,
being sent for, found his <a href="#note1472">[1472]</a>costiveness alone to be the cause, and
thereupon gave him a clyster, by which he was speedily recovered.
Trincavellius, <span class="cite">consult. 35. lib. 1</span>, saith as much of a melancholy lawyer,
to whom he administered physic, and Rodericus a Fonseca, <span class="cite">consult. 85. tom.
2</span>, <a href="#note1473">[1473]</a>of a patient of his, that for eight days was bound, and therefore
melancholy affected. Other retentions and evacuations there are, not simply
necessary, but at some times; as Fernelius accounts them, <span class="cite">Path. lib. 1.
cap. 15</span>, as suppression of haemorrhoids, monthly issues in women, bleeding
at nose, immoderate or no use at all of Venus: or any other ordinary
issues.

<p><a href="#note1474">[1474]</a>Detention of haemorrhoids, or monthly issues, Villanovanus <span class="cite">Breviar.
lib. 1. cap. 18.</span> Arculanus, <span class="cite">cap. 16. in 9. Rhasis</span>, Vittorius Faventinus,
<span class="cite">pract. mag. tract. 2. cap. 15.</span> Bruel, &amp;c. put for ordinary causes.
Fuchsius, <span class="cite">l. 2. sect. 5. c. 30</span>, goes farther, and saith, <a href="#note1475">[1475]</a><q>That many
men unseasonably cured of the haemorrhoids have been corrupted with
melancholy, seeking to avoid Scylla, they fall into Charybdis.</q> Galen, <span class="cite">l.
de hum. commen. 3. ad text. 26</span>, illustrates this by an example of Lucius
Martius, whom he cured of madness, contracted by this means: And <a href="#note1476">[1476]</a>
Skenkius hath two other instances of two melancholy and mad women, so
caused from the suppression of their months. The same may be said of
bleeding at the nose, if it be suddenly stopped, and have been formerly
used, as <a href="#note1477">[1477]</a>Villanovanus urgeth: And <a href="#note1478">[1478]</a>Fuchsius, <span class="cite">lib. 2. sect. 5.
cap. 33</span>, stiffly maintains, <q>That without great danger, such an issue may
not be stayed.</q>

<p>Venus omitted produceth like effects. Mathiolus, <span class="cite">epist. 5. l.
penult.</span>, <a href="#note1479">[1479]</a><q>avoucheth of his knowledge, that some through
bashfulness abstained from venery, and thereupon became very heavy and
dull; and some others that were very timorous, melancholy, and beyond all
measure sad.</q> Oribasius, <span class="cite">med. collect. l. 6. c. 37</span>, speaks of some,
<a href="#note1480">[1480]</a><q>That if they do not use carnal copulation, are continually troubled
with heaviness and headache; and some in the same case by intermission of
it.</q> Not use of it hurts many, Arculanus, <span class="cite">c. 6. in 9. Rhasis, et
Magninus, part. 3. cap. 5</span>, think, because it <a href="#note1481">[1481]</a><q>sends up poisoned
vapours to the brain and heart.</q> And so doth Galen himself hold, <q>That if
this natural seed be over-long kept (in some parties) it turns to poison.</q>
Hieronymus Mercurialis, in his chapter of melancholy, cites it for an
especial cause of this malady, <a href="#note1482">[1482]</a>priapismus, satyriasis, &amp;c.
Haliabbas, <span class="cite">5. Theor. c. 36</span>, reckons up this and many other diseases.
Villanovanus <span class="cite">Breviar. l. 1. c. 18</span>, saith, <q>He knew <a href="#note1483">[1483]</a>many monks
and widows grievously troubled with melancholy, and that from this sole
cause.</q> <a href="#note1484">[1484]</a>Ludovicus Mercatus, <span class="cite">l. 2. de mulierum affect. cap. 4</span>,
and Rodericus a Castro, <span class="cite">de morbis mulier. l. 2. c. 3</span>, treat largely
of this subject, and will have it produce a peculiar kind of melancholy in
stale maids, nuns, and widows, <span lang="la">Ob suppressionem mensium et venerem
omissam, timidae, moestae anxiae, verecundae, suspicioscae, languentes, consilii
inopes, cum summa vitae et rerum meliorum desperatione</span>, &amp;c., they are
melancholy in the highest degree, and all for want of husbands. Aelianus
Montaltus, <span class="cite">cap. 37. de melanchol.</span>, confirms as much out of Galen; so
doth Wierus, Christophorus a Vega <span class="cite">de art. med. lib. 3. c. 14</span>, relates
many such examples of men and women, that he had seen so melancholy. Felix
Plater in the first book of his Observations, <a href="#note1485">[1485]</a><q>tells a story of an
ancient gentleman in Alsatia, that married a young wife, and was not able
to pay his debts in that kind for a long time together, by reason of his
several infirmities: but she, because of this inhibition of Venus, fell
into a horrible fury, and desired every one that came to see her, by words,
looks, and gestures, to have to do with her,</q> &amp;c. <a href="#note1486">[1486]</a>Bernardus
Paternus, a physician, saith, <q>He knew a good honest godly priest, that
because he would neither willingly marry, nor make use of the stews, fell
into grievous melancholy fits.</q> Hildesheim, <span class="cite">spicel. 2</span>, hath such another
example of an Italian melancholy priest, in a consultation had <i>Anno</i> 1580.
Jason Pratensis gives instance in a married man, that from his wife's death
abstaining, <a href="#note1487">[1487]</a><q>after marriage, became exceedingly melancholy,</q>
Rodericus a Fonseca in a young man so misaffected, <span class="cite">Tom. 2. consult. 85.</span>
To these you may add, if you please, that conceited tale of a Jew, so
visited in like sort, and so cured, out of Poggius Florentinus.

<p>Intemperate Venus is all but as bad in the other extreme. Galen, <span class="cite">l. 6.
de mortis popular. sect. 5. text. 26</span>, reckons up melancholy amongst
those diseases which are <a href="#note1488">[1488]</a><q>exasperated by venery:</q> so doth Avicenna,
<span class="cite">2, 3, c. 11.</span> Oribasius, <span class="cite">loc. citat.</span> Ficinus, <span class="cite">lib. 2. de sanitate
tuenda</span>. Marsilius Cognatus, Montaltus, <span class="cite">cap. 27.</span> Guianerius, <span class="cite">Tract. 3.
cap. 2.</span> Magninus, <span class="cite">cap. 5. part. 3.</span> <a href="#note1489">[1489]</a>gives the reason, because
<a href="#note1490">[1490]</a><q>it infrigidates and dries up the body, consumes the spirits; and
would therefore have all such as are cold and dry to take heed of and to
avoid it as a mortal enemy.</q> Jacchinus <span class="cite">in 9 Rhasis, cap. 15</span>, ascribes
the same cause, and instanceth in a patient of his, that married a young
wife in a hot summer, <a href="#note1491">[1491]</a><q>and so dried himself with chamber-work, that
he became in short space from melancholy, mad:</q> he cured him by moistening
remedies. The like example I find in Laelius a Fonte Eugubinus, <span class="cite">consult.
129</span>, of a gentleman of Venice, that upon the same occasion was first
melancholy, afterwards mad. Read in him the story at large.

<p>Any other evacuation stopped will cause it, as well as these above named,
be it bile, <a href="#note1492">[1492]</a>ulcer, issue, &amp;c. Hercules de Saxonia, <span class="cite">lib. 1. c.
16</span>, and Gordonius, verify this out of their experience. They saw one
wounded in the head who as long as the sore was open, <span lang="la">Lucida habuit mentis
intervalla</span>, was well; but when it was stopped, <span lang="la">Rediit melancholia</span>, his
melancholy fit seized on him again.

<p>Artificial evacuations are much like in effect, as hot houses, baths,
bloodletting, purging, unseasonably and immoderately used. <a href="#note1493">[1493]</a>Baths
dry too much, if used in excess, be they natural or artificial, and offend
extreme hot, or cold; <a href="#note1494">[1494]</a>one dries, the other refrigerates overmuch.
Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 137</span>, saith, they overheat the liver. Joh. Struthius,
<span class="cite">Stigmat. artis. l. 4. c. 9</span>, contends, <a href="#note1495">[1495]</a><q>that if one stay longer
than ordinary at the bath, go in too oft, or at unseasonable times, he
putrefies the humours in his body.</q> To this purpose writes Magninus, <span class="cite">l.
3. c. 5.</span> Guianerius, <span class="cite">Tract. 15. c. 21</span>, utterly disallows all hot
baths in melancholy adust. <a href="#note1496">[1496]</a><q>I saw</q> (saith he) <q>a man that laboured of
the gout, who to be freed of this malady came to the bath, and was
instantly cured of his disease, but got another worse, and that was
madness.</q> But this judgment varies as the humour doth, in hot or cold:
baths may be good for one melancholy man, bad for another; that which will
cure it in this party, may cause it in a second.

<p><i>Phlebotomy</i>.] Phlebotomy, many times neglected, may do much harm to the
body, when there is a manifest redundance of bad humours, and melancholy
blood; and when these humours heat and boil, if this be not used in time,
the parties affected, so inflamed, are in great danger to be mad; but if it
be unadvisedly, importunely, immoderately used, it doth as much harm by
refrigerating the body, dulling the spirits, and consuming them: as Joh.
<a href="#note1497">[1497]</a>Curio in his 10th chapter well reprehends, such kind of letting
blood doth more hurt than good: <a href="#note1498">[1498]</a><q>The humours rage much more than
they did before, and is so far from avoiding melancholy, that it increaseth
it, and weakeneth the sight.</q> <a href="#note1499">[1499]</a>Prosper Calenus observes as much of
all phlebotomy, except they keep a very good diet after it; yea, and as
<a href="#note1500">[1500]</a>Leonartis Jacchinus speaks out of his own experience, <a href="#note1501">[1501]</a><q>The
blood is much blacker to many men after their letting of blood than it was
at first.</q> For this cause belike Salust. Salvinianus, <span class="cite">l. 2. c. 1</span>, will
admit or hear of no bloodletting at all in this disease, except it be
manifest it proceed from blood: he was (it appears) by his own words in
that place, master of an hospital of mad men, <a href="#note1502">[1502]</a><q>and found by long
experience, that this kind of evacuation, either in head, arm, or any other
part, did more harm than good.</q> To this opinion of his, <a href="#note1503">[1503]</a>Felix
Plater is quite opposite, <q>though some wink at, disallow and quite
contradict all phlebotomy in melancholy, yet by long experience I have
found innumerable so saved, after they had been twenty, nay, sixty times
let blood, and to live happily after it. It was an ordinary thing of old,
in Galen's time, to take at once from such men six pounds of blood, which
now we dare scarce take in ounces: <span lang="la">sed viderint medici</span>;</q> great books are
written of this subject.

<p>Purging upward and downward, in abundance of bad humours omitted, may be
for the worst; so likewise as in the precedent, if overmuch, too frequent
or violent, it <a href="#note1504">[1504]</a>weakeneth their strength, saith Fuchsius, <span class="cite">l. 2.
sect., 2 c. 17</span>, or if they be strong or able to endure physic, yet it
brings them to an ill habit, they make their bodies no better than
apothecaries' shops, this and such like infirmities must needs follow.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.2.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Bad Air, a cause of Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>Air is a cause of great moment, in producing this, or any other disease,
being that it is still taken into our bodies by respiration, and our more
inner parts. <a href="#note1505">[1505]</a><q>If it be impure and foggy, it dejects the spirits, and
causeth diseases by infection of the heart,</q> as Paulus hath it, <span class="cite">lib. 1.
c. 49.</span> Avicenna, <span class="cite">lib. 1. Gal. de san. tuenda</span>. Mercurialis, Montaltus,
&amp;c. <a href="#note1506">[1506]</a>Fernelius saith, <q>A thick air thickeneth the blood and humours.</q>
<a href="#note1507">[1507]</a>Lemnius reckons up two main things most profitable, and most
pernicious to our bodies; air and diet: and this peculiar disease, nothing
sooner causeth <a href="#note1508">[1508]</a>(Jobertus holds) <q>than the air wherein we breathe and
live.</q> <a href="#note1509">[1509]</a>Such as is the air, such be our spirits; and as our spirits,
such are our humours. It offends commonly if it be too <a href="#note1510">[1510]</a>hot and dry,
thick, fuliginous, cloudy, blustering, or a tempestuous air. Bodine in his
fifth Book, <span class="cite">De repub. cap. 1, 5</span>, of his Method of History, proves that
hot countries are most troubled with melancholy, and that there are
therefore in Spain, Africa, and Asia Minor, great numbers of mad men,
insomuch that they are compelled in all cities of note, to build peculiar
hospitals for them. Leo <a href="#note1511">[1511]</a>Afer, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de Fessa urbe</span>, Ortelius
and Zuinger, confirm as much: they are ordinarily so choleric in their
speeches, that scarce two words pass without railing or chiding in common
talk, and often quarrelling in their streets. <a href="#note1512">[1512]</a>Gordonius will have
every man take notice of it: <q>Note this</q> (saith he) <q>that in hot countries it
is far more familiar than in cold.</q> Although this we have now said be not
continually so, for as <a href="#note1513">[1513]</a>Acosta truly saith, under the Equator itself,
is a most temperate habitation, wholesome air, a paradise of pleasure: the
leaves ever green, cooling showers. But it holds in such as are
intemperately hot, as <a href="#note1514">[1514]</a>Johannes a Meggen found in Cyprus, others in
Malta, Aupulia, and the <a href="#note1515">[1515]</a>Holy Land, where at some seasons of the year
is nothing but dust, their rivers dried up, the air scorching hot, and
earth inflamed; insomuch that many pilgrims going barefoot for devotion
sake, from Joppa to Jerusalem upon the hot sands, often run mad, or else
quite overwhelmed with sand, <span lang="la">profundis arenis</span>, as in many parts of
Africa, Arabia Deserta, Bactriana, now Charassan, when the west wind blows
<a href="#note1516">[1516]</a><span lang="la">Involuti arenis transeuntes necantur</span>. <a href="#note1517">[1517]</a>Hercules de Saxonia,
a professor in Venice, gives this cause why so many Venetian women are
melancholy, <span lang="la">Quod diu sub sole degant</span>, they tarry too long in the sun.
Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 21</span>, amongst other causes assigns this; Why that Jew his
patient was mad, <span lang="la">Quod tam multum exposuit se calori et frigori</span>: he
exposed himself so much to heat and cold, and for that reason in Venice,
there is little stirring in those brick paved streets in summer about noon,
they are most part then asleep: as they are likewise in the great Mogol's
countries, and all over the East Indies. At Aden in Arabia, as <a href="#note1518">[1518]</a>
Lodovicus Vertomannus relates in his travels, they keep their markets in
the night, to avoid extremity of heat; and in Ormus, like cattle in a
pasture, people of all sorts lie up to the chin in water all day long. At
Braga in Portugal; Burgos in Castile; Messina in Sicily, all over Spain and
Italy, their streets are most part narrow, to avoid the sunbeams. The Turks
wear great turbans <span lang="la">ad fugandos solis radios</span>, to refract the sunbeams; and
much inconvenience that hot air of Bantam in Java yields to our men, that
sojourn there for traffic; where it is so hot, <a href="#note1519">[1519]</a><q>that they that are
sick of the pox, lie commonly bleaching in the sun, to dry up their sores.</q>
Such a complaint I read of those isles of Cape Verde, fourteen degrees from
the Equator, they do <span lang="la">male audire</span>: <a href="#note1520">[1520]</a>One calls them the unhealthiest
clime of the world, for fluxes, fevers, frenzies, calentures, which
commonly seize on seafaring men that touch at them, and all by reason of a
hot distemperature of the air. The hardiest men are offended with this
heat, and stiffest clowns cannot resist it, as Constantine affirms,
<span class="cite">Agricult. l. 2. c. 45.</span> They that are naturally born in such air, may
not <a href="#note1521">[1521]</a>endure it, as Niger records of some part of Mesopotamia, now
called Diarbecha: <span lang="la">Quibusdam in locis saevienti aestui adeo subjecta est, ut
pleraque animalia fervore solis et coeli extinguantur</span>, 'tis so hot there
in some places, that men of the country and cattle are killed with it; and
<a href="#note1522">[1522]</a>Adricomius of Arabia Felix, by reason of myrrh, frankincense, and
hot spices there growing, the air is so obnoxious to their brains, that the
very inhabitants at some times cannot abide it, much less weaklings and
strangers. <a href="#note1523">[1523]</a>Amatus Lusitanus, <span class="cite">cent. 1. curat. 45</span>, reports of a
young maid, that was one Vincent a currier's daughter, some thirteen years
of age, that would wash her hair in the heat of the day (in July) and so
let it dry in the sun, <a href="#note1524">[1524]</a><q>to make it yellow, but by that means
tarrying too long in the heat, she inflamed her head, and made herself
mad.</q>

<p>Cold air in the other extreme is almost as bad as hot, and so doth
Montaltus esteem of it, <span class="cite">c. 11</span>, if it be dry withal. In those northern
countries, the people are therefore generally dull, heavy, and many
witches, which (as I have before quoted) Saxo Grammaticus, Olaus, Baptista
Porta ascribe to melancholy. But these cold climes are more subject to
natural melancholy (not this artificial) which is cold and dry: for which
cause <a href="#note1525">[1525]</a>Mercurius Britannicus belike puts melancholy men to inhabit
just under the Pole. The worst of the three is a <a href="#note1526">[1526]</a>thick, cloudy,
misty, foggy air, or such as come from fens, moorish grounds, lakes,
muck-hills, draughts, sinks, where any carcasses, or carrion lies, or from
whence any stinking fulsome smell comes: Galen, Avicenna, Mercurialis, new
and old physicians, hold that such air is unwholesome, and engenders
melancholy, plagues, and what not? <a href="#note1527">[1527]</a>Alexandretta, an haven-town in
the Mediterranean Sea, Saint John de Ulloa, an haven in Nova-Hispania, are
much condemned for a bad air, so are Durazzo in Albania, Lithuania,
Ditmarsh, Pomptinae Paludes in Italy, the territories about Pisa, Ferrara,
&amp;c. Romney Marsh with us; the Hundreds in Essex, the fens in Lincolnshire.
Cardan, <span class="cite">de rerum varietate, l. 17, c. 96</span>, finds fault with the sight of
those rich, and most populous cities in the Low Countries, as Bruges,
Ghent, Amsterdam, Leiden, Utrecht, &amp;c. the air is bad; and so at Stockholm
in Sweden; Regium in Italy, Salisbury with us, Hull and Lynn: they may be
commodious for navigation, this new kind of fortification, and many other
good necessary uses; but are they so wholesome? Old Rome hath descended
from the hills to the valley, 'tis the site of most of our new cities, and
held best to build in plains, to take the opportunity of rivers. Leander
Albertus pleads hard for the air and site of Venice, though the black
moorish lands appear at every low water: the sea, fire, and smoke (as he
thinks) qualify the air; and <a href="#note1528">[1528]</a>some suppose, that a thick foggy air
helps the memory, as in them of Pisa in Italy; and our Camden, out of
Plato, commends the site of Cambridge, because it is so near the fens. But
let the site of such places be as it may, how can they be excused that have
a delicious seat, a pleasant air, and all that nature can afford, and yet
through their own nastiness, and sluttishness, immund and sordid manner of
life, suffer their air to putrefy, and themselves to be chocked up? Many
cities in Turkey do <span lang="la">male audire</span> in this kind: Constantinople itself,
where commonly carrion lies in the street. Some find the same fault in
Spain, even in Madrid, the king's seat, a most excellent air, a pleasant
site; but the inhabitants are slovens, and the streets uncleanly kept.

<p>A troublesome tempestuous air is as bad as impure, rough and foul weather,
impetuous winds, cloudy dark days, as it is commonly with us, <span lang="la">Coelum visu
foedum</span>, <a href="#note1529">[1529]</a>Polydore calls it a filthy sky, <span lang="la">et in quo facile
generantur nubes</span>; as Tully's brother Quintus wrote to him in Rome, being
then quaestor in Britain. <q>In a thick and cloudy air</q> (saith Lemnius) <q>men are
tetric, sad, and peevish: And if the western winds blow, and that there be
a calm, or a fair sunshine day, there is a kind of alacrity in men's minds;
it cheers up men and beasts: but if it be a turbulent, rough, cloudy,
stormy weather, men are sad, lumpish, and much dejected, angry, waspish,
dull, and melancholy.</q> This was <a href="#note1530">[1530]</a>Virgil's experiment of old,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Verum ubi tempestas, et coeli mobilis humor</div>

moved in foul weather, dull and heavy in such tempestuous seasons? <a href="#note1531">[1531]</a>
<span lang="la">Gelidum contristat Aquarius annum</span>: the time requires, and the autumn
breeds it; winter is like unto it, ugly, foul, squalid, the air works on
all men, more or less, but especially on such as are melancholy, or
inclined to it, as Lemnius holds, <a href="#note1532">[1532]</a><q>They are most moved with it, and
those which are already mad, rave downright, either in, or against a
tempest. Besides, the devil many times takes his opportunity of such
storms, and when the humours by the air be stirred, he goes in with them,
exagitates our spirits, and vexeth our souls; as the sea waves, so are the
spirits and humours in our bodies tossed with tempestuous winds and
storms.</q> To such as are melancholy therefore, Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 24</span>, will
have tempestuous and rough air to be avoided, and <span class="cite">consil. 27</span>, all night
air, and would not have them to walk abroad, but in a pleasant day.
Lemnius, <span class="cite">l. 3. c. 3</span>, discommends the south and eastern winds, commends
the north. Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 31.</span> <a href="#note1533">[1533]</a><q>Will not any windows to be
opened in the night.</q> <span class="cite">Consil. 229. et consil. 230</span>, he discommends
especially the south wind, and nocturnal air: So doth <a href="#note1534">[1534]</a>Plutarch. The
night and darkness makes men sad, the like do all subterranean vaults, dark
houses in caves and rocks, desert places cause melancholy in an instant,
especially such as have not been used to it, or otherwise accustomed. Read

<h4><a name="1.2.2.6"></a>SUBSECT. VI.&mdash;<i>Immoderate Exercise a cause, and how. Solitariness, Idleness</i>.</h4>

<p>Nothing so good but it may be abused: nothing better than exercise (if
opportunely used) for the preservation of the body: nothing so bad if it be
unseasonable. violent, or overmuch. Fernelius out of Galen, <span class="cite">Path. lib. 1.
c. 16</span>, saith, <a href="#note1535">[1535]</a><q>That much exercise and weariness consumes the
spirits and substance, refrigerates the body; and such humours which Nature
would have otherwise concocted and expelled, it stirs up and makes them
rage: which being so enraged, diversely affect and trouble the body and
mind.</q> So doth it, if it be unseasonably used, upon a full stomach, or when
the body is full of crudities, which Fuchsius so much inveighs against,
<span class="cite">lib. 2. instit. sec. 2. c. 4</span>, giving that for a cause, why schoolboys in
Germany are so often scabbed, because they use exercise presently after
meats. <a href="#note1536">[1536]</a>Bayerus puts in a caveat against such exercise, because <q>it
<a href="#note1537">[1537]</a>corrupts the meat in the stomach, and carries the same juice raw,
and as yet undigested, into the veins</q> (saith Lemnius), <q>which there
putrefies and confounds the animal spirits.</q> Crato, <span class="cite">consil. 21. l. 2</span>,
<a href="#note1538">[1538]</a>protests against all such exercise after meat, as being the greatest
enemy to concoction that may be, and cause of corruption of humours, which
produce this, and many other diseases. Not without good reason then doth
Salust. Salvianus, <span class="cite">l. 2. c. 1</span>, and Leonartus Jacchinus, <span class="cite">in 9. Rhasis</span>,
Mercurialis, Arcubanus, and many other, set down <a href="#note1539">[1539]</a>immoderate exercise
as a most forcible cause of melancholy.

<p>Opposite to exercise is idleness (the badge of gentry) or want of exercise,
the bane of body and mind, the nurse of naughtiness, stepmother of
discipline, the chief author of all mischief, one of the seven deadly sins,
and a sole cause of this and many other maladies, the devil's cushion, as
<a href="#note1540">[1540]</a>Gualter calls it, his pillow and chief reposal. <q>For the mind can
never rest, but still meditates on one thing or other, except it be
occupied about some honest business, of his own accord it rusheth into
melancholy.</q> <a href="#note1541">[1541]</a><q>As too much and violent exercise offends on the one
side, so doth an idle life on the other</q> (saith Crato), <q>it fills the body
full of phlegm, gross humours, and all manner of obstructions, rheums,
catarrhs,</q> &amp;c. Rhasis, <span class="cite">cont. lib. 1. tract. 9</span>, accounts of it as the
greatest cause of melancholy. <a href="#note1542">[1542]</a><q>I have often seen</q> (saith he) <q>that
idleness begets this humour more than anything else.</q> Montaltus, <span class="cite">c. 1</span>,
seconds him out of his experience, <a href="#note1543">[1543]</a><q>They that are idle are far more
subject to melancholy than such as are conversant or employed about any
office or business.</q> <a href="#note1544">[1544]</a>Plutarch reckons up idleness for a sole cause
of the sickness of the soul: <q>There are they</q> (saith he) <q>troubled in mind,
that have no other cause but this.</q> Homer, <span class="cite">Iliad. 1</span>, brings in Achilles
eating of his own heart in his idleness, because he might not fight.
Mercurialis, <span class="cite">consil. 86</span>, for a melancholy young man urgeth, <a href="#note1545">[1545]</a>it as
a chief cause; why was he melancholy? because idle. Nothing begets it
sooner, increaseth and continueth it oftener than idleness.<a href="#note1546">[1546]</a>A disease
familiar to all idle persons, an inseparable companion to such as live at
ease, <span lang="la">Pingui otio desidiose agentes</span>, a life out of action, and have no
calling or ordinary employment to busy themselves about, that have small
occasions; and though they have, such is their laziness, dullness, they will
not compose themselves to do aught; they cannot abide work, though it be
necessary; easy as to dress themselves, write a letter, or the like; yet as
he that is benumbed with cold sits still shaking, that might relieve
himself with a little exercise or stirring, do they complain, but will not
use the facile and ready means to do themselves good; and so are still
tormented with melancholy. Especially if they have been formerly brought up
to business, or to keep much company, and upon a sudden come to lead a
sedentary life; it crucifies their souls, and seizeth on them in an
instant; for whilst they are any ways employed, in action, discourse, about
any business, sport or recreation, or in company to their liking, they are
very well; but if alone or idle, tormented instantly again; one day's
solitariness, one hour's sometimes, doth them more harm, than a week's
physic, labour, and company can do good. Melancholy seizeth on them
forthwith being alone, and is such a torture, that as wise Seneca well
saith, <span lang="la">Malo mihi male quam molliter esse</span>, I had rather be sick than idle.
This idleness is either of body or mind. That of body is nothing but a kind
of benumbing laziness, intermitting exercise, which, if we may believe
<a href="#note1547">[1547]</a>Fernelius, <q>causeth crudities, obstructions, excremental humours,
quencheth the natural heat, dulls the spirits, and makes them unapt to do
any thing whatsoever.</q>

As fern grows in untilled grounds, and all manner of weeds, so do gross
humours in an idle body, <span lang="la">Ignavum corrumpunt otia corpus</span>. A horse in a
stable that never travels, a hawk in a mew that seldom flies, are both
subject to diseases; which left unto themselves, are most free from any
such encumbrances. An idle dog will be mangy, and how shall an idle person
think to escape? Idleness of the mind is much worse than this of the body;
wit without employment is a disease <a href="#note1549">[1549]</a><span lang="la">Aerugo animi, rubigo ingenii</span>:
the rust of the soul, <a href="#note1550">[1550]</a>a plague, a hell itself, <span lang="la">Maximum animi
nocumentum</span>, Galen, calls it. <a href="#note1551">[1551]</a><q>As in a standing pool, worms and
filthy creepers increase, (<span lang="la">et vitium capiunt ni moveantur aquae</span>, the
water itself putrefies, and air likewise, if it be not continually stirred
by the wind) so do evil and corrupt thoughts in an idle person,</q> the soul
is contaminated. In a commonwealth, where is no public enemy, there is
likely civil wars, and they rage upon themselves: this body of ours, when
it is idle, and knows not how to bestow itself, macerates and vexeth itself
with cares, griefs, false fears, discontents, and suspicions; it tortures
and preys upon his own bowels, and is never at rest. Thus much I dare
boldly say; he or she that is idle, be they of what condition they will,
never so rich, so well allied, fortunate, happy, let them have all things
in abundance and felicity that heart can wish and desire, all contentment,
so long as he or she or they are idle, they shall never be pleased, never
well in body and mind, but weary still, sickly still, vexed still, loathing
still, weeping, sighing, grieving, suspecting, offended with the world,
with every object, wishing themselves gone or dead, or else earned away
with some foolish phantasy or other. And this is the true cause that so
many great men, ladies, and gentlewomen, labour of this disease in country
and city; for idleness is an appendix to nobility; they count it a disgrace
to work, and spend all their days in sports, recreations, and pastimes, and
will therefore take no pains; be of no vocation: they feed liberally, fare
well, want exercise, action, employment, (for to work, I say, they may not
abide,) and Company to their desires, and thence their bodies become full
of gross humours, wind, crudities; their minds disquieted, dull, heavy, &amp;c.
care, jealousy, fear of some diseases, sullen fits, weeping fits seize too
<a href="#note1552">[1552]</a>familiarly on them. For what will not fear and phantasy work in an
idle body? what distempers will they not cause? when the children of <a href="#note1553">[1553]</a>
Israel murmured against Pharaoh in Egypt, he commanded his officers to
double their task, and let them get straw themselves, and yet make their
full number of bricks; for the sole cause why they mutiny, and are evil at
ease, is, <q>they are idle.</q> When you shall hear and see so many discontented
persons in all places where you come, so many several grievances,
unnecessary complaints, fears, suspicions, <a href="#note1554">[1554]</a>the best means to redress
it is to set them awork, so to busy their minds; for the truth is, they are
idle. Well they may build castles in the air for a time, and sooth up
themselves with fantastical and pleasant humours, but in the end they will
prove as bitter as gall, they shall be still I say discontent, suspicious,
<a href="#note1555">[1555]</a>fearful, jealous, sad, fretting and vexing of themselves; so long as
they be idle, it is impossible to please them, <span lang="la">Otio qui nescit uti, plus
habet negotii quam qui negotium in negotio</span>, as that <a href="#note1556">[1556]</a>Agellius could
observe: He that knows not how to spend his time, hath more business, care,
grief, anguish of mind, than he that is most busy in the midst of all his
business. <span lang="la">Otiosus animus nescit quid volet</span>: An idle person (as he follows
it) knows not when he is well, what he would have, or whither he would go,
<span lang="la">Quum illuc ventum est, illinc lubet</span>, he is tired out with everything,
displeased with all, weary of his life: <span lang="la">Nec bene domi, nec militiae</span>,
neither at home nor abroad, <span lang="la">errat, et praeter vitam vivitur</span>, he wanders
and lives besides himself. In a word, What the mischievous effects of
laziness and idleness are, I do not find any where more accurately
expressed, than in these verses of Philolaches in the <a href="#note1557">[1557]</a>Comical Poet,
which for their elegancy I will in part insert.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

</div>
A young man is like a fair new house, the carpenter leaves it well built,
in good repair, of solid stuff; but a bad tenant lets it rain in, and for
want of reparation, fall to decay, &amp;c. Our parents, tutors, friends, spare
no cost to bring us up in our youth, in all manner of virtuous education;
but when we are left to ourselves, idleness as a tempest drives all
virtuous motions out of our minds, et <span lang="la">nihili sumus</span>, on a sudden, by sloth
and such bad ways, we come to nought.

<p>Cousin german to idleness, and a concomitant cause, which goes hand in hand
with it, is <a href="#note1558">[1558]</a><span lang="la">nimia solitudo</span>, too much solitariness, by the
testimony of all physicians, cause and symptom both; but as it is here put
for a cause, it is either coact, enforced, or else voluntary. Enforced
solitariness is commonly seen in students, monks, friars, anchorites, that
by their order and course of life must abandon all company, society of
other men, and betake themselves to a private cell: <span lang="la">Otio superstitioso
seclusi</span>, as Bale and Hospinian well term it, such as are the Carthusians
of our time, that eat no flesh (by their order), keep perpetual silence,
never go abroad. Such as live in prison, or some desert place, and cannot
have company, as many of our country gentlemen do in solitary houses, they
must either be alone without companions, or live beyond their means, and
entertain all comers as so many hosts, or else converse with their servants
and hinds, such as are unequal, inferior to them, and of a contrary
disposition: or else as some do, to avoid solitariness, spend their time
with lewd fellows in taverns, and in alehouses, and thence addict
themselves to some unlawful disports, or dissolute courses. Divers again
are cast upon this rock of solitariness for want of means, or out of a
strong apprehension of some infirmity, disgrace, or through bashfulness,
rudeness, simplicity, they cannot apply themselves to others' company.
<span lang="la">Nullum solum infelici gratius solitudine, ubi nullus sit qui miseriam
exprobret</span>; this enforced solitariness takes place, and produceth his
effect soonest in such as have spent their time jovially, peradventure in
all honest recreations, in good company, in some great family or populous
city, and are upon a sudden confined to a desert country cottage far off,
restrained of their liberty, and barred from their ordinary associates;
solitariness is very irksome to such, most tedious, and a sudden cause of
great inconvenience.

<p>Voluntary solitariness is that which is familiar with melancholy, and
gently brings on like a Siren, a shoeing-horn, or some sphinx to this
irrevocable gulf, <a href="#note1559">[1559]</a>a primary cause, Piso calls it; most pleasant it
is at first, to such as are melancholy given, to lie in bed whole days, and
keep their chambers, to walk alone in some solitary grove, betwixt wood and
water, by a brook side, to meditate upon some delightsome and pleasant
subject, which shall affect them most; <span lang="la">amabilis insania, et mentis
gratissimus error</span>: a most incomparable delight it is so to melancholise,
and build castles in the air, to go smiling to themselves, acting an
infinite variety of parts, which they suppose and strongly imagine they
represent, or that they see acted or done: <span lang="la">Blandae quidem ab initio</span>,
saith Lemnius, to conceive and meditate of such pleasant things, sometimes,
<a href="#note1560">[1560]</a><q>present, past, or to come,</q> as Rhasis speaks. So delightsome these
toys are at first, they could spend whole days and nights without sleep,
even whole years alone in such contemplations, and fantastical meditations,
which are like unto dreams, and they will hardly be drawn from them, or
willingly interrupt, so pleasant their vain conceits are, that they hinder
their ordinary tasks and necessary business, they cannot address themselves
to them, or almost to any study or employment, these fantastical and
bewitching thoughts so covertly, so feelingly, so urgently, so continually
set upon, creep in, insinuate, possess, overcome, distract, and detain
them, they cannot, I say, go about their more necessary business, stave off
or extricate themselves, but are ever musing, melancholising, and carried
along, as he (they say) that is led round about a heath with a Puck in the
night, they run earnestly on in this labyrinth of anxious and solicitous
melancholy meditations, and cannot well or willingly refrain, or easily
leave off, winding and unwinding themselves, as so many clocks, and still
pleasing their humours, until at last the scene is turned upon a sudden, by
some bad object, and they being now habituated to such vain meditations and
solitary places, can endure no company, can ruminate of nothing but harsh
and distasteful subjects. Fear, sorrow, suspicion, <span lang="la">subrusticus pudor</span>,
discontent, cares, and weariness of life surprise them in a moment, and
they can think of nothing else, continually suspecting, no sooner are their
eyes open, but this infernal plague of melancholy seizeth on them, and
terrifies their souls, representing some dismal object to their minds,
which now by no means, no labour, no persuasions they can avoid, <span lang="la">haeret
lateri lethalis arundo</span>, (the arrow of death still remains in the side),
they may not be rid of it, <a href="#note1561">[1561]</a>they cannot resist. I may not deny but
that there is some profitable meditation, contemplation, and kind of
solitariness to be embraced, which the fathers so highly commended, <a href="#note1562">[1562]</a>
Hierom, Chrysostom, Cyprian, Austin, in whole tracts, which Petrarch,
Erasmus, Stella, and others, so much magnify in their books; a paradise, a
heaven on earth, if it be used aright, good for the body, and better for
the soul: as many of those old monks used it, to divine contemplations, as
Simulus, a courtier in Adrian's time, Diocletian the emperor, retired
themselves, &amp;c., in that sense, <span lang="la">Vatia solus scit vivere</span>, Vatia lives
alone, which the Romans were wont to say, when they commended a country
life. Or to the bettering of their knowledge, as Democritus, Cleanthes, and
those excellent philosophers have ever done, to sequester themselves from
the tumultuous world, or as in Pliny's villa Laurentana, Tully's Tusculan,
Jovius' study, that they might better <span lang="la">vacare studiis et Deo</span>, serve God,
and follow their studies. Methinks, therefore, our too zealous innovators
were not so well advised in that general subversion of abbeys and religious
houses, promiscuously to fling down all; they might have taken away those
gross abuses crept in amongst them, rectified such inconveniences, and not
so far to have raved and raged against those fair buildings, and
everlasting monuments of our forefathers' devotion, consecrated to pious
uses; some monasteries and collegiate cells might have been well spared,
and their revenues otherwise employed, here and there one, in good towns or
cities at least, for men and women of all sorts and conditions to live in,
to sequester themselves from the cares and tumults of the world, that were
not desirous, or fit to marry; or otherwise willing to be troubled with
common affairs, and know not well where to bestow themselves, to live apart
in, for more conveniency, good education, better company sake, to follow
their studies (I say), to the perfection of arts and sciences, common good,
and as some truly devoted monks of old had done, freely and truly to serve
God. For these men are neither solitary, nor idle, as the poet made answer
to the husbandman in Aesop, that objected idleness to him; he was never so
idle as in his company; or that Scipio Africanus in <a href="#note1563">[1563]</a>Tully, <span lang="la">Nunquam
minus solus, quam cum solus; nunquam minus otiosus, quam quum esset
otiosus</span>; never less solitary, than when he was alone, never more busy,
than when he seemed to be most idle. It is reported by Plato in his
dialogue <span class="cite">de Amore</span>, in that prodigious commendation of Socrates, how a
deep meditation coming into Socrates' mind by chance, he stood still
musing, <span lang="la">eodem vestigio cogitabundus</span>, from morning to noon, and when as
then he had not yet finished his meditation, <span lang="la">perstabat cogitans</span>, he so
continued till the evening, the soldiers (for he then followed the camp)
observed him with admiration, and on set purpose watched all night, but he
persevered immovable <span lang="la">ad exhortim solis</span>, till the sun rose in the
morning, and then saluting the sun, went his ways. In what humour constant
Socrates did thus, I know not, or how he might be affected, but this would
be pernicious to another man; what intricate business might so really
possess him, I cannot easily guess; but this is <span lang="la">otiosum otium</span>, it is far
otherwise with these men, according to Seneca, <span lang="la">Omnia nobis mala solitudo
persuadet</span>; this solitude undoeth us, <span lang="la">pugnat cum vita sociali</span>; 'tis a
destructive solitariness. These men are devils alone, as the saying is,
<span lang="la">Homo solus aut Deus, aut Daemon</span>: a man alone, is either a saint or a
devil, <span lang="la">mens ejus aut languescit, aut tumescit</span>; and <a href="#note1564">[1564]</a><span lang="la">Vae soli</span> in
this sense, woe be to him that is so alone. These wretches do frequently
degenerate from men, and of sociable creatures become beasts, monsters,
inhumane, ugly to behold, <span lang="la">Misanthropi</span>; they do even loathe themselves,
and hate the company of men, as so many Timons, Nebuchadnezzars, by too
much indulging to these pleasing humours, and through their own default. So
that which Mercurialis, <span class="cite">consil. 11</span>, sometimes expostulated with his
melancholy patient, may be justly applied to every solitary and idle person
in particular. <a href="#note1565">[1565]</a><span lang="la">Natura de te videtur conqueri posse</span>, &amp;c. <q>Nature
may justly complain of thee, that whereas she gave thee a good wholesome
temperature, a sound body, and God hath given thee so divine and excellent
a soul, so many good parts, and profitable gifts, thou hast not only
contemned and rejected, but hast corrupted them, polluted them, overthrown
their temperature, and perverted those gifts with riot, idleness,
solitariness, and many other ways, thou art a traitor to God and nature, an
enemy to thyself and to the world.</q> <span lang="la">Perditio tua ex te</span>; thou hast lost
thyself wilfully, cast away thyself, <q>thou thyself art the efficient cause
of thine own misery, by not resisting such vain cogitations, but giving way
unto them.</q>

<h4><a name="1.2.2.7"></a>SUBSECT. VII.&mdash;<i>Sleeping and Waking, Causes</i>.</h4>

<p>What I have formerly said of exercise, I may now repeat of sleep. Nothing
better than moderate sleep, nothing worse than it, if it be in extremes, or
unseasonably used. It is a received opinion, that a melancholy man cannot
sleep overmuch; <span lang="la">Somnus supra modum prodest</span>, as an only antidote, and
nothing offends them more, or causeth this malady sooner, than waking, yet
in some cases sleep may do more harm than good, in that phlegmatic,
swinish, cold, and sluggish melancholy which Melancthon speaks of, that
thinks of waters, sighing most part, &amp;c. <a href="#note1566">[1566]</a>It dulls the spirits, if
overmuch, and senses; fills the head full of gross humours; causeth
distillations, rheums, great store of excrements in the brain, and all the
other parts, as <a href="#note1567">[1567]</a>Fuchsius speaks of them, that sleep like so many
dormice. Or if it be used in the daytime, upon a full stomach, the body
ill-composed to rest, or after hard meats, it increaseth fearful dreams,
incubus, night walking, crying out, and much unquietness; such sleep
prepares the body, as <a href="#note1568">[1568]</a>one observes, <q>to many perilous diseases.</q>
But, as I have said, waking overmuch, is both a symptom, and an ordinary
cause. <q>It causeth dryness of the brain, frenzy, dotage, and makes the body
dry, lean, hard, and ugly to behold,</q> as <a href="#note1569">[1569]</a>Lemnius hath it. <q>The
temperature of the brain is corrupted by it, the humours adust, the eyes
made to sink into the head, choler increased, and the whole body inflamed:</q>
and, as may be added out of Galen, <span class="cite">3. de sanitate tuendo</span>, Avicenna <span class="cite">3. 1.</span>
<a href="#note1570">[1570]</a><q>It overthrows the natural heat, it causeth crudities, hurts,
concoction,</q> and what not? Not without good cause therefore Crato, <span class="cite">consil.
21. lib. 2</span>; Hildesheim, <span class="cite">spicel. 2. de delir. et Mania</span>, Jacchinus,
Arculanus on Rhasis, Guianerius and Mercurialis, reckon up this overmuch
waking as a principal cause.

<h4><a name="1.2.3.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Passions and Perturbations of the Mind, how they cause Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>As that gymnosophist in <a href="#note1571">[1571]</a>Plutarch made answer to Alexander (demanding
which spake best), Every one of his fellows did speak better than the
other: so may I say of these causes; to him that shall require which is the
greatest, every one is more grievous than other, and this of passion the
greatest of all. A most frequent and ordinary cause of melancholy, <a href="#note1572">[1572]</a>
<span lang="la">fulmen perturbationum</span> (Picolomineus calls it) this thunder and lightning
of perturbation, which causeth such violent and speedy alterations in this
our microcosm, and many times subverts the good estate and temperature of
it. For as the body works upon the mind by his bad humours, troubling the
spirits, sending gross fumes into the brain, and so <span lang="la">per consequens</span>
disturbing the soul, and all the faculties of it,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1573">[1573]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Corpus onustum,</div>
<div class="line">Hesternis vitiis animum quoque praegravat una,</div>
</div>
with fear, sorrow, &amp;c., which are ordinary symptoms of this disease: so on
the other side, the mind most effectually works upon the body, producing by
his passions and perturbations miraculous alterations, as melancholy,
despair, cruel diseases, and sometimes death itself. Insomuch that it is
most true which Plato saith in his Charmides, <span lang="la">omnia corporis mala ab anima
procedere</span>; all the <a href="#note1574">[1574]</a>mischiefs of the body proceed from the soul: and
Democritus in <a href="#note1575">[1575]</a>Plutarch urgeth, <span lang="la">Damnatam iri animam a corpore</span>, if
the body should in this behalf bring an action against the soul, surely the
soul would be cast and convicted, that by her supine negligence had caused
such inconveniences, having authority over the body, and using it for an
instrument, as a smith doth his hammer (saith <a href="#note1576">[1576]</a>Cyprian), imputing all
those vices and maladies to the mind. Even so doth <a href="#note1577">[1577]</a>Philostratus,
<span lang="la">non coinquinatur corpus, nisi consensuanimae</span>; the body is not corrupted,
but by the soul. Lodovicus Vives will have such turbulent commotions
proceed from ignorance and indiscretion. <a href="#note1578">[1578]</a>All philosophers impute the
miseries of the body to the soul, that should have governed it better, by
command of reason, and hath not done it. The Stoics are altogether of
opinion (as <a href="#note1579">[1579]</a>Lipsius and <a href="#note1580">[1580]</a>Picolomineus record), that a wise
man should be <span lang="gr">&#x1F00;&pi;&alpha;&theta;&#x1F75;&sigmaf;</span>, without all manner of passions and
perturbations whatsoever, as <a href="#note1581">[1581]</a>Seneca reports of Cato, the <a href="#note1582">[1582]</a>
Greeks of Socrates, and <a href="#note1583">[1583]</a>Io. Aubanus of a nation in Africa, so free
from passion, or rather so stupid, that if they be wounded with a sword,
they will only look back. <a href="#note1584">[1584]</a>Lactantius, <span class="cite">2 instit.</span>, will exclude
<q>fear from a wise man:</q> others except all, some the greatest passions. But
let them dispute how they will, set down in Thesi, give precepts to the
contrary; we find that of <a href="#note1585">[1585]</a>Lemnius true by common experience; <q>No
mortal man is free from these perturbations: or if he be so, sure he is
either a god, or a block.</q> They are born and bred with us, we have them
from our parents by inheritance. <span lang="la">A parentibus habemus malum hunc assem</span>,
saith <a href="#note1586">[1586]</a>Pelezius, <span lang="la">Nascitur una nobiscum, aliturque</span>, 'tis propagated
from Adam, Cain was melancholy, <a href="#note1587">[1587]</a>as Austin hath it, and who is not?
Good discipline, education, philosophy, divinity (I cannot deny), may
mitigate and restrain these passions in some few men at some times, but
most part they domineer, and are so violent, <a href="#note1588">[1588]</a>that as a torrent
(<span lang="la">torrens velut aggere rupto</span>) bears down all before, and overflows his
banks, <span lang="la">sternit agros, sternit sata</span>, (lays waste the fields, prostrates
the crops,) they overwhelm reason, judgment, and pervert the temperature of
the body; <span lang="la">Fertur <a href="#note1589">[1589]</a> equis auriga, nec audit currus habenas</span>. Now
such a man (saith <a href="#note1590">[1590]</a>Austin) <q>that is so led, in a wise man's eye, is
no better than he that stands upon his head.</q> It is doubted by some,
<span lang="la">Gravioresne morbi a perturbationibus, an ab humoribus</span>, whether humours or
perturbations cause the more grievous maladies. But we find that of our
Saviour, <span class="bibcite">Mat. xxvi. 41</span>, most true, <q>The spirit is willing, the flesh is
weak,</q> we cannot resist; and this of <a href="#note1591">[1591]</a>Philo Judeus, <q>Perturbations
often offend the body, and are most frequent causes of melancholy, turning
it out of the hinges of his health.</q> Vives compares them to <a href="#note1592">[1592]</a><q>Winds
upon the sea, some only move as those great gales, but others turbulent
quite overturn the ship.</q> Those which are light, easy, and more seldom, to
our thinking, do us little harm, and are therefore contemned of us: yet if
they be reiterated, <a href="#note1593">[1593]</a><q>as the rain</q> (saith Austin) <q>doth a stone, so do
these perturbations penetrate the mind:</q> <a href="#note1594">[1594]</a>and (as one observes)
<q>produce a habit of melancholy at the last,</q> which having gotten the mastery
in our souls, may well be called diseases.

<p>How these passions produce this effect, <a href="#note1595">[1595]</a>Agrippa hath handled at
large, <span class="cite">Occult. Philos. l. 11. c. 63.</span> Cardan, <span class="cite">l. 14. subtil.</span>
Lemnius, <span class="cite">l. 1. c. 12, de occult. nat. mir. et lib. 1. cap. 16.</span>
Suarez, <span class="cite">Met. disput. 18. sect. 1. art. 25.</span> T. Bright, <span class="cite">cap. 12.</span> of
his Melancholy Treatise. Wright the Jesuit, in his Book of the Passions of
the Mind, &amp;c. Thus in brief, to our imagination cometh by the outward sense
or memory, some object to be known (residing in the foremost part of the
brain), which he misconceiving or amplifying presently communicates to the
heart, the seat of all affections. The pure spirits forthwith flock from
the brain to the heart, by certain secret channels, and signify what good
or bad object was presented; <a href="#note1596">[1596]</a>which immediately bends itself to
prosecute, or avoid it; and withal, draweth with it other humours to help
it: so in pleasure, concur great store of purer spirits; in sadness, much
melancholy blood; in ire, choler. If the imagination be very apprehensive,
intent, and violent, it sends great store of spirits to, or from the heart,
and makes a deeper impression, and greater tumult, as the humours in the
body be likewise prepared, and the temperature itself ill or well disposed,
the passions are longer and stronger; so that the first step and fountain
of all our grievances in this kind, is <a href="#note1597">[1597]</a><span lang="la">laesa imaginatio</span>, which
misinforming the heart, causeth all these distemperatures, alteration and
confusion of spirits and humours. By means of which, so disturbed,
concoction is hindered, and the principal parts are much debilitated; as
<a href="#note1598">[1598]</a>Dr. Navarra well declared, being consulted by Montanus about a
melancholy Jew. The spirits so confounded, the nourishment must needs be
abated, bad humours increased, crudities and thick spirits engendered with
melancholy blood. The other parts cannot perform their functions, having
the spirits drawn from them by vehement passion, but fail in sense and
motion; so we look upon a thing, and see it not; hear, and observe not;
which otherwise would much affect us, had we been free. I may therefore
conclude with <a href="#note1599">[1599]</a>Arnoldus, <span lang="la">Maxima vis est phantasiae, et huic uni fere,
non autem corporis intemperiei, omnis melancholiae causa est ascribenda</span>:
<q>Great is the force of imagination, and much more ought the cause of
melancholy to be ascribed to this alone, than to the distemperature of the
body.</q> Of which imagination, because it hath so great a stroke in producing
this malady, and is so powerful of itself, it will not be improper to my
discourse, to make a brief digression, and speak of the force of it, and
how it causeth this alteration. Which manner of digression, howsoever some
dislike, as frivolous and impertinent, yet I am of <a href="#note1600">[1600]</a>Beroaldus's
opinion, <q>Such digressions do mightily delight and refresh a weary reader,
they are like sauce to a bad stomach, and I do therefore most willingly use
them.</q>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.3.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Of the Force of Imagination</i>.</h4>

<p>What imagination is, I have sufficiently declared in my digression of the
anatomy of the soul. I will only now point at the wonderful effects and
power of it; which, as it is eminent in all, so most especially it rageth
in melancholy persons, in keeping the species of objects so long,
mistaking, amplifying them by continual and <a href="#note1601">[1601]</a>strong meditation, until
at length it produceth in some parties real effects, causeth this, and many
other maladies. And although this phantasy of ours be a subordinate faculty
to reason, and should be ruled by it, yet in many men, through inward or
outward distemperatures, defect of organs, which are unapt, or otherwise
contaminated, it is likewise unapt, or hindered, and hurt. This we see
verified in sleepers, which by reason of humours and concourse of vapours
troubling the phantasy, imagine many times absurd and prodigious things,
and in such as are troubled with incubus, or witch-ridden (as we call it),
if they lie on their backs, they suppose an old woman rides, and sits so
hard upon them, that they are almost stifled for want of breath; when there
is nothing offends, but a concourse of bad humours, which trouble the
phantasy. This is likewise evident in such as walk in the night in their
sleep, and do strange feats: <a href="#note1602">[1602]</a>these vapours move the phantasy, the
phantasy the appetite, which moving the animal spirits causeth the body to
walk up and down as if they were awake. Fracast. <span class="cite">l. 3. de intellect</span>,
refers all ecstasies to this force of imagination, such as lie whole days
together in a trance: as that priest whom <a href="#note1603">[1603]</a>Celsus speaks of, that
could separate himself from his senses when he list, and lie like a dead
man, void of life and sense. Cardan brags of himself, that he could do as
much, and that when he list. Many times such men when they come to
themselves, tell strange things of heaven and hell, what visions they have
seen; as that St. Owen, in Matthew Paris, that went into St. Patrick's
purgatory, and the monk of Evesham in the same author. Those common
apparitions in Bede and Gregory, Saint Bridget's revelations, Wier. <span class="cite">l. 3.
de lamiis, c. 11.</span> Caesar Vanninus, in his Dialogues, &amp;c. reduceth (as I
have formerly said), with all those tales of witches' progresses, dancing,
riding, transformations, operations, &amp;c. to the force of <a href="#note1604">[1604]</a>
imagination, and the <a href="#note1605">[1605]</a>devil's illusions. The like effects almost are
to be seen in such as are awake: how many chimeras, antics, golden
mountains and castles in the air do they build unto themselves? I appeal to
painters, mechanicians, mathematicians. Some ascribe all vices to a false
and corrupt imagination, anger, revenge, lust, ambition, covetousness,
which prefers falsehood before that which is right and good, deluding the
soul with false shows and suppositions. <a href="#note1606">[1606]</a>Bernardus Penottus will have
heresy and superstition to proceed from this fountain; as he falsely
imagineth, so he believeth; and as he conceiveth of it, so it must be, and
it shall be, <span lang="la">contra gentes</span>, he will have it so. But most especially in
passions and affections, it shows strange and evident effects: what will
not a fearful man conceive in the dark? What strange forms of bugbears,
devils, witches, goblins? Lavater imputes the greatest cause of spectrums,
and the like apparitions, to fear, which above all other passions begets
the strongest imagination (saith <a href="#note1607">[1607]</a>Wierus), and so likewise love,
sorrow, joy, &amp;c. Some die suddenly, as she that saw her son come from the
battle at Cannae, &amp;c. Jacob the patriarch, by force of imagination, made
speckled lambs, laying speckled rods before his sheep. Persina, that
Ethiopian queen in Heliodorus, by seeing the picture of Persius and
Andromeda, instead of a blackamoor, was brought to bed of a fair white
child. In imitation of whom belike, a hard-favoured fellow in Greece,
because he and his wife were both deformed, to get a good brood of
children, <span lang="la">Elegantissimas imagines in thalamo collocavit</span>, &amp;c. hung the
fairest pictures he could buy for money in his chamber, <q>That his wife by
frequent sight of them, might conceive and bear such children.</q> And if we
may believe Bale, one of Pope Nicholas the Third's concubines by seeing of
<a href="#note1608">[1608]</a>a bear was brought to bed of a monster. <q>If a woman</q> (saith <a href="#note1609">[1609]</a>
Lemnius), <q>at the time of her conception think of another man present or
absent, the child will be like him.</q> Great-bellied women, when they long,
yield us prodigious examples in this kind, as moles, warts, scars,
harelips, monsters, especially caused in their children by force of a
depraved phantasy in them: <span lang="la">Ipsam speciem quam animo effigiat, faetui
inducit</span>: She imprints that stamp upon her child which she <a href="#note1610">[1610]</a>conceives
unto herself. And therefore Lodovicus Vives, <span class="cite">lib. 2. de Christ, faem.</span>,
gives a special caution to great-bellied women, <a href="#note1611">[1611]</a><q>that they do not
admit such absurd conceits and cogitations, but by all means avoid those
horrible objects, heard or seen, or filthy spectacles.</q> Some will laugh,
weep, sigh, groan, blush, tremble, sweat, at such things as are suggested
unto them by their imagination. Avicenna speaks of one that could cast
himself into a palsy when he list; and some can imitate the tunes of birds
and beasts that they can hardly be discerned: Dagebertus' and Saint
Francis' scars and wounds, like those of Christ's (if at the least any such
were), <a href="#note1612">[1612]</a>Agrippa supposeth to have happened by force of imagination:
that some are turned to wolves, from men to women, and women again to men
(which is constantly believed) to the same imagination; or from men to
asses, dogs, or any other shapes. <a href="#note1613">[1613]</a>Wierus ascribes all those famous
transformations to imagination; that in hydrophobia they seem to see the
picture of a dog, still in their water, <a href="#note1614">[1614]</a>that melancholy men and sick
men conceive so many fantastical visions, apparitions to themselves, and
have such absurd apparitions, as that they are kings, lords, cocks, bears,
apes, owls; that they are heavy, light, transparent, great and little,
senseless and dead (as shall be showed more at large, in our <a href="#note1615">[1615]</a>
sections of symptoms), can be imputed to nought else, but to a corrupt,
false, and violent imagination. It works not in sick and melancholy men
only, but even most forcibly sometimes in such as are sound: it makes them
suddenly sick, and <a href="#note1616">[1616]</a>alters their temperature in an instant. And
sometimes a strong conceit or apprehension, as <a href="#note1617">[1617]</a>Valesius proves, will
take away diseases: in both kinds it will produce real effects. Men, if
they see but another man tremble, giddy or sick of some fearful disease,
their apprehension and fear is so strong in this kind, that they will have
the same disease. Or if by some soothsayer, wiseman, fortune-teller, or
physician, they be told they shall have such a disease, they will so
seriously apprehend it, that they will instantly labour of it. A thing
familiar in China (saith Riccius the Jesuit), <a href="#note1618">[1618]</a><q>If it be told them
they shall be sick on such a day, when that day comes they will surely be
sick, and will be so terribly afflicted, that sometimes they die upon it.</q>
Dr. Cotta in his discovery of ignorant practitioners of physic, <span class="cite">cap. 8</span>,
hath two strange stories to this purpose, what fancy is able to do. The one
of a parson's wife in Northamptonshire, <i>An.</i> 1607, that coming to a
physician, and told by him that she was troubled with the sciatica, as he
conjectured (a disease she was free from), the same night after her return,
upon his words, fell into a grievous fit of a sciatica: and such another
example he hath of another good wife, that was so troubled with the cramp,
after the same manner she came by it, because her physician did but name
it. Sometimes death itself is caused by force of phantasy. I have heard of
one that coming by chance in company of him that was thought to be sick of
the plague (which was not so) fell down suddenly dead. Another was sick of
the plague with conceit. One seeing his fellow let blood falls down in a
swoon. Another (saith <a href="#note1619">[1619]</a>Cardan out of Aristotle), fell down dead
(which is familiar to women at any ghastly sight), seeing but a man hanged.
A Jew in France (saith <a href="#note1620">[1620]</a>Lodovicus Vives), came by chance over a
dangerous passage or plank, that lay over a brook in the dark, without
harm, the next day perceiving what danger he was in, fell down dead. Many
will not believe such stories to be true, but laugh commonly, and deride
when they hear of them; but let these men consider with themselves, as
<a href="#note1621">[1621]</a>Peter Byarus illustrates it, If they were set to walk upon a plank
on high, they would be giddy, upon which they dare securely walk upon the
ground. Many (saith Agrippa), <a href="#note1622">[1622]</a><q>strong-hearted men otherwise, tremble
at such sights, dazzle, and are sick, if they look but down from a high
place, and what moves them but conceit?</q> As some are so molested by
phantasy; so some again, by fancy alone, and a good conceit, are as easily
recovered. We see commonly the toothache, gout, falling-sickness, biting
of a mad dog, and many such maladies cured by spells, words, characters,
and charms, and many green wounds by that now so much used <span lang="la">Unguentum
Armarium</span>, magnetically cured, which Crollius and Goclenius in a book of
late hath defended, Libavius in a just tract as stiffly contradicts, and
most men controvert. All the world knows there is no virtue in such charms
or cures, but a strong conceit and opinion alone, as <a href="#note1623">[1623]</a>Pomponatius
holds, <q>which forceth a motion of the humours, spirits, and blood, which
takes away the cause of the malady from the parts affected.</q> The like we
may say of our magical effects, superstitious cures, and such as are done
by mountebanks and wizards. <q>As by wicked incredulity many men are hurt</q> (so
saith <a href="#note1624">[1624]</a>Wierus of charms, spells, &amp;c.), <q>we find in our experience, by
the same means many are relieved.</q> An empiric oftentimes, and a silly
chirurgeon, doth more strange cures than a rational physician. Nymannus
gives a reason, because the patient puts his confidence in him, <a href="#note1625">[1625]</a>
which Avicenna <q>prefers before art, precepts, and all remedies whatsoever.</q>
'Tis opinion alone (saith <a href="#note1626">[1626]</a>Cardan), that makes or mars physicians,
and he doth the best cures, according to Hippocrates, in whom most trust.
So diversely doth this phantasy of ours affect, turn, and wind, so
imperiously command our bodies, which as another <a href="#note1627">[1627]</a><q>Proteus, or a
chameleon, can take all shapes; and is of such force (as Ficinus adds),
that it can work upon others, as well as ourselves.</q> How can otherwise
blear eyes in one man cause the like affection in another? Why doth one
man's yawning <a href="#note1628">[1628]</a>make another yawn? One man's pissing provoke a second
many times to do the like? Why doth scraping of trenchers offend a third,
or hacking of files? Why doth a carcass bleed when the murderer is brought
before it, some weeks after the murder hath been done? Why do witches and
old women fascinate and bewitch children: but as Wierus, Paracelsus,
Cardan, Mizaldus, Valleriola, Caesar Vanninus, Campanella, and many
philosophers think, the forcible imagination of the one party moves and
alters the spirits of the other. Nay more, they can cause and cure not only
diseases, maladies, and several infirmities, by this means, as Avicenna,
<span class="cite">de anim. l. 4. sect. 4</span>, supposeth in parties remote, but move bodies
from their places, cause thunder, lightning, tempests, which opinion
Alkindus, Paracelsus, and some others, approve of. So that I may certainly
conclude this strong conceit or imagination is <span lang="la">astrum hominis</span>, and the
rudder of this our ship, which reason should steer, but, overborne by
phantasy, cannot manage, and so suffers itself, and this whole vessel of
ours to be overruled, and often overturned. Read more of this in Wierus,
<span class="cite">l. 3. de Lamiis, c. 8, 9, 10.</span> Franciscus Valesius, <span class="cite">med. controv. l.
5. cont. 6.</span> Marcellus Donatus, <span class="cite">l. 2. c. 1. de hist. med. mirabil</span>.
Levinus Lemnius, <span class="cite">de occult. nat. mir. l. 1. c. 12.</span> Cardan, <span class="cite">l. 18. de

and him that is <span lang="la">instar omnium</span>, Fienus, a famous physician of Antwerp,
that wrote three books <span lang="la">de viribus imaginationis</span>. I have thus far
digressed, because this imagination is the medium deferens of passions, by
whose means they work and produce many times prodigious effects: and as the
phantasy is more or less intended or remitted, and their humours disposed,
so do perturbations move, more or less, and take deeper impression.

<h4><a name="1.2.3.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Division of Perturbations</i>.</h4>

<p>Perturbations and passions, which trouble the phantasy, though they dwell
between the confines of sense and reason, yet they rather follow sense than
reason, because they are drowned in corporeal organs of sense. They are
commonly <a href="#note1629">[1629]</a>reduced into two inclinations, irascible and concupiscible.
The Thomists subdivide them into eleven, six in the coveting, and five in
the invading. Aristotle reduceth all to pleasure and pain, Plato to love
and hatred, <a href="#note1630">[1630]</a>Vives to good and bad. If good, it is present, and then
we absolutely joy and love; or to come, and then we desire and hope for it.
If evil, we absolute hate it; if present, it is by sorrow; if to come fear.
These four passions <a href="#note1631">[1631]</a>Bernard compares <q>to the wheels of a chariot, by
which we are carried in this world.</q> All other passions are subordinate
unto these four, or six, as some will: love, joy, desire, hatred, sorrow,
fear; the rest, as anger, envy, emulation, pride, jealousy, anxiety, mercy,
shame, discontent, despair, ambition, avarice, &amp;c., are reducible unto the
first; and if they be immoderate, they <a href="#note1632">[1632]</a>consume the spirits, and
melancholy is especially caused by them. Some few discreet men there are,
that can govern themselves, and curb in these inordinate affections, by
religion, philosophy, and such divine precepts, of meekness, patience, and
the like; but most part for want of government, out of indiscretion,
ignorance, they suffer themselves wholly to be led by sense, and are so far
from repressing rebellious inclinations, that they give all encouragement
unto them, leaving the reins, and using all provocations to further them:
bad by nature, worse by art, discipline, <a href="#note1633">[1633]</a>custom, education, and a
perverse will of their own, they follow on, wheresoever their unbridled
affections will transport them, and do more out of custom, self-will, than
out of reason. <span lang="la">Contumax voluntas</span>, as Melancthon calls it, <span lang="la">malum facit</span>:
this stubborn will of ours perverts judgment, which sees and knows what
should and ought to be done, and yet will not do it. <span lang="la">Mancipia gulae</span>,
slaves to their several lusts and appetite, they precipitate and plunge
<a href="#note1634">[1634]</a>themselves into a labyrinth of cares, blinded with lust, blinded
with ambition; <a href="#note1635">[1635]</a><q>They seek that at God's hands which they may give
unto themselves, if they could but refrain from those cares and
perturbations, wherewith they continually macerate their minds.</q> But giving
way to these violent passions of fear, grief, shame, revenge, hatred,
malice, &amp;c., they are torn in pieces, as Actaeon was with his dogs, and
<a href="#note1636">[1636]</a>crucify their own souls.

<h4><a name="1.2.3.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Sorrow a Cause of Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Sorrow. Insanus dolor</i>.] In this catalogue of passions, which so much
torment the soul of man, and cause this malady, (for I will briefly speak
of them all, and in their order,) the first place in this irascible
appetite, may justly be challenged by sorrow. An inseparable companion,
<a href="#note1637">[1637]</a><q>The mother and daughter of melancholy, her epitome, symptom, and
chief cause:</q> as Hippocrates hath it, they beget one another, and tread in
a ring, for sorrow is both cause and symptom of this disease. How it is a
symptom shall be shown in its place. That it is a cause all the world
acknowledgeth, <span lang="la">Dolor nonnullis insaniae causa fuit, et aliorum morborum
insanabilium</span>, saith Plutarch to Apollonius; a cause of madness, a cause of
many other diseases, a sole cause of this mischief, <a href="#note1638">[1638]</a>Lemnius calls
it. So doth Rhasis, <span class="cite">cont. l. 1. tract. 9.</span> Guianerius, <span class="cite">Tract. 15. c.
5</span>, And if it take root once, it ends in despair, as <a href="#note1639">[1639]</a>Felix Plater
observes, and as in <a href="#note1640">[1640]</a>Cebes' table, may well be coupled with it.
<a href="#note1641">[1641]</a>Chrysostom, in his seventeenth epistle to Olympia, describes it to
be <q>a cruel torture of the soul, a most inexplicable grief, poisoned worm,
consuming body and soul, and gnawing the very heart, a perpetual
executioner, continual night, profound darkness, a whirlwind, a tempest, an
ague not appearing, heating worse than any fire, and a battle that hath no
end. It crucifies worse than any tyrant; no torture, no strappado, no
bodily punishment is like unto it.</q> 'Tis the eagle without question which
the poets feigned to gnaw <a href="#note1642">[1642]</a>Prometheus' heart, and <q>no heaviness is
like unto the heaviness of the heart,</q> <span class="bibcite">Eccles. xxv. 15, 16</span>. <a href="#note1643">[1643]</a><q>Every
perturbation is a misery, but grief a cruel torment,</q> a domineering
passion: as in old Rome, when the Dictator was created, all inferior
magistracies ceased; when grief appears, all other passions vanish. <q>It
dries up the bones,</q> saith Solomon, <span class="bibcite">cap. 17. Prov.</span>, makes them hollow-eyed,
pale, and lean, furrow-faced, to have dead looks, wrinkled brows,
shrivelled cheeks, dry bodies, and quite perverts their temperature that
are misaffected with it. As Eleonara, that exiled mournful duchess (in our
<a href="#note1644">[1644]</a>English Ovid), laments to her noble husband Humphrey, Duke of
Gloucester,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Sawest thou those eyes in whose sweet cheerful look</div>
<div class="line">Duke Humphrey once such joy and pleasure took,</div>
<div class="line">Sorrow hath so despoil'd me of all grace,</div>
<div class="line">Thou couldst not say this was my Elnor's face.</div>
<div class="line">Like a foul Gorgon, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
<a href="#note1645">[1645]</a><q>It hinders concoction, refrigerates the heart, takes away stomach,
colour, and sleep, thickens the blood,</q> (<a href="#note1646">[1646]</a>Fernelius, <span class="cite">l. 1. c. 18.
de morb. causis</span>,) <q>contaminates the spirits.</q> (<a href="#note1647">[1647]</a>Piso.) Overthrows
the natural heat, perverts the good estate of body and mind, and makes them
weary of their lives, cry out, howl and roar for very anguish of their
souls. David confessed as much, <span class="bibcite">Psalm xxxviii. 8</span>, <q>I have roared for the
very disquietness of my heart.</q> And <span class="bibcite">Psalm cxix. 4, part 4 v</span>. <q>My soul
melteth away for very heaviness,</q> <span class="bibcite">v. 38</span>. <q>I am like a bottle in the smoke.</q>
Antiochus complained that he could not sleep, and that his heart fainted
for grief, <a href="#note1648">[1648]</a>Christ himself, <span lang="la">vir dolorum</span>, out of an apprehension of
grief, did sweat blood, <span class="bibcite">Mark xiv.</span> <q>His soul was heavy to the death, and no
sorrow was like unto his.</q> Crato, <span class="cite">consil. 24. l. 2</span>, gives instance in
one that was so melancholy by reason of <a href="#note1649">[1649]</a>grief; and Montanus,
<span class="cite">consil. 30</span>, in a noble matron, <a href="#note1650">[1650]</a><q>that had no other cause of this
mischief.</q> I. S. D. in Hildesheim, fully cured a patient of his that was
much troubled with melancholy, and for many years, <a href="#note1651">[1651]</a><q>but afterwards,
by a little occasion of sorrow, he fell into his former fits, and was
tormented as before.</q> Examples are common, how it causeth melancholy,
<a href="#note1652">[1652]</a>desperation, and sometimes death itself; for (<span class="bibcite">Eccles. xxxviii. 15</span>,)
<q>Of heaviness comes death; worldly sorrow causeth death.</q> <span class="bibcite">2 Cor. vii. 10</span>,
<span class="bibcite">Psalm xxxi. 10</span>, <q>My life is wasted with heaviness, and my years with
mourning.</q> Why was Hecuba said to be turned to a dog? Niobe into a stone?
but that for grief she was senseless and stupid. Severus the Emperor <a href="#note1653">[1653]</a>
died for grief; and how <a href="#note1654">[1654]</a>many myriads besides? <span lang="la">Tanta illi est
feritas, tanta est insania luctus</span>. <a href="#note1655">[1655]</a>Melancthon gives a reason of it,
<a href="#note1656">[1656]</a><q>the gathering of much melancholy blood about the heart, which
collection extinguisheth the good spirits, or at least dulleth them, sorrow
strikes the heart, makes it tremble and pine away, with great pain; and the
black blood drawn from the spleen, and diffused under the ribs, on the left
side, makes those perilous hypochondriacal convulsions, which happen to
them that are troubled with sorrow.</q>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.3.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Fear, a Cause</i>.</h4>

<p>Cousin german to sorrow, is fear, or rather a sister, <span lang="la">fidus Achates</span>, and
continual companion, an assistant and a principal agent in procuring of
this mischief; a cause and symptom as the other. In a word, as <a href="#note1657">[1657]</a>
Virgil of the Harpies, I may justly say of them both,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Tristius haud illis monstrum, nec saevior ulla</div>
<div class="line">Pestis et ira Deum stygiis sese extulit undis.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">A sadder monster, or more cruel plague so fell,</div>
<div class="line">Or vengeance of the gods, ne'er came from Styx or Hell.</div>
</div>
This foul fiend of fear was worshipped heretofore as a god by the
Lacedaemonians, and most of those other torturing <a href="#note1658">[1658]</a>affections, and so
was sorrow amongst the rest, under the name of Angerona Dea, they stood in
such awe of them, as Austin, <span class="cite">de Civitat. Dei, lib. 4. cap. 8</span>, noteth
out of Varro, fear was commonly <a href="#note1659">[1659]</a>adored and painted in their temples
with a lion's head; and as Macrobius records, <span class="cite">l. 10. Saturnalium</span>;
<a href="#note1660">[1660]</a><q>In the calends of January, Angerona had her holy day, to whom in
the temple of Volupia, or goddess of pleasure, their augurs and bishops did
yearly sacrifice; that, being propitious to them, she might expel all
cares, anguish, and vexation of the mind for that year following.</q> Many
lamentable effects this fear causeth in men, as to be red, pale, tremble,
sweat, <a href="#note1661">[1661]</a>it makes sudden cold and heat to come over all the body,
palpitation of the heart, syncope, &amp;c. It amazeth many men that are to
speak, or show themselves in public assemblies, or before some great
personages, as Tully confessed of himself, that he trembled still at the
beginning of his speech; and Demosthenes, that great orator of Greece,
before Philippus. It confounds voice and memory, as Lucian wittily brings
in Jupiter Tragoedus, so much afraid of his auditory, when he was to make a
speech to the rest of the Gods, that he could not utter a ready word, but
was compelled to use Mercury's help in prompting. Many men are so amazed
and astonished with fear, they know not where they are, what they say,
<a href="#note1662">[1662]</a>what they do, and that which is worst, it tortures them many days
before with continual affrights and suspicion. It hinders most honourable
attempts, and makes their hearts ache, sad and heavy. They that live in
fear are never free, <a href="#note1663">[1663]</a>resolute, secure, never merry, but in continual
pain: that, as Vives truly said, <span lang="la">Nulla est miseria major quam metus</span>, no
greater misery, no rack, nor torture like unto it, ever suspicious,
anxious, solicitous, they are childishly drooping without reason, without
judgment, <a href="#note1664">[1664]</a><q>especially if some terrible object be offered,</q> as
Plutarch hath it. It causeth oftentimes sudden madness, and almost all
manner of diseases, as I have sufficiently illustrated in my <a href="#note1665">[1665]</a>
digression of the force of imagination, and shall do more at large in my
section of <a href="#note1666">[1666]</a>terrors. Fear makes our imagination conceive what it
list, invites the devil to come to us, as <a href="#note1667">[1667]</a>Agrippa and Cardan avouch,
and tyranniseth over our phantasy more than all other affections,
especially in the dark. We see this verified in most men, as <a href="#note1668">[1668]</a>Lavater
saith, <span lang="la">Quae metuunt, fingunt</span>; what they fear they conceive, and feign
unto themselves; they think they see goblins, hags, devils, and many times
become melancholy thereby. Cardan, <span class="cite">subtil. lib. 18</span>, hath an example of
such an one, so caused to be melancholy (by sight of a bugbear) all his
life after. Augustus Caesar durst not sit in the dark, <span lang="la">nisi aliquo
assidente</span>, saith <a href="#note1669">[1669]</a>Suetonius, <span lang="la">Nunquam tenebris exigilavit</span>. And 'tis
strange what women and children will conceive unto themselves, if they go
over a churchyard in the night, lie, or be alone in a dark room, how they
sweat and tremble on a sudden. Many men are troubled with future events,
foreknowledge of their fortunes, destinies, as Severus the Emperor, Adrian
and Domitian, <span lang="la">Quod sciret ultimum vitae diem</span>, saith Suetonius, <span lang="la">valde
solicitus</span>, much tortured in mind because he foreknew his end; with many
such, of which I shall speak more opportunely in another place.<a href="#note1670">[1670]</a>
Anxiety, mercy, pity, indignation, &amp;c., and such fearful branches derived
from these two stems of fear and sorrow, I voluntarily omit; read more of
them in <a href="#note1671">[1671]</a>Carolus Pascalius, <a href="#note1672">[1672]</a>Dandinus, &amp;c.

<h4><a name="1.2.3.6"></a>SUBSECT. VI.&mdash;<i>Shame and Disgrace, Causes</i>.</h4>

<p>Shame and disgrace cause most violent passions and bitter pangs. <span lang="la">Ob
pudorem et dedecus publicum, ob errorum commissum saepe moventur generosi
animi</span> (Felix Plater, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de alienat mentis</span>.) Generous minds are
often moved with shame, to despair for some public disgrace. And he, saith
Philo, <span class="cite">lib. 2. de provid. dei</span>, <a href="#note1673">[1673]</a><q>that subjects himself to fear,
grief, ambition, shame, is not happy, but altogether miserable, tortured
with continual labour, care, and misery.</q> It is as forcible a batterer as
any of the rest: <a href="#note1674">[1674]</a><q>Many men neglect the tumults of the world, and
care not for glory, and yet they are afraid of infamy, repulse, disgrace,</q>
(<span class="cite">Tul. offic. l. 1</span>,) <q>they can severely contemn pleasure, bear grief
indifferently, but they are quite <a href="#note1675">[1675]</a>battered and broken, with reproach
and obloquy:</q> (<span lang="la">siquidem vita et fama pari passu ambulant</span>) and are so
dejected many times for some public injury, disgrace, as a box on the ear
by their inferior, to be overcome of their adversary, foiled in the field,
to be out in a speech, some foul fact committed or disclosed, &amp;c. that they
dare not come abroad all their lives after, but melancholise in corners,
and keep in holes. The most generous spirits are most subject to it;
<span lang="la">Spiritus altos frangit et generosos</span>: Hieronymus. Aristotle, because he
could not understand the motion of Euripus, for grief and shame drowned
himself: Caelius Rodigimus <span class="cite">antiquar. lec. lib. 29. cap. 8.</span> <span lang="la">Homerus
pudore consumptus</span>, was swallowed up with this passion of shame <a href="#note1676">[1676]</a>
<q>because he could not unfold the fisherman's riddle.</q> Sophocles killed
himself, <a href="#note1677">[1677]</a><q>for that a tragedy of his was hissed off the stage:</q>
<span class="cite">Valer. max. lib. 9. cap. 12.</span> Lucretia stabbed herself, and so did
<a href="#note1678">[1678]</a>Cleopatra, <q>when she saw that she was reserved for a triumph, to
avoid the infamy.</q> Antonius the Roman, <a href="#note1679">[1679]</a><q>after he was overcome of his
enemy, for three days' space sat solitary in the fore-part of the ship,
abstaining from all company, even of Cleopatra herself, and afterwards for
very shame butchered himself,</q> Plutarch, <span class="cite">vita ejus</span>. Apollonius Rhodius
<a href="#note1680">[1680]</a><q>wilfully banished himself, forsaking his country, and all his dear
friends, because he was out in reciting his poems,</q> Plinius, <span class="cite">lib. 7.
cap. 23.</span> Ajax ran mad, because his arms were adjudged to Ulysses. In
China 'tis an ordinary thing for such as are excluded in those famous
trials of theirs, or should take degrees, for shame and grief to lose their
wits, <a href="#note1681">[1681]</a>Mat Riccius <span class="cite">expedit. ad Sinas, l. 3. c. 9.</span> Hostratus the
friar took that book which Reuclin had writ against him, under the name of
<span class="cite">Epist. obscurorum virorum</span>, so to heart, that for shame and grief he made
away with himself, <a href="#note1682">[1682]</a><span lang="la">Jovius in elogiis</span>. A grave and learned
minister, and an ordinary preacher at Alcmar in Holland, was (one day as he
walked in the fields for his recreation) suddenly taken with a lax or
looseness, and thereupon compelled to retire to the next ditch; but being
<a href="#note1683">[1683]</a>surprised at unawares, by some gentlewomen of his parish wandering
that way, was so abashed, that he did never after show his head in public,
or come into the pulpit, but pined away with melancholy: (Pet. Forestus
<span class="cite">med. observat. lib. 10. observat. 12.</span>) So shame amongst other passions
can play his prize.

<p>I know there be many base, impudent, brazenfaced rogues, that will <a href="#note1684">[1684]</a>
<span lang="la">Nulla pallescere culpa</span>, be moved with nothing, take no infamy or disgrace
to heart, laugh at all; let them be proved perjured, stigmatised, convict
rogues, thieves, traitors, lose their ears, be whipped, branded, carted,
pointed at, hissed, reviled, and derided with <a href="#note1685">[1685]</a>Ballio the Bawd in

Yet a modest man, one that hath grace, a generous spirit, tender of his

that he had rather give myriads of crowns, lose his life, than suffer the

cannot avoid it, as a nightingale, <span lang="la">Que cantando victa moritur</span>, (saith

He tortures himself if his equal, friend, neighbour, be preferred,
commended, do well; if he understand of it, it galls him afresh; and no
greater pain can come to him than to hear of another man's well-doing; 'tis
a dagger at his heart every such object. He looks at him as they that fell
down in Lucian's rock of honour, with an envious eye, and will damage
himself, to do another a mischief: <span lang="la">Atque cadet subito, dum super hoste

<p>Out of this root of envy <a href="#note1711">[1711]</a>spring those feral branches of faction,
hatred, livor, emulation, which cause the like grievances, and are, <span lang="la">serrae
animae</span>, the saws of the soul, <a href="#note1712">[1712]</a><span lang="la">consternationis pleni affectus</span>,
affections full of desperate amazement; or as Cyprian describes emulation,
it is <a href="#note1713">[1713]</a><q>a moth of the soul, a consumption, to make another man's
happiness his misery, to torture, crucify, and execute himself, to eat his
own heart. Meat and drink can do such men no good, they do always grieve,
sigh, and groan, day and night without intermission, their breast is torn
asunder:</q> and a little after, <a href="#note1714">[1714]</a><q>Whomsoever he is whom thou dost
emulate and envy, he may avoid thee, but thou canst neither avoid him nor
thyself; wheresoever thou art he is with thee, thine enemy is ever in thy
breast, thy destruction is within thee, thou art a captive, bound hand and
foot, as long as thou art malicious and envious, and canst not be
comforted. It was the devil's overthrow;</q> and whensoever thou art
thoroughly affected with this passion, it will be thine. Yet no
perturbation so frequent, no passion so common.

<p>Every society, corporation, and private family is full of it, it takes hold
almost of all sorts of men, from the prince to the ploughman, even amongst
gossips it is to be seen, scarce three in a company but there is siding,
faction, emulation, between two of them, some <span lang="la">simultas</span>, jar, private
grudge, heart-burning in the midst of them. Scarce two gentlemen dwell
together in the country, (if they be not near kin or linked in marriage)
but there is emulation betwixt them and their servants, some quarrel or
some grudge betwixt their wives or children, friends and followers, some
contention about wealth, gentry, precedency, &amp;c., by means of which, like
the frog in <a href="#note1716">[1716]</a>Aesop, <q>that would swell till she was as big as an ox,
burst herself at last;</q> they will stretch beyond their fortunes, callings,
and strive so long that they consume their substance in lawsuits, or
otherwise in hospitality, feasting, fine clothes, to get a few bombast
titles, for <span lang="la">ambitiosa paupertate laboramus omnes</span>, to outbrave one
another, they will tire their bodies, macerate their souls, and through
contentions or mutual invitations beggar themselves. Scarce two great
scholars in an age, but with bitter invectives they fall foul one on the
other, and their adherents; Scotists, Thomists, Reals, Nominals, Plato and
Aristotle, Galenists and Paracelsians, &amp;c., it holds in all professions.

<p>Honest <a href="#note1717">[1717]</a>emulation in studies, in all callings is not to be
disliked, 'tis <span lang="la">ingeniorum cos</span>, as one calls it, the whetstone of wit, the
nurse of wit and valour, and those noble Romans out of this spirit did
brave exploits. There is a modest ambition, as Themistocles was roused up
with the glory of Miltiades; Achilles' trophies moved Alexander,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1718">[1718]</a>Ambire semper stulta confidentia est,</div>
<div class="line">Ambire nunquam deses arrogantia est.</div>
</div>
'Tis a sluggish humour not to emulate or to sue at all, to withdraw
himself, neglect, refrain from such places, honours, offices, through
sloth, niggardliness, fear, bashfulness, or otherwise, to which by his
birth, place, fortunes, education, he is called, apt, fit, and well able to
undergo; but when it is immoderate, it is a plague and a miserable pain.
What a deal of money did Henry VIII. and Francis I. king of France, spend
at that <a href="#note1719">[1719]</a>famous interview? and how many vain courtiers, seeking each
to outbrave other, spent themselves, their livelihood and fortunes, and
died beggars? <a href="#note1720">[1720]</a>Adrian the Emperor was so galled with it, that he
killed all his equals; so did Nero. This passion made <a href="#note1721">[1721]</a>Dionysius the
tyrant banish Plato and Philoxenus the poet, because they did excel and
eclipse his glory, as he thought; the Romans exile Coriolanus, confine
Camillus, murder Scipio; the Greeks by ostracism to expel Aristides,
Nicias, Alcibiades, imprison Theseus, make away Phocion, &amp;c. When Richard
I. and Philip of France were fellow soldiers together, at the siege of Acon
in the Holy Land, and Richard had approved himself to be the more valiant
man, insomuch that all men's eyes were upon him, it so galled Philip,
<span lang="la">Francum urebat Regis victoria</span>, saith mine <a href="#note1722">[1722]</a>author, <span lang="la">tam aegre
ferebat Richardi gloriam, ut carpere dicta, calumniari facta</span>; that he
cavilled at all his proceedings, and fell at length to open defiance; he
could contain no longer, but hasting home, invaded his territories, and
professed open war. <q>Hatred stirs up contention,</q> <span class="bibcite">Prov. x. 12</span>, and they
break out at last into immortal enmity, into virulency, and more than
Vatinian hate and rage; <a href="#note1723">[1723]</a>they persecute each other, their friends,
followers, and all their posterity, with bitter taunts, hostile wars,
scurrile invectives, libels, calumnies, fire, sword, and the like, and will
not be reconciled. Witness that Guelph and Ghibelline faction in Italy;
that of the Adurni and Fregosi in Genoa; that of Cneius Papirius, and
Quintus Fabius in Rome; Caesar and Pompey; Orleans and Burgundy in France;
York and Lancaster in England: yea, this passion so rageth<a href="#note1724">[1724]</a>many
times, that it subverts not men only, and families, but even populous
cities. <a href="#note1725">[1725]</a>Carthage and Corinth can witness as much, nay, flourishing
kingdoms are brought into a wilderness by it. This hatred, malice, faction,
and desire of revenge, invented first all those racks and wheels,
strappadoes, brazen bulls, feral engines, prisons, inquisitions, severe
laws to macerate and torment one another. How happy might we be, and end
our time with blessed days and sweet content, if we could contain
ourselves, and, as we ought to do, put up injuries, learn humility,
meekness, patience, forget and forgive, as in <a href="#note1726">[1726]</a>God's word we are
enjoined, compose such final controversies amongst ourselves, moderate our
passions in this kind, <q>and think better of others,</q> as <a href="#note1727">[1727]</a>Paul would
have us, <q>than of ourselves: be of like affection one towards another, and
not avenge ourselves, but have peace with all men.</q> But being that we are
so peevish and perverse, insolent and proud, so factious and seditious, so
malicious and envious; we do <span lang="la">invicem angariare</span>, maul and vex one another,
torture, disquiet, and precipitate ourselves into that gulf of woes and
cares, aggravate our misery and melancholy, heap upon us hell and eternal
damnation.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.3.9"></a>SUBSECT. IX.&mdash;<i>Anger, a Cause</i>.</h4>

<p>Anger, a perturbation, which carries the spirits outwards, preparing the
body to melancholy, and madness itself: <span lang="la">Ira furor brevis est</span>, <q>anger is
temporary madness;</q> and as <a href="#note1728">[1728]</a>Picolomineus accounts it, one of the
three most violent passions. <a href="#note1729">[1729]</a>Areteus sets it down for an especial
cause (so doth Seneca, <span class="cite">ep. 18. l. 1</span>,) of this malady. <a href="#note1730">[1730]</a>Magninus
gives the reason, <span lang="la">Ex frequenti ira supra modum calefiunt</span>; it overheats
their bodies, and if it be too frequent, it breaks out into manifest
madness, saith St. Ambrose. 'Tis a known saying, <span lang="la">Furor fit Iaesa saepius
palienlia</span>, the most patient spirit that is, if he be often provoked, will
be incensed to madness; it will make a devil of a saint: and therefore
Basil (belike) in his Homily <span class="cite">de Ira</span>, calls it <span lang="la">tenebras rationis, morbum
animae, et daemonem pessimum</span>; the darkening of our understanding, and a bad
angel. <a href="#note1731">[1731]</a>Lucian, <span class="cite">in Abdicato, tom. 1</span>, will have this passion to work
this effect, especially in old men and women. <q>Anger and calumny</q> (saith he)
<q>trouble them at first, and after a while break out into madness: many
things cause fury in women, especially if they love or hate overmuch, or
envy, be much grieved or angry; these things by little and little lead them
on to this malady.</q> From a disposition they proceed to an habit, for there
is no difference between a mad man, and an angry man, in the time of his
fit; anger, as Lactantius describes it, <span class="cite">L. de Ira Dei, ad Donatum, c. 5</span>,
is <a href="#note1732">[1732]</a><span lang="la">saeva animi tempestas</span>, &amp;c., a cruel tempest of the mind; <q>making
his eye sparkle fire, and stare, teeth gnash in his head, his tongue
stutter, his face pale, or red, and what more filthy imitation can be of a
mad man?</q>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1733">[1733]</a>Ora tument ira, fervescunt sanguine venae,</div>
<div class="line">Lumina Gorgonio saevius angue micant.</div>
</div>
They are void of reason, inexorable, blind, like beasts and monsters for
the time, say and do they know not what, curse, swear, rail, fight, and
what not? How can a mad man do more? as he said in the comedy, <a href="#note1734">[1734]</a>
<span lang="la">Iracundia non sum apud me</span>, I am not mine own man. If these fits be
immoderate, continue long, or be frequent, without doubt they provoke
madness. Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 21</span>, had a melancholy Jew to his patient, he
ascribes this for a principal cause: <span lang="la">Irascebatur levibus de causis</span>, he
was easily moved to anger. Ajax had no other beginning of his madness; and
Charles the Sixth, that lunatic French king, fell into this misery, out of
the extremity of his passion, desire of revenge and malice, <a href="#note1735">[1735]</a>incensed
against the duke of Britain, he could neither eat, drink, nor sleep for
some days together, and in the end, about the calends of July, 1392, he
became mad upon his horseback, drawing his sword, striking such as came
near him promiscuously, and so continued all the days of his life, Aemil.,
<span class="cite">lib. 10.</span> Gal. <span class="cite">hist.</span> Aegesippus <span class="cite">de exid. urbis Hieros, l. 1. c. 37</span>, hath
such a story of Herod, that out of an angry fit, became mad, <a href="#note1736">[1736]</a>leaping
out of his bed, he killed Jossippus, and played many such bedlam pranks,
the whole court could not rule him for a long time after: sometimes he was
sorry and repented, much grieved for that he had done, <span lang="la">Postquam deferbuit
ira</span>, by and by outrageous again. In hot choleric bodies, nothing so soon
causeth madness, as this passion of anger, besides many other diseases, as
Pelesius observes, <span class="cite">cap. 21. l. 1. de hum. affect. causis</span>; <span lang="la">Sanguinem
imminuit, fel auget</span>: and as <a href="#note1737">[1737]</a>Valesius controverts, <span class="cite">Med. controv.,
lib. 5. contro. 8</span>, many times kills them quite out. If this were the
worst of this passion, it were more tolerable, <a href="#note1738">[1738]</a><q>but it ruins and
subverts whole towns, <a href="#note1739">[1739]</a>cities, families, and kingdoms;</q> <span lang="la">Nulla pestis
humano generi pluris stetit</span>, saith Seneca, <span class="cite">de Ira, lib. 1.</span> No plague
hath done mankind so much harm. Look into our histories, and you shall
almost meet with no other subject, but what a company <a href="#note1740">[1740]</a>of harebrains
have done in their rage. We may do well therefore to put this in our
procession amongst the rest; <q>From all blindness of heart, from pride,
vainglory, and hypocrisy, from envy, hatred and malice, anger, and all
such pestiferous perturbations, good Lord deliver us.</q>

<h4><a name="1.2.3.10"></a>SUBSECT. X.&mdash;<i>Discontents, Cares, Miseries, &amp;c. Causes</i>.</h4>

<p>Discontents, cares, crosses, miseries, or whatsoever it is, that shall
cause any molestation of spirits, grief, anguish, and perplexity, may well
be reduced to this head, (preposterously placed here in some men's
judgments they may seem,) yet in that Aristotle in his <a href="#note1741">[1741]</a>Rhetoric
defines these cares, as he doth envy, emulation, &amp;c. still by grief, I
think I may well rank them in this irascible row; being that they are as
the rest, both causes and symptoms of this disease, producing the like
inconveniences, and are most part accompanied with anguish and pain. The
common etymology will evince it, <span lang="la">Cura quasi cor uro, Dementes curae,
insomnes curae, damnosae curae, tristes, mordaces, carnifices</span>, &amp;c. biting,
eating, gnawing, cruel, bitter, sick, sad, unquiet, pale, tetric,
miserable, intolerable cares, as the poets <a href="#note1742">[1742]</a>call them, worldly cares,
and are as many in number as the sea sands. <a href="#note1743">[1743]</a>Galen, Fernelius, Felix
Plater, Valescus de Taranta, &amp;c., reckon afflictions, miseries, even all
these contentions, and vexations of the mind, as principal causes, in that
they take away sleep, hinder concoction, dry up the body, and consume the
substance of it. They are not so many in number, but their causes be as
divers, and not one of a thousand free from them, or that can vindicate
himself, whom that <span lang="la">Ate dea</span>,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1744">[1744]</a>Per hominum capita molliter ambulans,</div>
<div class="line">Plantas pedum teneras habens:</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Over men's heads walking aloft,</div>
<div class="line">With tender feet treading so soft,</div>
</div>
<p>Homer's Goddess Ate hath not involved into this discontented <a href="#note1745">[1745]</a>rank,
or plagued with some misery or other. Hyginus, <span class="cite">fab. 220</span>, to this purpose
hath a pleasant tale. Dame Cura by chance went over a brook, and taking up
some of the dirty slime, made an image of it; Jupiter eftsoons coming by,
put life to it, but Cura and Jupiter could not agree what name to give him,
or who should own him; the matter was referred to Saturn as judge; he gave
this arbitrement: his name shall be <span lang="la">Homo ab humo, Cura eum possideat
quamdiu vivat</span>, Care shall have him whilst he lives, Jupiter his soul, and
Tellus his body when he dies. But to leave tales. A general cause, a
continuate cause, an inseparable accident, to all men, is discontent, care,
misery; were there no other particular affliction (which who is free from?)
to molest a man in this life, the very cogitation of that common misery
were enough to macerate, and make him weary of his life; to think that he
can never be secure, but still in danger, sorrow, grief, and persecution.
For to begin at the hour of his birth, as <a href="#note1746">[1746]</a>Pliny doth elegantly
describe it, <q>he is born naked, and falls <a href="#note1747">[1747]</a>a whining at the very
first: he is swaddled, and bound up like a prisoner, cannot help himself,
and so he continues to his life's end.</q> <span lang="la">Cujusque ferae pabulum</span>, saith
<a href="#note1748">[1748]</a>Seneca, impatient of heat and cold, impatient of labour, impatient
of idleness, exposed to fortune's contumelies. To a naked mariner Lucretius
compares him, cast on shore by shipwreck, cold and comfortless in an
unknown land: <a href="#note1749">[1749]</a>no estate, age, sex, can secure himself from this
common misery. <q>A man that is born of a woman is of short continuance, and
full of trouble,</q> <span class="bibcite">Job xiv. 1, 22</span>. <q>And while his flesh is upon him he shall
be sorrowful, and while his soul is in him it shall mourn. All his days are
sorrow and his travels griefs: his heart also taketh not rest in the
night.</q> <span class="bibcite">Eccles. ii. 23, and ii. 11</span>. <q>All that is in it is sorrow and
vexation of spirit. <a href="#note1750">[1750]</a>Ingress, progress, regress, egress, much alike:
blindness seizeth on us in the beginning, labour in the middle, grief in
the end, error in all. What day ariseth to us without some grief, care, or
anguish? Or what so secure and pleasing a morning have we seen, that hath
not been overcast before the evening?</q> One is miserable, another
ridiculous, a third odious. One complains of this grievance, another of
that. <span lang="la">Aliquando nervi, aliquando pedes vexant</span>, (Seneca) <span lang="la">nunc
distillatio, nunc epatis morbus; nunc deest, nunc superest sanguis</span>: now
the head aches, then the feet, now the lungs, then the liver, &amp;c. <span lang="la">Huic
sensus exuberat, sed est pudori degener sanguis</span>, &amp;c. He is rich, but base
born; he is noble, but poor; a third hath means, but he wants health
peradventure, or wit to manage his estate; children vex one, wife a second,
&amp;c. <span lang="la">Nemo facile cum conditione sua concordat</span>, no man is pleased with his
fortune, a pound of sorrow is familiarly mixed with a dram of content,
little or no joy, little comfort, but <a href="#note1751">[1751]</a>everywhere danger, contention,
anxiety, in all places: go where thou wilt, and thou shalt find
discontents, cares, woes, complaints, sickness, diseases, encumbrances,
exclamations: <q>If thou look into the market, there</q> (saith <a href="#note1752">[1752]</a>
Chrysostom) <q>is brawling and contention; if to the court, there knavery and
flattery, &amp;c.; if to a private man's house, there's cark and care,
heaviness,</q> &amp;c. As he said of old,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1753">[1753]</a>Nil homine in terra spirat miserum magis alma?</div>
</div>
No creature so miserable as man, so generally
molested, <a href="#note1754">[1754]</a><q>in miseries of body, in miseries of mind, miseries of
heart, in miseries asleep, in miseries awake, in miseries wheresoever he
turns,</q> as Bernard found, <span lang="la">Nunquid tentatio est vita humana super terram</span>?
A mere temptation is our life, (Austin, <span class="cite">confess. lib. 10. cap. 28</span>,)
<span lang="la">catena perpetuorum malorum, et quis potest molestias et difficultates
pati</span>? Who can endure the miseries of it? <a href="#note1755">[1755]</a><q>In prosperity we are
insolent and intolerable, dejected in adversity, in all fortunes foolish
and miserable.</q> <a href="#note1756">[1756]</a><q>In adversity I wish for prosperity, and in prosperity
I am afraid of adversity. What mediocrity may be found? Where is no
temptation? What condition of life is free?</q> <a href="#note1757">[1757]</a><q>Wisdom hath labour
annexed to it, glory, envy; riches and cares, children and encumbrances,
pleasure and diseases, rest and beggary, go together: as if a man were
therefore born</q> (as the Platonists hold) <q>to be punished in this life for
some precedent sins.</q> Or that, as <a href="#note1758">[1758]</a>Pliny complains, <q>Nature may be
rather accounted a stepmother, than a mother unto us, all things
considered: no creature's life so brittle, so full of fear, so mad, so
furious; only man is plagued with envy, discontent, griefs, covetousness,
ambition, superstition.</q> Our whole life is an Irish sea, wherein there is
nought to be expected but tempestuous storms and troublesome waves, and
those infinite,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1759">[1759]</a>Tantum malorum pelagus aspicio,</div>
<div class="line">Ut non sit inde enatandi copia,</div>
</div>
no halcyonian times, wherein a man can hold himself secure, or agree with
his present estate; but as Boethius infers, <a href="#note1760">[1760]</a><q>there is something in
every one of us which before trial we seek, and having tried abhor: <a href="#note1761">[1761]</a>
we earnestly wish, and eagerly covet, and are eftsoons weary of it.</q> Thus
between hope and fear, suspicions, angers, <a href="#note1762">[1762]</a><span lang="la">Inter spemque metumque, timores inter et iras</span>,
betwixt falling in, falling out, &amp;c., we bangle
away our best days, befool out our times, we lead a contentious,
discontent, tumultuous, melancholy, miserable life; insomuch, that if we
could foretell what was to come, and it put to our choice, we should rather
refuse than accept of this painful life. In a word, the world itself is a
maze, a labyrinth of errors, a desert, a wilderness, a den of thieves,
cheaters, &amp;c., full of filthy puddles, horrid rocks, precipitiums, an ocean
of adversity, an heavy yoke, wherein infirmities and calamities overtake,
and follow one another, as the sea waves; and if we scape Scylla, we fall
foul on Charybdis, and so in perpetual fear, labour, anguish, we run from
one plague, one mischief, one burden to another, <span lang="la">duram servientes
servitutem</span>, and you may as soon separate weight from lead, heat from fire,
moistness from water, brightness from the sun, as misery, discontent, care,
calamity, danger, from a man. Our towns and cities are but so many
dwellings of human misery. <q>In which grief and sorrow</q> (<a href="#note1763">[1763]</a>as he right
well observes out of Solon) <q>innumerable troubles, labours of mortal men,
and all manner of vices, are included, as in so many pens.</q> Our villages
are like molehills, and men as so many emmets, busy, busy still, going to
and fro, in and out, and crossing one another's projects, as the lines of
several sea-cards cut each other in a globe or map. <q>Now light and merry,</q>
but (<a href="#note1764">[1764]</a>as one follows it) <q>by-and-by sorrowful and heavy; now hoping,
then distrusting; now patient, tomorrow crying out; now pale, then red;
running, sitting, sweating, trembling, halting,</q> &amp;c. Some few amongst the
rest, or perhaps one of a thousand, may be Pullus Jovis, in the world's
esteem, <span lang="la">Gallinae filius albae</span>, an happy and fortunate man, <span lang="la">ad invidiam
felix</span>, because rich, fair, well allied, in honour and office; yet
peradventure ask himself, and he will say, that of all others <a href="#note1765">[1765]</a>he is
most miserable and unhappy. A fair shoe, <span lang="la">Hic soccus novus, elegans</span>, as he
<a href="#note1766">[1766]</a>said, <span lang="la">sed nescis ubi urat</span>, but thou knowest not where it pincheth.
It is not another man's opinion can make me happy: but as <a href="#note1767">[1767]</a>Seneca
well hath it, <q>He is a miserable wretch that doth not account himself
happy, though he be sovereign lord of a world: he is not happy, if he think
himself not to be so; for what availeth it what thine estate is, or seem to
others, if thou thyself dislike it?</q> A common humour it is of all men to
think well of other men's fortunes, and dislike their own: <a href="#note1768">[1768]</a><span lang="la">Cui
placet alterius, sua nimirum est odio sors</span>; but <a href="#note1769">[1769]</a><span lang="la">qui fit Mecoenas</span>,
&amp;c., how comes it to pass, what's the cause of it? Many men are of such a
perverse nature, they are well pleased with nothing, (saith <a href="#note1770">[1770]</a>
Theodoret,) <q>neither with riches nor poverty, they complain when they are
well and when they are sick, grumble at all fortunes, prosperity and
adversity; they are troubled in a cheap year, in a barren, plenty or not
plenty, nothing pleaseth them, war nor peace, with children, nor without.</q>
This for the most part is the humour of us all, to be discontent,
miserable, and most unhappy, as we think at least; and show me him that is
not so, or that ever was otherwise. Quintus Metellus his felicity is
infinitely admired amongst the Romans, insomuch that as <a href="#note1771">[1771]</a>Paterculus
mentioneth of him, you can scarce find of any nation, order, age, sex, one
for happiness to be compared unto him: he had, in a word, <span lang="la">Bona animi,
corporis et fortunae</span>, goods of mind, body, and fortune, so had P.
Mutianus, <a href="#note1772">[1772]</a>Crassus. Lampsaca, that Lacedaemonian lady, was such
another in <a href="#note1773">[1773]</a>Pliny's conceit, a king's wife, a king's mother, a king's
daughter: and all the world esteemed as much of Polycrates of Samos. The
Greeks brag of their Socrates, Phocion, Aristides; the Psophidians in
particular of their Aglaus, <span lang="la">Omni vita felix, ab omni periculo immunis</span>
(which by the way Pausanias held impossible;) the Romans of their <a href="#note1774">[1774]</a>
Cato, Curius, Fabricius, for their composed fortunes, and retired estates,
government of passions, and contempt of the world: yet none of all these
were happy, or free from discontent, neither Metellus, Crassus, nor
Polycrates, for he died a violent death, and so did Cato; and how much evil
doth Lactantius and Theodoret speak of Socrates, a weak man, and so of the
rest. There is no content in this life, but as <a href="#note1775">[1775]</a>he said, <q>All is
vanity and vexation of spirit;</q> lame and imperfect. Hadst thou Sampson's
hair, Milo's strength, Scanderbeg's arm, Solomon's wisdom, Absalom's
beauty, Croesus' wealth, <span lang="la">Pasetis obulum</span>, Caesar's valour, Alexander's
spirit, Tully's or Demosthenes' eloquence, Gyges' ring, Perseus' Pegasus,
and Gorgon's head, Nestor's years to come, all this would not make thee
absolute; give thee content, and true happiness in this life, or so
continue it. Even in the midst of all our mirth, jollity, and laughter, is
sorrow and grief, or if there be true happiness amongst us, 'tis but for a
time,

triumph, as Caesar into Rome, Alcibiades into Athens, <span lang="la">coronis aureis

He that erst marched like Xerxes with innumerable armies, as rich as
Croesus, now shifts for himself in a poor cock-boat, is bound in iron
chains, with Bajazet the Turk, and a footstool with Aurelian, for a
tyrannising conqueror to trample on. So many casualties there are, that as
Seneca said of a city consumed with fire, <span lang="la">Una dies interest inter maximum
civitatem et nullam</span>, one day betwixt a great city and none: so many
grievances from outward accidents, and from ourselves, our own
indiscretion, inordinate appetite, one day betwixt a man and no man. And
which is worse, as if discontents and miseries would not come fast enough
upon us: <span lang="la">homo homini daemon</span>, we maul, persecute, and study how to sting,
gall, and vex one another with mutual hatred, abuses, injuries; preying
upon and devouring as so many, <a href="#note1780">[1780]</a>ravenous birds; and as jugglers,
panders, bawds, cozening one another; or raging as <a href="#note1781">[1781]</a>wolves, tigers,
and devils, we take a delight to torment one another; men are evil, wicked,
malicious, treacherous, and <a href="#note1782">[1782]</a>naught, not loving one another, or
loving themselves, not hospitable, charitable, nor sociable as they ought
to be, but counterfeit, dissemblers, ambidexters, all for their own ends,
hard-hearted, merciless, pitiless, and to benefit themselves, they care not
what mischief they procure to others. <a href="#note1783">[1783]</a>Praxinoe and Gorgo in the
poet, when they had got in to see those costly sights, they then cried
<span lang="la">bene est</span>, and would thrust out all the rest: when they are rich
themselves, in honour, preferred, full, and have even that they would, they
debar others of those pleasures which youth requires, and they formerly
have enjoyed. He sits at table in a soft chair at ease, but he doth
remember in the mean time that a tired waiter stands behind him, <q>an hungry
fellow ministers to him full, he is athirst that gives him drink</q> (saith
<a href="#note1784">[1784]</a>Epictetus) <q>and is silent whilst he speaks his pleasure: pensive,
sad, when he laughs.</q> <span lang="la">Pleno se proluit auro</span>: he feasts, revels, and
profusely spends, hath variety of robes, sweet music, ease, and all the
pleasure the world can afford, whilst many an hunger-starved poor creature
pines in the street, wants clothes to cover him, labours hard all day long,
runs, rides for a trifle, fights peradventure from sun to sun, sick and
ill, weary, full of pain and grief, is in great distress and sorrow of
heart. He loathes and scorns his inferior, hates or emulates his equal,
envies his superior, insults over all such as are under him, as if he were
of another species, a demigod, not subject to any fall, or human
infirmities. Generally they love not, are not beloved again: they tire out
others' bodies with continual labour, they themselves living at ease,
caring for none else, <span lang="la">sibi nati</span>; and are so far many times from putting
to their helping hand, that they seek all means to depress, even most
worthy and well deserving, better than themselves, those whom they are by
the laws of nature bound to relieve and help, as much as in them lies, they
will let them caterwaul, starve, beg, and hang, before they will any ways
(though it be in their power) assist or ease: <a href="#note1785">[1785]</a>so unnatural are they
for the most part, so unregardful; so hard-hearted, so churlish, proud,
insolent, so dogged, of so bad a disposition. And being so brutish, so
devilishly bent one towards another, how is it possible but that we should
be discontent of all sides, full of cares, woes, and miseries?

<p>If this be not a sufficient proof of their discontent and misery, examine
every condition and calling apart. Kings, princes, monarchs, and
magistrates seem to be most happy, but look into their estate, you shall
<a href="#note1786">[1786]</a>find them to be most encumbered with cares, in perpetual fear,
agony, suspicion, jealousy: that, as <a href="#note1787">[1787]</a>he said of a crown, if they
knew but the discontents that accompany it, they would not stoop to take it
up. <span lang="la">Quem mihi regent dabis</span> (saith Chrysostom) <span lang="la">non curis plenum</span>? What
king canst thou show me, not full of cares? <a href="#note1788">[1788]</a><q>Look not on his crown,
but consider his afflictions; attend not his number of servants, but
multitude of crosses.</q> <span lang="la">Nihil aliud potestas culminis, quam tempestas
mentis</span>, as Gregory seconds him; sovereignty is a tempest of the soul:
Sylla like they have brave titles, but terrible fits: <span lang="la">splendorem titulo,
cruciatum animo</span>: which made <a href="#note1789">[1789]</a>Demosthenes vow, <span lang="la">si vel ad tribunal,
vel ad interitum duceretur</span>: if to be a judge, or to be condemned, were put
to his choice, he would be condemned. Rich men are in the same predicament;
what their pains are, <span lang="la">stulti nesciunt, ipsi sentiunt</span>: they feel, fools
perceive not, as I shall prove elsewhere, and their wealth is brittle, like
children's rattles: they come and go, there is no certainty in them: those
whom they elevate, they do as suddenly depress, and leave in a vale of
misery. The middle sort of men are as so many asses to bear burdens; or if
they be free, and live at ease, they spend themselves, and consume their
bodies and fortunes with luxury and riot, contention, emulation, &amp;c. The
poor I reserve for another <a href="#note1790">[1790]</a>place and their discontents.

<p>For particular professions, I hold as of the rest, there's no content or
security in any; on what course will you pitch, how resolve? to be a
divine, 'tis contemptible in the world's esteem; to be a lawyer, 'tis to be
a wrangler; to be a physician, <a href="#note1791">[1791]</a><span lang="la">pudet lotii</span>, 'tis loathed; a
philosopher, a madman; an alchemist, a beggar; a poet, <span lang="la">esurit</span>, an hungry
jack; a musician, a player; a schoolmaster, a drudge; an husbandman, an
emmet; a merchant, his gains are uncertain; a mechanician, base; a
chirurgeon, fulsome; a tradesman, a <a href="#note1792">[1792]</a>liar; a tailor, a thief; a
serving-man, a slave; a soldier, a butcher; a smith, or a metalman, the
pot's never from his nose; a courtier a parasite, as he could find no tree
in the wood to hang himself; I can show no state of life to give content.
The like you may say of all ages; children live in a perpetual slavery,
still under that tyrannical government of masters; young men, and of riper
years, subject to labour, and a thousand cares of the world, to treachery,
falsehood, and cozenage,

to abandon the world, as Timon did; creep into caves and holes, as our

<h4><a name="1.2.3.11"></a>SUBSECT. XI.&mdash;<i>Concupiscible Appetite, as Desires, Ambition, Causes</i>.</h4>

<p>These concupiscible and irascible appetites are as the two twists of a
rope, mutually mixed one with the other, and both twining about the heart:
both good, as Austin, holds, <span class="cite">l. 14. c. 9. de civ. Dei</span>, <a href="#note1802">[1802]</a><q>if they be
moderate; both pernicious if they be exorbitant.</q> This concupiscible
appetite, howsoever it may seem to carry with it a show of pleasure and
delight, and our concupiscences most part affect us with content and a
pleasing object, yet if they be in extremes, they rack and wring us on the
other side. A true saying it is, <q>Desire hath no rest;</q> is infinite in
itself, endless; and as <a href="#note1803">[1803]</a>one calls it, a perpetual rack, <a href="#note1804">[1804]</a>or
horse-mill, according to Austin, still going round as in a ring. They are
not so continual, as divers, <span lang="la">felicius atomos denumerare possem</span>, saith
<a href="#note1805">[1805]</a>Bernard, <span lang="la">quam motus cordis; nunc haec, nunc illa cogito</span>, you may as
well reckon up the motes in the sun as them. <a href="#note1806">[1806]</a><q>It extends itself to
everything,</q> as Guianerius will have it, <q>that is superfluously sought
after:</q>' or to any <a href="#note1807">[1807]</a>fervent desire, as Fernelius interprets it; be it
in what kind soever, it tortures if immoderate, and is (according to <a href="#note1808">[1808]</a>
Plater and others) an especial cause of melancholy. <span lang="la">Multuosis
concupiscentiis dilaniantur cogitationes meae</span>, <a href="#note1809">[1809]</a>Austin confessed,
that he was torn a pieces with his manifold desires: and so doth <a href="#note1810">[1810]</a>
Bernard complain, <q>that he could not rest for them a minute of an hour:
this I would have, and that, and then I desire to be such and such.</q> 'Tis a
hard matter therefore to confine them, being they are so various and many,
impossible to apprehend all. I will only insist upon some few of the chief,
and most noxious in their kind, as that exorbitant appetite and desire of
honour, which we commonly call ambition; love of money, which is
covetousness, and that greedy desire of gain: self-love, pride, and
inordinate desire of vainglory or applause, love of study in excess; love
of women (which will require a just volume of itself), of the other I will
briefly speak, and in their order.

<p>Ambition, a proud covetousness, or a dry thirst of honour, a great torture
of the mind, composed of envy, pride, and covetousness, a gallant madness,
one <a href="#note1811">[1811]</a>defines it a pleasant poison, Ambrose, <q>a canker of the soul, an
hidden plague:</q> <a href="#note1812">[1812]</a>Bernard, <q>a secret poison, the father of livor, and
mother of hypocrisy, the moth of holiness, and cause of madness, crucifying
and disquieting all that it takes hold of.</q> <a href="#note1813">[1813]</a>Seneca calls it, <span lang="la">rem
solicitam, timidam, vanam, ventosam</span>, a windy thing, a vain, solicitous,
and fearful thing. For commonly they that, like Sisyphus, roll this
restless stone of ambition, are in a perpetual agony, still <a href="#note1814">[1814]</a>
perplexed, <span lang="la">semper taciti, tritesque recedunt</span> (Lucretius), doubtful,
timorous, suspicious, loath to offend in word or deed, still cogging and
colloguing, embracing, capping, cringing, applauding, flattering,
fleering, visiting, waiting at men's doors, with all affability,
counterfeit honesty and humility. <a href="#note1815">[1815]</a>If that will not serve, if once
this humour (as <a href="#note1816">[1816]</a>Cyprian describes it) possess his thirsty soul,
<span lang="la">ambitionis salsugo ubi bibulam animam possidet</span>, by hook and by crook he
will obtain it, <q>and from his hole he will climb to all honours and
offices, if it be possible for him to get up, flattering one, bribing
another, he will leave no means unessay'd to win all.</q> <a href="#note1817">[1817]</a>It is a
wonder to see how slavishly these kind of men subject themselves, when they
are about a suit, to every inferior person; what pains they will take, run,
ride, cast, plot, countermine, protest and swear, vow, promise, what
labours undergo, early up, down late; how obsequious and affable they are,
how popular and courteous, how they grin and fleer upon every man they
meet; with what feasting and inviting, how they spend themselves and their
fortunes, in seeking that many times, which they had much better be
without; as <a href="#note1818">[1818]</a>Cyneas the orator told Pyrrhus: with what waking nights,
painful hours, anxious thoughts, and bitterness of mind, <span lang="la">inter spemque
metumque</span>, distracted and tired, they consume the interim of their time.
There can be no greater plague for the present. If they do obtain their
suit, which with such cost and solicitude they have sought, they are not so
freed, their anxiety is anew to begin, for they are never satisfied, <span lang="la">nihil
aliud nisi imperium spirant</span>, their thoughts, actions, endeavours are all
for sovereignty and honour, like <a href="#note1819">[1819]</a>Lues Sforza that huffing Duke of
Milan, <q>a man of singular wisdom, but profound ambition, born to his own,
and to the destruction of Italy,</q> though it be to their own ruin, and
friends' undoing, they will contend, they may not cease, but as a dog in a
wheel, a bird in a cage, or a squirrel in a chain, so <a href="#note1820">[1820]</a>Budaeus
compares them; <a href="#note1821">[1821]</a>they climb and climb still, with much labour, but
never make an end, never at the top. A knight would be a baronet, and then
a lord, and then a viscount, and then an earl, &amp;c.; a doctor, a dean, and
then a bishop; from tribune to praetor; from bailiff to major; first this
office, and then that; as Pyrrhus in <a href="#note1822">[1822]</a>Plutarch, they will first have
Greece, then Africa, and then Asia, and swell with Aesop's frog so long,
till in the end they burst, or come down with Sejanus, <span lang="la">ad Gemonias
scalas</span>, and break their own necks; or as Evangelus the piper in Lucian,
that blew his pipe so long, till he fell down dead. If he chance to miss,
and have a canvass, he is in a hell on the other side; so dejected, that he
is ready to hang himself, turn heretic, Turk, or traitor in an instant.
Enraged against his enemies, he rails, swears, fights, slanders, detracts,
envies, murders: and for his own part, <span lang="la">si appetitum explere non potest,
furore corripitur</span>; if he cannot satisfy his desire (as <a href="#note1823">[1823]</a>Bodine
writes) he runs mad. So that both ways, hit or miss, he is distracted so
long as his ambition lasts, he can look for no other but anxiety and care,
discontent and grief in the meantime, <a href="#note1824">[1824]</a>madness itself, or violent
death in the end. The event of this is common to be seen in populous
cities, or in princes' courts, for a courtier's life (as Budaeus describes
it) <q>is a <a href="#note1825">[1825]</a>gallimaufry of ambition, lust, fraud, imposture,
dissimulation, detraction, envy, pride; <a href="#note1826">[1826]</a>the court, a common
conventicle of flatterers, time-servers, politicians,</q> &amp;c.; or as <a href="#note1827">[1827]</a>
Anthony Perez will, <q>the suburbs of hell itself.</q> If you will see such
discontented persons, there you shall likely find them. <a href="#note1828">[1828]</a>And which he

<p>Plutarch, in his <a href="#note1829">[1829]</a>book whether the diseases of the body be more
grievous than those of the soul, is of opinion, <q>if you will examine all
the causes of our miseries in this life, you shall find them most part to
have had their beginning from stubborn anger, that furious desire of
contention, or some unjust or immoderate affection, as covetousness, &amp;c.</q>
From whence <q>are wars and contentions amongst you?</q> <a href="#note1830">[1830]</a>St. James asks:
I will add usury, fraud, rapine, simony, oppression, lying, swearing,
bearing false witness, &amp;c. are they not from this fountain of covetousness,
that greediness in getting, tenacity in keeping, sordidity in spending; that
they are so wicked, <a href="#note1831">[1831]</a><q>unjust against God, their neighbour,
themselves;</q> all comes hence. <q>The desire of money is the root of all evil,
and they that lust after it, pierce themselves through with many sorrows,</q>
<span class="bibcite">1 Tim. vi. 10</span>. Hippocrates therefore in his Epistle to Crateva, an
herbalist, gives him this good counsel, that if it were possible, <a href="#note1832">[1832]</a>
<q>amongst other herbs, he should cut up that weed of covetousness by the
roots, that there be no remainder left, and then know this for a certainty,
that together with their bodies, thou mayst quickly cure all the diseases
of their minds.</q> For it is indeed the pattern, image, epitome of all
melancholy, the fountain of many miseries, much discontented care and woe;
this <q>inordinate, or immoderate desire of gain, to get or keep money,</q> as
<a href="#note1833">[1833]</a>Bonaventure defines it: or, as Austin describes it, a madness of the
soul, Gregory a torture; Chrysostom, an insatiable drunkenness; Cyprian,
blindness, <span lang="la">speciosum supplicium</span>, a plague subverting kingdoms, families,
an <a href="#note1834">[1834]</a>incurable disease; Budaeus, an ill habit, <a href="#note1835">[1835]</a><q>yielding to no
remedies:</q> neither Aesculapius nor Plutus can cure them: a continual
plague, saith Solomon, and vexation of spirit, another hell. I know there
be some of opinion, that covetous men are happy, and worldly, wise, that
there is more pleasure in getting of wealth than in spending, and no
delight in the world like unto it. 'Twas <a href="#note1836">[1836]</a>Bias' problem of old, <q>With
what art thou not weary? with getting money. What is most delectable? to
gain.</q> What is it, trow you, that makes a poor man labour all his lifetime,
carry such great burdens, fare so hardly, macerate himself, and endure so
much misery, undergo such base offices with so great patience, to rise up
early, and lie down late, if there were not an extraordinary delight in
getting and keeping of money? What makes a merchant that hath no need,
<span lang="la">satis superque domi</span>, to range all over the world, through all those
intemperate <a href="#note1837">[1837]</a>Zones of heat and cold; voluntarily to venture his life,
and be content with such miserable famine, nasty usage, in a stinking ship;
if there were not a pleasure and hope to get money, which doth season the
rest, and mitigate his indefatigable pains? What makes them go into the
bowels of the earth, an hundred fathom deep, endangering their dearest
lives, enduring damps and filthy smells, when they have enough already, if
they could be content, and no such cause to labour, but an extraordinary
delight they take in riches. This may seem plausible at first show, a
popular and strong argument; but let him that so thinks, consider better of
it, and he shall soon perceive, that it is far otherwise than he supposeth;
it may be haply pleasing at the first, as most part all melancholy is. For
such men likely have some <span lang="la">lucida intervalla</span>, pleasant symptoms
intermixed; but you must note that of <a href="#note1838">[1838]</a>Chrysostom, <q>'Tis one thing to
be rich, another to be covetous:</q> generally they are all fools, dizzards,
madmen, <a href="#note1839">[1839]</a>miserable wretches, living besides themselves, <span lang="la">sine arte
fruendi</span>, in perpetual slavery, fear, suspicion, sorrow, and discontent,
<span lang="la">plus aloes quam mellis habent</span>; and are indeed, <q>rather possessed by their
money, than possessors:</q> as <a href="#note1840">[1840]</a>Cyprian hath it, <span lang="la">mancipati pecuniis</span>;
bound prentice to their goods, as <a href="#note1841">[1841]</a>Pliny; or as Chrysostom, <span lang="la">servi
divitiarum</span>, slaves and drudges to their substance; and we may conclude of
them all, as <a href="#note1842">[1842]</a>Valerius doth of Ptolomaeus king of Cyprus, <q>He was in
title a king of that island, but in his mind, a miserable drudge of money:</q>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1843">[1843]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;potiore metallis</div>
<div class="line">libertate carens&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
wanting his liberty, which is better than gold. Damasippus the Stoic, in
Horace, proves that all mortal men dote by fits, some one way, some
another, but that covetous men <a href="#note1844">[1844]</a>are madder than the rest; and he that
shall truly look into their estates, and examine their symptoms, shall find
no better of them, but that they are all <a href="#note1845">[1845]</a>fools, as Nabal was, <span lang="la">Re et
nomine</span> (<span class="bibcite">1. Reg. 15.</span>) For what greater folly can there be, or <a href="#note1846">[1846]</a>
madness, than to macerate himself when he need not? and when, as Cyprian
notes, <a href="#note1847">[1847]</a><q>he may be freed from his burden, and eased of his pains,
will go on still, his wealth increasing, when he hath enough, to get more,
to live besides himself,</q> to starve his genius, keep back from his wife
<a href="#note1848">[1848]</a>and children, neither letting them nor other friends use or enjoy
that which is theirs by right, and which they much need perhaps; like a
hog, or dog in the manger, he doth only keep it, because it shall do nobody
else good, hurting himself and others: and for a little momentary pelf,
damn his own soul? They are commonly sad and tetric by nature, as Achab's
spirit was because he could not get Naboth's vineyard, (<span class="bibcite">1. Reg. 22.</span>) and
if he lay out his money at any time, though it be to necessary uses, to his
own children's good, he brawls and scolds, his heart is heavy, much
disquieted he is, and loath to part from it: <span lang="la">Miser abstinet et timet uti</span>,
Hor. He is of a wearish, dry, pale constitution, and cannot sleep for cares
and worldly business; his riches, saith Solomon, will not let him sleep,
and unnecessary business which he heapeth on himself; or if he do sleep,
'tis a very unquiet, interrupt, unpleasing sleep: with his bags in his
arms,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;congestis undique sacc</div>
<div class="line">indormit inhians,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
And though he be at a banquet, or at some merry feast, <q>he sighs for grief
of heart</q> (as <a href="#note1849">[1849]</a>Cyprian hath it) <q>and cannot sleep though it be upon a
down bed; his wearish body takes no rest,</q> <a href="#note1850">[1850]</a><q>troubled in his abundance,
and sorrowful in plenty, unhappy for the present, and more unhappy in the
life to come.</q> Basil. He is a perpetual drudge, <a href="#note1851">[1851]</a>restless in his
thoughts, and never satisfied, a slave, a wretch, a dust-worm, <span lang="la">semper quod
idolo suo immolet, sedulus observat</span> Cypr. <span class="cite">prolog. ad sermon</span> still
seeking what sacrifice he may offer to his golden god, <span lang="la">per fas et nefas</span>,
he cares not how, his trouble is endless, <a href="#note1852">[1852]</a><span lang="la">crescunt divitiae, tamen
curtae nescio quid semper abest rei</span>: his wealth increaseth, and the more he
hath, the more <a href="#note1853">[1853]</a>he wants: like Pharaoh's lean kine, which devoured
the fat, and were not satisfied. <a href="#note1854">[1854]</a>Austin therefore defines
covetousness, <span lang="la">quarumlibet rerum inhonestam et insatiabilem cupiditatem</span> a
dishonest and insatiable desire of gain; and in one of his epistles
compares it to hell; <a href="#note1855">[1855]</a><q>which devours all, and yet never hath enough,
a bottomless pit,</q> an endless misery; <span lang="la">in quem scopulum avaritiae cadaverosi
senes utplurimum impingunt</span>, and that which is their greatest corrosive,
they are in continual suspicion, fear, and distrust, He thinks his own wife
and children are so many thieves, and go about to cozen him, his servants
are all false:

<div class="line">His goods are gone, and he is quite undone.</div>
</div>
<span lang="la">Timidus Plutus</span>, an old proverb, As fearful as Plutus: so doth Aristophanes
and Lucian bring him in fearful still, pale, anxious, suspicious, and
trusting no man, <a href="#note1856">[1856]</a><q>They are afraid of tempests for their corn; they
are afraid of their friends lest they should ask something of them, beg or
borrow; they are afraid of their enemies lest they hurt them, thieves lest
they rob them; they are afraid of war and afraid of peace, afraid of rich
and afraid of poor; afraid of all.</q> Last of all, they are afraid of want,
that they shall die beggars, which makes them lay up still, and dare not
use that they have: what if a dear year come, or dearth, or some loss? and
were it not that they are both to <a href="#note1857">[1857]</a>lay out money on a rope, they
would be hanged forthwith, and sometimes die to save charges, and make away
themselves, if their corn and cattle miscarry; though they have abundance
left, as <a href="#note1858">[1858]</a>Agellius notes. <a href="#note1859">[1859]</a>Valerius makes mention of one that
in a famine sold a mouse for 200 pence, and famished himself: such are
their cares, <a href="#note1860">[1860]</a>griefs and perpetual fears. These symptoms are
elegantly expressed by Theophrastus in his character of a covetous man;
<a href="#note1861">[1861]</a><q>lying in bed, he asked his wife whether she shut the trunks and
chests fast, the cap-case be sealed, and whether the hall door be bolted;
and though she say all is well, he riseth out of his bed in his shirt,
barefoot and barelegged, to see whether it be so, with a dark lantern
searching every corner, scarce sleeping a wink all night.</q> Lucian in that
pleasant and witty dialogue called Gallus, brings in Mycillus the cobbler
disputing with his cock, sometimes Pythagoras; where after much speech pro
and con, to prove the happiness of a mean estate, and discontents of a rich
man, Pythagoras' cock in the end, to illustrate by examples that which he
had said, brings him to Gnyphon the usurer's house at midnight, and after
that to Encrates; whom, they found both awake, casting up their accounts,
and telling of their money, <a href="#note1862">[1862]</a>lean, dry, pale and anxious, still
suspecting lest somebody should make a hole through the wall, and so get
in; or if a rat or mouse did but stir, starting upon a sudden, and running
to the door to see whether all were fast. Plautus, in his Aulularia, makes
old Euclio <a href="#note1863">[1863]</a>commanding Staphyla his wife to shut the doors fast, and
the fire to be put out, lest anybody should make that an errand to come to
his house: when he washed his hands, <a href="#note1864">[1864]</a>he was loath to fling away the
foul water, complaining that he was undone, because the smoke got out of
his roof. And as he went from home, seeing a crow scratch upon the
muck-hill, returned in all haste, taking it for <span lang="la">malum omen</span>, an ill sign,
his money was digged up; with many such. He that will but observe their
actions, shall find these and many such passages not feigned for sport, but
really performed, verified indeed by such covetous and miserable wretches,
and that it is,
<div class="poem" lang="la">

<h4><a name="1.2.3.13"></a>SUBSECT. XIII.&mdash;<i>Love of Gaming, &amp;c. and pleasures immoderate; Causes</i>.</h4>

<p>It is a wonder to see, how many poor, distressed, miserable wretches, one
shall meet almost in every path and street, begging for an alms, that have
been well descended, and sometimes in flourishing estate, now ragged,
tattered, and ready to be starved, lingering out a painful life, in
discontent and grief of body and mind, and all through immoderate lust,
gaming, pleasure and riot. 'Tis the common end of all sensual epicures and
brutish prodigals, that are stupefied and carried away headlong with their
several pleasures and lusts. Cebes in his table, St. Ambrose in his second
book of Abel and Cain, and amongst the rest Lucian in his tract <span class="cite">de Mercede
conductis</span>, hath excellent well deciphered such men's proceedings in his
picture of Opulentia, whom he feigns to dwell on the top of a high mount,
much sought after by many suitors; at their first coming they are generally
entertained by pleasure and dalliance, and have all the content that
possibly may be given, so long as their money lasts: but when their means
fail, they are contemptibly thrust out at a back door, headlong, and there
left to shame, reproach, despair. And he at first that had so many
attendants, parasites, and followers, young and lusty, richly arrayed, and
all the dainty fare that might be had, with all kind of welcome and good
respect, is now upon a sudden stripped of all, <a href="#note1866">[1866]</a>pale, naked, old,
diseased and forsaken, cursing his stars, and ready to strangle himself;
having no other company but repentance, sorrow, grief, derision, beggary,
and contempt, which are his daily attendants to his life's end. As the
<a href="#note1867">[1867]</a>prodigal son had exquisite music, merry company, dainty fare at
first; but a sorrowful reckoning in the end; so have all such vain delights
and their followers. <a href="#note1868">[1868]</a><span lang="la">Tristes voluptatum exitus, et quisquis
voluptatum suarum reminisci volet, intelliget</span>, as bitter as gall and
wormwood is their last; grief of mind, madness itself. The ordinary rocks
upon which such men do impinge and precipitate themselves, are cards, dice,
hawks, and hounds, <span lang="la">Insanum venandi studium</span>, one calls it, <span lang="la">insanae
substructiones</span>: their mad structures, disports, plays, &amp;c., when they are
unseasonably used, imprudently handled, and beyond their fortunes. Some men
are consumed by mad fantastical buildings, by making galleries, cloisters,
terraces, walks, orchards, gardens, pools, rillets, bowers, and such like
places of pleasure; <span lang="la">Inutiles domos</span>, <a href="#note1869">[1869]</a>Xenophon calls them, which
howsoever they be delightsome things in themselves, and acceptable to all
beholders, an ornament, and benefiting some great men: yet unprofitable to
others, and the sole overthrow of their estates. Forestus in his
observations hath an example of such a one that became melancholy upon the
like occasion, having consumed his substance in an unprofitable building,
which would afterward yield him no advantage. Others, I say, are <a href="#note1870">[1870]</a>
overthrown by those mad sports of hawking and hunting; honest recreations,
and fit for some great men, but not for every base inferior person; whilst
they will maintain their falconers, dogs, and hunting nags, their wealth,
saith <a href="#note1871">[1871]</a>Salmutze, <q>runs away with hounds, and their fortunes fly away
with hawks.</q> They persecute beasts so long, till in the end they themselves
degenerate into beasts, as <a href="#note1872">[1872]</a>Agrippa taxeth them, <a href="#note1873">[1873]</a>Actaeon like,
for as he was eaten to death by his own dogs, so do they devour themselves
and their patrimonies, in such idle and unnecessary disports, neglecting in
the mean time their more necessary business, and to follow their vocations.
Over-mad too sometimes are our great men in delighting, and doting too much
on it. <a href="#note1874">[1874]</a><q>When they drive poor husbandmen from their tillage,</q> as
<a href="#note1875">[1875]</a>Sarisburiensis objects, <span class="cite">Polycrat. l. 1. c. 4</span>, <q>fling down
country farms, and whole towns, to make parks, and forests, starving men to
feed beasts, and <a href="#note1876">[1876]</a>punishing in the mean time such a man that shall
molest their game, more severely than him that is otherwise a common
hacker, or a notorious thief.</q> But great men are some ways to be excused,
the meaner sort have no evasion why they should not be counted mad. Poggius
the Florentine tells a merry story to this purpose, condemning the folly
and impertinent business of such kind of persons. A physician of Milan,
saith he, that cured mad men, had a pit of water in his house, in which he
kept his patients, some up to the knees, some to the girdle, some to the
chin, <span lang="la">pro modo insaniae</span>, as they were more or less affected. One of them
by chance, that was well recovered, stood in the door, and seeing a gallant
ride by with a hawk on his fist, well mounted, with his spaniels after him,
would needs know to what use all this preparation served; he made answer to
kill certain fowls; the patient demanded again, what his fowl might be
worth which he killed in a year; he replied 5 or 10 crowns; and when he
urged him farther what his dogs, horse, and hawks stood him in, he told him
400 crowns; with that the patient bad be gone, as he loved his life and
welfare, for if our master come and find thee here, he will put thee in the
pit amongst mad men up to the chin: taxing the madness and folly of such
vain men that spend themselves in those idle sports, neglecting their
business and necessary affairs. Leo Decimus, that hunting pope, is much
discommended by <a href="#note1877">[1877]</a>Jovius in his life, for his immoderate desire of
hawking and hunting, in so much that (as he saith) he would sometimes live
about Ostia weeks and months together, leave suitors <a href="#note1878">[1878]</a>unrespected,
bulls and pardons unsigned, to his own prejudice, and many private men's
loss. <a href="#note1879">[1879]</a><q>And if he had been by chance crossed in his sport, or his
game not so good, he was so impatient, that he would revile and miscall
many times men of great worth with most bitter taunts, look so sour, be so
angry and waspish, so grieved and molested, that it is incredible to relate
it.</q> But if he had good sport, and been well pleased, on the other side,
<span lang="la">incredibili munificentia</span>, with unspeakable bounty and munificence he
would reward all his fellow hunters, and deny nothing to any suitor when he
was in that mood. To say truth, 'tis the common humour of all gamesters, as
Galataeus observes, if they win, no men living are so jovial and merry, but
<a href="#note1880">[1880]</a>if they lose, though it be but a trifle, two or three games at
tables, or a dealing at cards for two pence a game, they are so choleric
and testy that no man may speak with them, and break many times into
violent passions, oaths, imprecations, and unbeseeming speeches, little
differing from mad men for the time. Generally of all gamesters and gaming,
if it be excessive, thus much we may conclude, that whether they win or
lose for the present, their winnings are not <span lang="la">Munera fortunae, sed insidiae</span>
as that wise Seneca determines, not fortune's gifts, but baits, the common
catastrophe is <a href="#note1881">[1881]</a>beggary, <a href="#note1882">[1882]</a><span lang="la">Ut pestis vitam, sic adimit alea
pecuniam</span>, as the plague takes away life, doth gaming goods, for <a href="#note1883">[1883]</a>
<span lang="la">omnes nudi, inopes et egeni</span>;

</div>
For a little pleasure they take, and some small gains and gettings now and
then, their wives and children are ringed in the meantime, and they
themselves with loss of body and soul rue it in the end. I will say nothing
of those prodigious prodigals, <span lang="la">perdendae pecuniae, genitos</span>, as he <a href="#note1885">[1885]</a>
taxed Anthony, <span lang="la">Qui patrimonium sine ulla fori calumnia amittunt</span>, saith
<a href="#note1886">[1886]</a>Cyprian, and <a href="#note1887">[1887]</a>mad sybaritical spendthrifts, <span lang="la">Quique una
comedunt patrimonia coena</span>; that eat up all at a breakfast, at a supper, or
amongst bawds, parasites, and players, consume themselves in an instant, as
if they had flung it into <a href="#note1888">[1888]</a>Tiber, with great wages, vain and idle
expenses, &amp;c., not themselves only, but even all their friends, as a man
desperately swimming drowns him that comes to help him, by suretyship and
borrowing they will willingly undo all their associates and allies. <a href="#note1889">[1889]</a>
<span lang="la">Irati pecuniis</span>, as he saith, angry with their money: <a href="#note1890">[1890]</a><q>what with a
wanton eye, a liquorish tongue, and a gamesome hand,</q> when they have
indiscreetly impoverished themselves, mortgaged their wits, together with
their lands, and entombed their ancestors' fair possessions in their
bowels, they may lead the rest of their days in prison, as many times they
do; they repent at leisure; and when all is gone begin to be thrifty: but
<span lang="la">Sera est in fundo parsimonia</span>, 'tis then too late to look about; their
<a href="#note1891">[1891]</a>end is misery, sorrow, shame, and discontent. And well they deserve
to be infamous and discontent. <a href="#note1892">[1892]</a><span lang="la">Catamidiari in Amphitheatro</span>, as by
Adrian the emperor's edict they were of old, <span lang="la">decoctores bonorum suorum</span>,
so he calls them, prodigal fools, to be publicly shamed, and hissed out of
all societies, rather than to be pitied or relieved. <a href="#note1893">[1893]</a>The Tuscans and
Boetians brought their bankrupts into the marketplace in a bier with an
empty purse carried before them, all the boys following, where they sat all
day <span lang="la">circumstante plebe</span>, to be infamous and ridiculous. At <a href="#note1894">[1894]</a>Padua in
Italy they have a stone called the stone of turpitude, near the
senate-house, where spendthrifts, and such as disclaim non-payment of
debts, do sit with their hinder parts bare, that by that note of disgrace
others may be terrified from all such vain expense, or borrowing more than
they can tell how to pay. The <a href="#note1895">[1895]</a>civilians of old set guardians over
such brain-sick prodigals, as they did over madmen, to moderate their
expenses, that they should not so loosely consume their fortunes, to the
utter undoing of their families.

<p>I may not here omit those two main plagues, and common dotages of human
kind, wine and women, which have infatuated and besotted myriads of people;
they go commonly together.

sister, killed his father, &amp;c. A true saying it was of him, <span lang="la">Vino dari

causeth <q>poverty and want,</q> (<span class="bibcite">Prov. xxi.</span>) shame and disgrace. <span lang="la">Multi

or <a href="#note1899">[1899]</a>free madness, as Seneca calls it, purchase unto themselves
eternal tediousness and trouble.

<p>That other madness is on women, <span lang="la">Apostatare facit cor</span>, saith the wise man,

<p>Self-love, pride, and vainglory, <a href="#note1903">[1903]</a><span lang="la">caecus amor sui</span>, which Chrysostom
calls one of the devil's three great nets; <a href="#note1904">[1904]</a><q>Bernard, an arrow which

perceived,</q> are main causes. Where neither anger, lust, covetousness, fear,
sorrow, &amp;c., nor any other perturbation can lay hold; this will slyly and
insensibly pervert us, <span lang="la">Quem non gula vicit, Philautia, superavit</span>, (saith
Cyprian) whom surfeiting could not overtake, self-love hath overcome.
<a href="#note1905">[1905]</a><q>He hath scorned all money, bribes, gifts, upright otherwise and
sincere, hath inserted himself to no fond imagination, and sustained all
those tyrannical concupiscences of the body, hath lost all his honour,
captivated by vainglory.</q> Chrysostom, <span class="cite">sup. Io.</span> <span lang="la">Tu sola animum mentemque
peruris, gloria</span>. A great assault and cause of our present malady, although
we do most part neglect, take no notice of it, yet this is a violent
batterer of our souls, causeth melancholy and dotage. This pleasing humour;
this soft and whispering popular air, <span lang="la">Amabilis insania</span>; this delectable
frenzy, most irrefragable passion, <span lang="la">Mentis gratissimus error</span>, this
acceptable disease, which so sweetly sets upon us, ravisheth our senses,
lulls our souls asleep, puffs up our hearts as so many bladders, and that
without all feeling, <a href="#note1906">[1906]</a>insomuch as <q>those that are misaffected with
it, never so much as once perceive it, or think of any cure.</q> We commonly
love him best in this <a href="#note1907">[1907]</a>malady, that doth us most harm, and are very
willing to be hurt; <span lang="la">adulationibus nostris libentur facemus</span> (saith <a href="#note1908">[1908]</a>
Jerome) we love him, we love him for it: <a href="#note1909">[1909]</a><span lang="la">O Bonciari suave, suave

doth ingenuously confess to his dear friend Augurinus, <q>all thy writings
are most acceptable, but those especially that speak of us.</q> Again, a
little after to Maximus, <a href="#note1911">[1911]</a><q>I cannot express how pleasing it is to me
to hear myself commended.</q> Though we smile to ourselves, at least
ironically, when parasites bedaub us with false encomiums, as many princes
cannot choose but do, <span lang="la">Quum tale quid nihil intra se repererint</span>, when they
know they come as far short, as a mouse to an elephant, of any such
virtues; yet it doth us good. Though we seem many times to be angry, <a href="#note1912">[1912]</a>
<q>and blush at our own praises, yet our souls inwardly rejoice, it puffs us
up;</q> 'tis <span lang="la">fallax suavitas, blandus daemon</span>, <q>makes us swell beyond our
bounds, and forget ourselves.</q> Her two daughters are lightness of mind,
immoderate joy and pride, not excluding those other concomitant vices,
which <a href="#note1913">[1913]</a>Iodocus Lorichius reckons up; bragging, hypocrisy,
peevishness, and curiosity.

<p>Now the common cause of this mischief, ariseth from ourselves or others,
<a href="#note1914">[1914]</a>we are active and passive. It proceeds inwardly from ourselves, as
we are active causes, from an overweening conceit we have of our good
parts, own worth, (which indeed is no worth) our bounty, favour, grace,
valour, strength, wealth, patience, meekness, hospitality, beauty,
temperance, gentry, knowledge, wit, science, art, learning, our <a href="#note1915">[1915]</a>
excellent gifts and fortunes, for which, Narcissus-like, we admire,
flatter, and applaud ourselves, and think all the world esteems so of us;
and as deformed women easily believe those that tell them they be fair, we
are too credulous of our own good parts and praises, too well persuaded of
ourselves. We brag and venditate our <a href="#note1916">[1916]</a>own works, and scorn all others
in respect of us; <span lang="la">Inflati scientia</span>, (saith Paul) our wisdom, <a href="#note1917">[1917]</a>our
learning, all our geese are swans, and we as basely esteem and vilify other
men's, as we do over-highly prize and value our own. We will not suffer
them to be <span lang="la">in secundis</span>, no, not <span lang="la">in tertiis</span>; what, <span lang="la">Mecum confertur
Ulysses</span>? they are <span lang="la">Mures, Muscae, culices prae se</span>, nits and flies
compared to his inexorable and supercilious, eminent and arrogant worship:
though indeed they be far before him. Only wise, only rich, only fortunate,
valorous, and fair, puffed up with this tympany of self-conceit; <a href="#note1918">[1918]</a>as
that proud Pharisee, they are not (as they suppose) <q>like other men,</q> of a
purer and more precious metal: <a href="#note1919">[1919]</a><span lang="la">Soli rei gerendi sunt efficaces</span>,
which that wise Periander held of such: <a href="#note1920">[1920]</a><span lang="la">meditantur omne qui prius

that he thought himself inferior to no man living, like <a href="#note1922">[1922]</a>Callisthenes
the philosopher, that neither held Alexander's acts, or any other subject
worthy of his pen, such was his insolency; or Seleucus king of Syria, who
thought none fit to contend with him but the Romans. <a href="#note1923">[1923]</a><span lang="la">Eos solos
dignos ratus quibuscum de imperio certaret</span>. That which Tully writ to
Atticus long since, is still in force. <a href="#note1924">[1924]</a><q>There was never yet true
poet nor orator, that thought any other better than himself.</q> And such for
the most part are your princes, potentates, great philosophers,
historiographers, authors of sects or heresies, and all our great scholars,
as <a href="#note1925">[1925]</a>Hierom defines; <q>a natural philosopher is a glorious creature,
and a very slave of rumour, fame, and popular opinion,</q> and though they
write <span lang="la">de contemptu gloriae</span>, yet as he observes, they will put their names
to their books. <span lang="la">Vobis et famae, me semper dedi</span>, saith Trebellius Pollio,
I have wholly consecrated myself to you and fame. <q>'Tis all my desire,
night and day, 'tis all my study to raise my name.</q> Proud <a href="#note1926">[1926]</a>Pliny
seconds him; <span lang="la">Quamquam O</span>! &amp;c. and that vainglorious <a href="#note1927">[1927]</a>orator is not
ashamed to confess in an Epistle of his to Marcus Lecceius, <span lang="la">Ardeo
incredibili cupididate</span>, &amp;c. <q>I burn with an incredible desire to have my
<a href="#note1928">[1928]</a>name registered in thy book.</q> Out of this fountain proceed all those
cracks and brags,&mdash;<a href="#note1929">[1929]</a><span lang="la">speramus carmina fingi Posse linenda cedro, et

<q>Let none shed tears over me, or adorn my bier with sorrow&mdash;because I am
eternally in the mouths of men.</q> With many such proud strains, and foolish
flashes too common with writers. Not so much as Democharis on the <a href="#note1931">[1931]</a>

well he deserves, because he writ of fame; and every trivial poet must be
renowned,&mdash;<span lang="la">Plausuque petit clarescere vulgi</span>. <q>He seeks the applause of

tomes, built such famous monuments, strong castles, and Mausolean tombs, to
have their acts eternised,&mdash;<span lang="la">Digito monstrari, et dicier hic est</span>; <q>to be
pointed at with the finger, and to have it said 'there he goes,'</q> to see
their names inscribed, as Phryne on the walls of Thebes, <span lang="la">Phryne fecit</span>;
this causeth so many bloody battles,&mdash;<span lang="la">Et noctes cogit vigilare serenas</span>;
<q>and induces us to watch during calm nights.</q> Long journeys, <span lang="la">Magnum iter
intendo, sed dat mihi gloria vires</span>, <q>I contemplate a monstrous journey,
but the love of glory strengthens me for it,</q> gaining honour, a little
applause, pride, self-love, vainglory. This is it which makes them take
such pains, and break out into those ridiculous strains, this high conceit
of themselves, to <a href="#note1932">[1932]</a>scorn all others; <span lang="la">ridiculo fastu et intolerando
contemptu</span>; as <a href="#note1933">[1933]</a>Palaemon the grammarian contemned Varro, <span lang="la">secum et

insolency, that they cannot endure to be contradicted, <a href="#note1934">[1934]</a><q>or hear of
anything but their own commendation,</q> which Hierom notes of such kind of
men. And as <a href="#note1935">[1935]</a>Austin well seconds him, <q>'tis their sole study day and
night to be commended and applauded.</q> When as indeed, in all wise men's
judgments, <span lang="la">quibus cor sapit</span>, they are <a href="#note1936">[1936]</a>mad, empty vessels, funges,
beside themselves, derided, <span lang="la">et ut Camelus in proverbio quaerens cornua,
etiam quas habebat aures amisit</span>, <a href="#note1937">[1937]</a>their works are toys, as an
almanac out of date, <a href="#note1938">[1938]</a><span lang="la">authoris pereunt garrulitate sui</span>, they seek
fame and immortality, but reap dishonour and infamy, they are a common
obloquy, <span lang="la">insensati</span>, and come far short of that which they suppose or
expect. <a href="#note1939">[1939]</a><span lang="la">O puer ut sis vitalis metuo</span>,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;How much I dread</div>
<div class="line">Thy days are short, some lord shall strike thee dead.</div>
</div>
Of so many myriads of poets, rhetoricians, philosophers, sophisters, as
<a href="#note1940">[1940]</a>Eusebius well observes, which have written in former ages, scarce
one of a thousand's works remains, <span lang="la">nomina et libri simul cum corporibus
interierunt</span>, their books and bodies are perished together. It is not as
they vainly think, they shall surely be admired and immortal, as one told
Philip of Macedon insultingly, after a victory, that his shadow was no
longer than before, we may say to them,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Nos demiramur, sed non cum deside vulgo,</div>
<div class="line">Sed velut Harpyas, Gorgonas, et Furias.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">We marvel too, not as the vulgar we,</div>
<div class="line">But as we Gorgons, Harpies, or Furies see.</div>
</div>
Or if we do applaud, honour and admire, <span lang="la">quota pars</span>, how small a part, in
respect of the whole world, never so much as hears our names, how few take
notice of us, how slender a tract, as scant as Alcibiades' land in a map!
And yet every man must and will be immortal, as he hopes, and extend his
fame to our antipodes, when as half, no not a quarter of his own province
or city, neither knows nor hears of him&mdash;but say they did, what's a city to
a kingdom, a kingdom to Europe, Europe to the world, the world itself that
must have an end, if compared to the least visible star in the firmament,
eighteen times bigger than it? and then if those stars be infinite, and
every star there be a sun, as some will, and as this sun of ours hath his
planets about him, all inhabited, what proportion bear we to them, and
where's our glory? <span lang="la">Orbem terrarum victor Romanus habebat</span>, as he
cracked in Petronius, all the world was under Augustus: and so in
Constantine's time, Eusebius brags he governed all the world, <span lang="la">universum
mundum praeclare admodum administravit,&mdash;et omnes orbis gentes Imperatori
subjecti</span>: so of Alexander it is given out, the four monarchies, &amp;c. when
as neither Greeks nor Romans ever had the fifteenth part of the now known
world, nor half of that which was then described. What braggadocios are
they and we then? <span lang="la">quam brevis hic de nobis sermo</span>, as <a href="#note1941">[1941]</a>he said,
<a href="#note1942">[1942]</a><span lang="la">pudebit aucti nominis</span>, how short a time, how little a while doth
this fame of ours continue? Every private province, every small territory
and city, when we have all done, will yield as generous spirits, as brave
examples in all respects, as famous as ourselves, Cadwallader in Wales,
Rollo in Normandy, Robin Hood and Little John, are as much renowned in
Sherwood, as Caesar in Rome, Alexander in Greece, or his Hephestion, <a href="#note1943">[1943]</a>
<span lang="la">Omnis aetas omnisque populus in exemplum et admirationem veniet</span>, every
town, city, book, is full of brave soldiers, senators, scholars; and though
<a href="#note1944">[1944]</a>Bracyclas was a worthy captain, a good man, and as they thought, not
to be matched in Lacedaemon, yet as his mother truly said, <span lang="la">plures habet
Sparta Bracyda meliores</span>, Sparta had many better men than ever he was; and
howsoever thou admirest thyself, thy friend, many an obscure fellow the
world never took notice of, had he been in place or action, would have done
much better than he or he, or thou thyself.

<p>Another kind of mad men there is opposite to these, that are insensibly
mad, and know not of it, such as contemn all praise and glory, think
themselves most free, when as indeed they are most mad: <span lang="la">calcant sed alio
fastu</span>: a company of cynics, such as are monks, hermits, anchorites, that
contemn the world, contemn themselves, contemn all titles, honours,
offices: and yet in that contempt are more proud than any man living
whatsoever. They are proud in humility, proud in that they are not proud,
<span lang="la">saepe homo de vanae gloriae contemptu, vanius gloriatur</span>, as Austin hath it,
<span class="cite">confess. lib. 10, cap. 38</span>, like Diogenes, <span lang="la">intus gloriantur</span>, they brag
inwardly, and feed themselves fat with a self-conceit of sanctity, which is
no better than hypocrisy. They go in sheep's russet, many great men that
might maintain themselves in cloth of gold, and seem to be dejected, humble
by their outward carriage, when as inwardly they are swollen full of pride,
arrogancy, and self-conceit. And therefore Seneca adviseth his friend
Lucilius, <a href="#note1945">[1945]</a><q>in his attire and gesture, outward actions, especially to
avoid all such things as are more notable in themselves: as a rugged
attire, hirsute head, horrid beard, contempt of money, coarse lodging, and
whatsoever leads to fame that opposite way.</q>

<p>All this madness yet proceeds from ourselves, the main engine which batters
us is from others, we are merely passive in this business: from a company
of parasites and flatterers, that with immoderate praise, and bombast
epithets, glossing titles, false eulogiums, so bedaub and applaud, gild over
many a silly and undeserving man, that they clap him quite out of his wits.
<span lang="la">Res imprimis violenta est</span>, as Hierom notes, this common applause is a
most violent thing, <span lang="la">laudum placenta</span>, a drum, fife, and trumpet cannot so
animate; that fattens men, erects and dejects them in an instant. <a href="#note1946">[1946]</a>
<span lang="la">Palma negata macrum, donata reducit opimum</span>. It makes them fat and lean,
as frost doth conies. <a href="#note1947">[1947]</a><q>And who is that mortal man that can so
contain himself, that if he be immoderately commended and applauded, will
not be moved?</q> Let him be what he will, those parasites will overturn him:
if he be a king, he is one of the nine worthies, more than a man, a god
forthwith,&mdash;<a href="#note1948">[1948]</a><span lang="la">edictum Domini Deique nostri</span>: and they will sacrifice
unto him,
<div class="poem" lang="la">

</div>
If he be a soldier, then Themistocles, Epaminondas, Hector, Achilles, <span lang="la">duo
fulmina belli, triumviri terrarum</span>, &amp;c., and the valour of both Scipios is
too little for him, he is <span lang="la">invictissimus, serenissimus, multis trophaeus
ornatissimus, naturae, dominus</span>, although he be <span lang="la">lepus galeatus</span>, indeed a
very coward, a milk-sop, <a href="#note1950">[1950]</a>and as he said of Xerxes, <span lang="la">postremus in
pugna, primus in fuga</span>, and such a one as never durst look his enemy in the
face. If he be a big man, then is he a Samson, another Hercules; if he
pronounce a speech, another Tully or Demosthenes; as of Herod in the Acts,
<q>the voice of God and not of man:</q> if he can make a verse, Homer, Virgil,
&amp;c., And then my silly weak patient takes all these eulogiums to himself;
if he be a scholar so commended for his much reading, excellent style,
method, &amp;c., he will eviscerate himself like a spider, study to death,
<span lang="la">Laudatas ostendit avis Junonia pennas</span>, peacock-like he will display all
his feathers. If he be a soldier, and so applauded, his valour extolled,
though it be <span lang="la">impar congressus</span>, as that of Troilus and Achilles, <span lang="la">Infelix
puer</span>, he will combat with a giant, run first upon a breach, as another
<a href="#note1951">[1951]</a>Philippus, he will ride into the thickest of his enemies. Commend
his housekeeping, and he will beggar himself; commend his temperance, he
will starve himself.

he is mad, mad, mad, no woe with him:&mdash;<span lang="la">impatiens consortis erit</span>, he will
over the <a href="#note1953">[1953]</a>Alps to be talked of, or to maintain his credit. Commend an
ambitious man, some proud prince or potentate, <span lang="la">si plus aequo laudetur</span>
(saith <a href="#note1954">[1954]</a>Erasmus) <span lang="la">cristas erigit, exuit hominem, Deum se putat</span>, he

How did this work with Alexander, that would needs be Jupiter's son, and go
like Hercules in a lion's skin? Domitian a god, <a href="#note1957">[1957]</a>(<span lang="la">Dominus Deus
noster sic fieri jubet</span>,) like the <a href="#note1958">[1958]</a>Persian kings, whose image was
adored by all that came into the city of Babylon. Commodus the emperor was
so gulled by his flattering parasites, that he must be called Hercules.
<a href="#note1959">[1959]</a>Antonius the Roman would be crowned with ivy, carried in a chariot,
and adored for Bacchus. Cotys, king of Thrace, was married to <a href="#note1960">[1960]</a>
Minerva, and sent three several messengers one after another, to see if she
were come to his bedchamber. Such a one was <a href="#note1961">[1961]</a>Jupiter Menecrates,
Maximinus, Jovianus, Dioclesianus Herculeus, Sapor the Persian king,
brother of the sun and moon, and our modern Turks, that will be gods on
earth, kings of kings, God's shadow, commanders of all that may be
commanded, our kings of China and Tartary in this present age. Such a one
was Xerxes, that would whip the sea, fetter Neptune, <span lang="la">stulta jactantia</span>,
and send a challenge to Mount Athos; and such are many sottish princes,
brought into a fool's paradise by their parasites, 'tis a common humour,
incident to all men, when they are in great places, or come to the solstice
of honour, have done, or deserved well, to applaud and flatter themselves.
<span lang="la">Stultitiam suam produnt</span>, &amp;c., (saith <a href="#note1962">[1962]</a>Platerus) your very tradesmen
if they be excellent, will crack and brag, and show their folly in excess.
They have good parts, and they know it, you need not tell them of it; out
of a conceit of their worth, they go smiling to themselves, a perpetual
meditation of their trophies and plaudits, they run at last quite mad, and
lose their wits.<a href="#note1963">[1963]</a>Petrarch, <span class="cite">lib. 1 de contemptu mundi</span>, confessed as
much of himself, and Cardan, in his fifth book of wisdom, gives an instance
in a smith of Milan, a fellow-citizen of his, <a href="#note1964">[1964]</a>one Galeus de Rubeis,
that being commended for refining of an instrument of Archimedes, for joy
ran mad. Plutarch in the life of Artaxerxes, hath such a like story of one
Chamus, a soldier, that wounded king Cyrus in battle, and <q>grew thereupon
so <a href="#note1965">[1965]</a>arrogant, that in a short space after he lost his wits.</q> So many
men, if any new honour, office, preferment, booty, treasure, possession, or
patrimony, <span lang="la">ex insperato</span> fall unto them for immoderate joy, and continual
meditation of it, cannot sleep <a href="#note1966">[1966]</a>or tell what they say or do, they are
so ravished on a sudden; and with vain conceits transported, there is no
rule with them. Epaminondas, therefore, the next day after his Leuctrian
victory, <a href="#note1967">[1967]</a><q>came abroad all squalid and submiss,</q> and gave no other
reason to his friends of so doing, than that he perceived himself the day
before, by reason of his good fortune, to be too insolent, overmuch joyed.
That wise and virtuous lady, <a href="#note1968">[1968]</a>Queen Katherine, Dowager of England,
in private talk, upon like occasion, said, that <a href="#note1969">[1969]</a><q>she would not
willingly endure the extremity of either fortune; but if it were so, that
of necessity she must undergo the one, she would be in adversity, because
comfort was never wanting in it, but still counsel and government were
defective in the other:</q> they could not moderate themselves.

<h4><a name="1.2.3.15"></a>SUBSECT. XV.&mdash;<i>Love of Learning, or overmuch study. With a Digression of the misery of Scholars, and why the Muses are Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>Leonartus Fuchsius <span class="cite">Instit. lib. iii. sect. 1. cap. 1.</span> Felix Plater,
<span class="cite">lib. iii. de mentis alienat</span>. Herc. de Saxonia, <span class="cite">Tract. post. de melanch.
cap. 3</span>, speak of a <a href="#note1970">[1970]</a>peculiar fury, which comes by overmuch study.
Fernelius, <span class="cite">lib. 1, cap. 18</span>, <a href="#note1971">[1971]</a>puts study, contemplation, and
continual meditation, as an especial cause of madness: and in his <span class="cite">86
consul.</span> cites the same words. Jo. Arculanus, <span class="cite">in lib. 9, Rhasis ad
Alnansorem, cap. 16</span>, amongst other causes reckons up <span lang="la">studium vehemens</span>:
so doth Levinus Lemnius, <span class="cite">lib. de occul. nat. mirac. lib. 1, cap. 16.</span>
<a href="#note1972">[1972]</a><q>Many men</q> (saith he) <q>come to this malady by continual <a href="#note1973">[1973]</a>study,
and night-waking, and of all other men, scholars are most subject to it:</q>
and such Rhasis adds, <a href="#note1974">[1974]</a><q>that have commonly the finest wits.</q> <span class="cite">Cont.
lib. 1, tract. 9</span>, Marsilius Ficinus, <span class="cite">de sanit. tuenda, lib. 1. cap. 7</span>,
puts melancholy amongst one of those five principal plagues of students,
'tis a common Maul unto them all, and almost in some measure an inseparable
companion. Varro belike for that cause calls <span lang="la">Tristes Philosophos et
severos</span>, severe, sad, dry, tetric, are common epithets to scholars: and
<a href="#note1975">[1975]</a>Patritius therefore, in the institution of princes, would not have
them to be great students. For (as Machiavel holds) study weakens their
bodies, dulls the spirits, abates their strength and courage; and good
scholars are never good soldiers, which a certain Goth well perceived, for
when his countrymen came into Greece, and would have burned all their
books, he cried out against it, by no means they should do it, <a href="#note1976">[1976]</a>
<q>leave them that plague, which in time will consume all their vigour, and
martial spirits.</q> The <a href="#note1977">[1977]</a>Turks abdicated Cornutus the next heir from
the empire, because he was so much given to his book: and 'tis the common
tenet of the world, that learning dulls and diminisheth the spirits, and so
<span lang="la">per consequens</span> produceth melancholy.

<p>Two main reasons may be given of it, why students should be more subject to
this malady than others. The one is, they live a sedentary, solitary life,
<span lang="la">sibi et musis</span>, free from bodily exercise, and those ordinary disports
which other men use: and many times if discontent and idleness concur with
it, which is too frequent, they are precipitated into this gulf on a
sudden: but the common cause is overmuch study; too much learning (as
<a href="#note1978">[1978]</a>Festus told Paul) hath made thee mad; 'tis that other extreme which
effects it. So did Trincavelius, <span class="cite">lib. 1, consil. 12 and 13</span>, find by his
experience, in two of his patients, a young baron, and another that
contracted this malady by too vehement study. So Forestus, <span class="cite">observat. l.
10, observ. 13</span>, in a young divine in Louvain, that was mad, and said
<a href="#note1979">[1979]</a><q>he had a Bible in his head:</q> Marsilius Ficinus <span class="cite">de sanit. tuend.
lib. 1, cap. 1, 3, 4</span>, and <span class="cite">lib. 2, cap. 16</span>, gives many reasons, <a href="#note1980">[1980]</a>
<q>why students dote more often than others.</q> The first is their negligence;
<a href="#note1981">[1981]</a><q>other men look to their tools, a painter will wash his pencils, a
smith will look to his hammer, anvil, forge; a husbandman will mend his
plough-irons, and grind his hatchet if it be dull; a falconer or huntsman
will have an especial care of his hawks, hounds, horses, dogs, &amp;c.; a
musician will string and unstring his lute, &amp;c.; only scholars neglect that
instrument, their brain and spirits (I mean) which they daily use, and by
which they range overall the world, which by much study is consumed.</q>
<span lang="la">Vide</span> (saith Lucian) <span lang="la">ne funiculum nimis intendendo aliquando abrumpas</span>:
<q>See thou twist not the rope so hard, till at length it <a href="#note1982">[1982]</a>break.</q>
Facinus in his fourth chap. gives some other reasons; Saturn and Mercury,
the patrons of learning, they are both dry planets: and Origanus assigns
the same cause, why Mercurialists are so poor, and most part beggars; for
that their president Mercury had no better fortune himself. The destinies
of old put poverty upon him as a punishment; since when, poetry and beggary
are Gemelli, twin-born brats, inseparable companions;
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1983">[1983]</a>And to this day is every scholar poor;</div>
<div class="line">Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor:</div>
</div>
Mercury can help them to knowledge, but not to money. The second is
contemplation, <a href="#note1984">[1984]</a><q>which dries the brain and extinguisheth natural
heat; for whilst the spirits are intent to meditation above in the head,
the stomach and liver are left destitute, and thence come black blood and
crudities by defect of concoction, and for want of exercise the superfluous
vapours cannot exhale,</q> &amp;c. The same reasons are repeated by Gomesius,
<span class="cite">lib. 4, cap. 1, de sale</span> <a href="#note1985">[1985]</a>Nymannus <span class="cite">orat. de Imag.</span> Jo.
Voschius, <span class="cite">lib. 2, cap. 5, de peste</span>: and something more they add, that
hard students are commonly troubled with gouts, catarrhs, rheums, cachexia,
bradiopepsia, bad eyes, stone and colic, <a href="#note1986">[1986]</a>crudities, oppilations,
vertigo, winds, consumptions, and all such diseases as come by overmuch
sitting; they are most part lean, dry, ill-coloured, spend their fortunes,
lose their wits, and many times their lives, and all through immoderate
pains, and extraordinary studies. If you will not believe the truth of
this, look upon great Tostatus and Thomas Aquinas's works, and tell me
whether those men took pains? peruse Austin, Hierom, &amp;c., and many
thousands besides.

their own health, wealth, <span lang="la">esse</span> and <span lang="la">bene esse</span>, to gain knowledge for
which, after all their pains, in this world's esteem they are accounted
ridiculous and silly fools, idiots, asses, and (as oft they are) rejected,
contemned, derided, doting, and mad. Look for examples in Hildesheim
<span class="cite">spicel. 2, de mania et delirio</span>: read Trincavellius, <span class="cite">l. 3. consil.
36, et c. 17.</span> Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 233.</span> <a href="#note1988">[1988]</a>Garceus <span class="cite">de Judic. genit.

yet they are esteemed scrubs and fools by reason of their carriage: <q>after

<q>He becomes more silent than a statue, and generally excites people's
laughter.</q> Because they cannot ride a horse, which every clown can do;
salute and court a gentlewoman, carve at table, cringe and make conges,
which every common swasher can do, <a href="#note1990">[1990]</a><span lang="la">hos populus ridet</span>, &amp;c., they
are laughed to scorn, and accounted silly fools by our gallants. Yea, many
times, such is their misery, they deserve it: <a href="#note1991">[1991]</a>a mere scholar, a mere
ass.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note1992">[1992]</a>Obstipo capite, et figentes lumine terram,</div>
<div class="line">Murmura cum secum, et rabiosa silentia rodunt,</div>

<div class="line"><a href="#note1993">[1993]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;who do lean awry</div>
<div class="line">Their heads, piercing the earth with a fixt eye;</div>
<div class="line">When, by themselves, they gnaw their murmuring,</div>
<div class="line">And furious silence, as 'twere balancing</div>
<div class="line">Each word upon their out-stretched lip, and when</div>
<div class="line">They meditate the dreams of old sick men,</div>
<div class="line">As, 'Out of nothing, nothing can be brought;</div>
<div class="line">And that which is, can ne'er be turn'd to nought.'</div>
</div>
Thus they go commonly meditating unto themselves, thus they sit, such is
their action and gesture. Fulgosus, <span class="cite">l. 8, c. 7</span>, makes mention how Th.
Aquinas supping with king Lewis of France, upon a sudden knocked his fist
upon the table, and cried, <span lang="la">conclusum est contra Manichaeos</span>, his wits were
a wool-gathering, as they say, and his head busied about other matters,
when he perceived his error, he was much <a href="#note1994">[1994]</a>abashed. Such a story there
is of Archimedes in Vitruvius, that having found out the means to know how
much gold was mingled with the silver in king Hieron's crown, ran naked
forth of the bath and cried <span lang="gr">&#x1F15;&upsilon;&rho;&eta;&kappa;&alpha;</span>, I have found: <a href="#note1995">[1995]</a><q>and was
commonly so intent to his studies, that he never perceived what was done
about him: when the city was taken, and the soldiers now ready to rifle his
house, he took no notice of it.</q> St. Bernard rode all day long by the
Lemnian lake, and asked at last where he was, Marullus, <span class="cite">lib. 2, cap. 4.</span>
It was Democritus's carriage alone that made the Abderites suppose him to
have been mad, and send for Hippocrates to cure him: if he had been in any
solemn company, he would upon all occasions fall a laughing. Theophrastus
saith as much of Heraclitus, for that he continually wept, and Laertius of
Menedemus Lampsacus, because he ran like a madman, <a href="#note1996">[1996]</a>saying, <q>he came
from hell as a spy, to tell the devils what mortal men did.</q> Your greatest
students are commonly no better, silly, soft fellows in their outward
behaviour, absurd, ridiculous to others, and no whit experienced in worldly
business; they can measure the heavens, range over the world, teach others
wisdom, and yet in bargains and contracts they are circumvented by every
base tradesman. Are not these men fools? and how should they be otherwise,
<q>but as so many sots in schools, when</q> (as <a href="#note1997">[1997]</a>he well observed) <q>they
neither hear nor see such things as are commonly practised abroad?</q> how
should they get experience, by what means? <a href="#note1998">[1998]</a><q>I knew in my time many
scholars,</q> saith Aeneas Sylvius (in an epistle of his to Gasper Scitick,
chancellor to the emperor), <q>excellent well learned, but so rude, so silly,
that they had no common civility, nor knew how to manage their domestic or
public affairs.</q> <q>Paglarensis was amazed, and said his farmer had surely
cozened him, when he heard him tell that his sow had eleven pigs, and his
ass had but one foal.</q> To say the best of this profession, I can give no
other testimony of them in general, than that of Pliny of Isaeus; <a href="#note1999">[1999]</a><q>He
is yet a scholar, than which kind of men there is nothing so simple, so
sincere, none better, they are most part harmless, honest, upright,
innocent, plain-dealing men.</q>

<p>Now because they are commonly subject to such hazards and inconveniences as
dotage, madness, simplicity, &amp;c. Jo. Voschius would have good scholars to
be highly rewarded, and had in some extraordinary respect above other men,
<q>to have greater <a href="#note2000">[2000]</a>privileges than the rest, that adventure themselves
and abbreviate their lives for the public good.</q> But our patrons of
learning are so far nowadays from respecting the muses, and giving that
honour to scholars, or reward which they deserve, and are allowed by those
indulgent privileges of many noble princes, that after all their pains
taken in the universities, cost and charge, expenses, irksome hours,
laborious tasks, wearisome days, dangers, hazards, (barred interim from all
pleasures which other men have, mewed up like hawks all their lives) if
they chance to wade through them, they shall in the end be rejected,
contemned, and which is their greatest misery, driven to their shifts,
exposed to want, poverty, and beggary. Their familiar attendants are,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2001">[2001]</a>Pallentes morbi, luctus, curaeque laborque</div>
<div class="line">Et metus, et malesuada fames, et turpis egestas,</div>
<div class="line">Terribiles visu formae&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Grief, labour, care, pale sickness, miseries,</div>
<div class="line">Fear, filthy poverty, hunger that cries,</div>
<div class="line">Terrible monsters to be seen with eyes.</div>
</div>

<p>If there were nothing else to trouble them, the conceit of this alone were
enough to make them all melancholy. Most other trades and professions,
after some seven years' apprenticeship, are enabled by their craft to live
of themselves. A merchant adventures his goods at sea, and though his
hazard be great, yet if one ship return of four, he likely makes a saving
voyage. An husbandman's gains are almost certain; <span lang="la">quibus ipse Jupiter
nocere non potest</span> (whom Jove himself can't harm) ('tis <a href="#note2002">[2002]</a>Cato's
hyperbole, a great husband himself); only scholars methinks are most
uncertain, unrespected, subject to all casualties, and hazards. For first,
not one of a many proves to be a scholar, all are not capable and docile,
<a href="#note2003">[2003]</a><span lang="la">ex omniligno non fit Mercurius</span>: we can make majors and officers
every year, but not scholars: kings can invest knights and barons, as
Sigismund the emperor confessed; universities can give degrees; and <span lang="la">Tu
quod es, e populo quilibet esse potest</span>; but he nor they, nor all the
world, can give learning, make philosophers, artists, orators, poets; we
can soon say, as Seneca well notes, <span lang="la">O virum bonum, o divitem</span>, point at a
rich man, a good, a happy man, a prosperous man, <span lang="la">sumptuose vestitum,
Calamistratum, bene olentem, magno temporis impendio constat haec laudatio,
o virum literarum</span>, but 'tis not so easily performed to find out a learned
man. Learning is not so quickly got, though they may be willing to take
pains, to that end sufficiently informed, and liberally maintained by their
patrons and parents, yet few can compass it. Or if they be docile, yet all
men's wills are not answerable to their wits, they can apprehend, but will
not take pains; they are either seduced by bad companions, <span lang="la">vel in puellam
impingunt, vel in poculum</span> (they fall in with women or wine) and so spend
their time to their friends' grief and their own undoings. Or put case they
be studious, industrious, of ripe wits, and perhaps good capacities, then
how many diseases of body and mind must they encounter? No labour in the
world like unto study. It may be, their temperature will not endure it, but
striving to be excellent to know all, they lose health, wealth, wit, life
and all. Let him yet happily escape all these hazards, <span lang="la">aereis intestinis</span>
with a body of brass, and is now consummate and ripe, he hath profited in
his studies, and proceeded with all applause: after many expenses, he is
fit for preferment, where shall he have it? he is as far to seek it as he
was (after twenty years' standing) at the first day of his coming to the
University. For what course shall he take, being now capable and ready? The
most parable and easy, and about which many are employed, is to teach a
school, turn lecturer or curate, and for that he shall have falconer's
wages, ten pound per annum, and his diet, or some small stipend, so long as
he can please his patron or the parish; if they approve him not (for
usually they do but a year or two) as inconstant, as <a href="#note2004">[2004]</a>they that cried
<q>Hosanna</q> one day, and <q>Crucify him</q> the other; serving-man-like, he must
go look a new master; if they do, what is his reward?

he be a trencher chaplain in a gentleman's house, as it befell <a href="#note2007">[2007]</a>
Euphormio, after some seven years' service, he may perchance have a living
to the halves, or some small rectory with the mother of the maids at
length, a poor kinswoman, or a cracked chambermaid, to have and to hold
during the time of his life. But if he offend his good patron, or displease
his lady mistress in the mean time,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2008">[2008]</a>Ducetur Planta velut ictus ab Hercule Cacus,</div>

</div>
as Hercules did by Cacus, he shall be dragged forth of doors by the heels,
away with him. If he bend his forces to some other studies, with an intent
to be <span lang="la">a secretis</span> to some nobleman, or in such a place with an ambassador,
he shall find that these persons rise like apprentices one under another,
and in so many tradesmen's shops, when the master is dead, the foreman of
the shop commonly steps in his place. Now for poets, rhetoricians,
historians, philosophers, <a href="#note2009">[2009]</a>mathematicians, sophisters, &amp;c.; they are
like grasshoppers, sing they must in summer, and pine in the winter, for
there is no preferment for them. Even so they were at first, if you will
believe that pleasant tale of Socrates, which he told fair Phaedrus under a
plane-tree, at the banks of the river Iseus; about noon when it was hot,
and the grasshoppers made a noise, he took that sweet occasion to tell him
a tale, how grasshoppers were once scholars, musicians, poets, &amp;c., before
the Muses were born, and lived without meat and drink, and for that cause
were turned by Jupiter into grasshoppers. And may be turned again, <span lang="la">In
Tythoni Cicadas, aut Lyciorum ranas</span>, for any reward I see they are like to
have: or else in the mean time, I would they could live, as they did,
without any viaticum, like so many <a href="#note2010">[2010]</a>manucodiatae, those Indian birds
of paradise, as we commonly call them, those I mean that live with the air
and dew of heaven, and need no other food; for being as they are, their
<a href="#note2011">[2011]</a><q>rhetoric only serves them to curse their bad fortunes,</q> and many of
them for want of means are driven to hard shifts; from grasshoppers they
turn humble-bees and wasps, plain parasites, and make the muses, mules, to
satisfy their hunger-starved paunches, and get a meal's meat. To say truth,
'tis the common fortune of most scholars, to be servile and poor, to
complain pitifully, and lay open their wants to their respectless patrons,
as <a href="#note2012">[2012]</a>Cardan doth, as <a href="#note2013">[2013]</a>Xilander and many others: and which is too
common in those dedicatory epistles, for hope of gain, to lie, flatter, and
with hyperbolical eulogiums and commendations, to magnify and extol an
illiterate unworthy idiot, for his excellent virtues, whom they should
rather, as <a href="#note2014">[2014]</a>Machiavel observes, vilify, and rail at downright for his
most notorious villainies and vices. So they prostitute themselves as
fiddlers, or mercenary tradesmen, to serve great men's turns for a small
reward. They are like <a href="#note2015">[2015]</a>Indians, they have store of gold, but know not
the worth of it: for I am of Synesius's opinion, <a href="#note2016">[2016]</a><q>King Hieron got
more by Simonides' acquaintance, than Simonides did by his;</q> they have
their best education, good institution, sole qualification from us, and
when they have done well, their honour and immortality from us: we are the
living tombs, registers, and as so many trumpeters of their fames: what was
Achilles without Homer? Alexander without Arian and Curtius? who had known
the Caesars, but for Suetonius and Dion?

All which our ordinary students, right well perceiving in the universities,
how unprofitable these poetical, mathematical, and philosophical studies
are, how little respected, how few patrons; apply themselves in all haste
to those three commodious professions of law, physic, and divinity, sharing
themselves between them, <a href="#note2022">[2022]</a>rejecting these arts in the mean time,
history, philosophy, philology, or lightly passing them over, as pleasant
toys fitting only table-talk, and to furnish them with discourse. They are
not so behoveful: he that can tell his money hath arithmetic enough: he is
a true geometrician, can measure out a good fortune to himself; a perfect
astrologer, that can cast the rise and fall of others, and mark their
errant motions to his own use. The best optics are, to reflect the beams of
some great man's favour and grace to shine upon him. He is a good engineer
that alone can make an instrument to get preferment. This was the common
tenet and practice of Poland, as Cromerus observed not long since, in the
first book of his history; their universities were generally base, not a
philosopher, a mathematician, an antiquary, &amp;c., to be found of any note
amongst them, because they had no set reward or stipend, but every man
betook himself to divinity, <span lang="la">hoc solum in votis habens, opimum
sacerdotium</span>, a good parsonage was their aim. This was the practice of some
of our near neighbours, as <a href="#note2023">[2023]</a>Lipsius inveighs, <q>they thrust their
children to the study of law and divinity, before they be informed aright,
or capable of such studies.</q> <span lang="la">Scilicet omnibus artibus antistat spes lucri,
et formosior est cumulus auri, quam quicquid Graeci Latinique delirantes
scripserunt. Ex hoc numero deinde veniunt ad gubernacula reipub. intersunt
et praesunt consiliis regum, o pater, o patria</span>? so he complained, and so
may others. For even so we find, to serve a great man, to get an office in
some bishop's court (to practise in some good town) or compass a benefice,
is the mark we shoot at, as being so advantageous, the highway to
preferment.

<p>Although many times, for aught I can see, these men fail as often as the
rest in their projects, and are as usually frustrate of their hopes. For
let him be a doctor of the law, an excellent civilian of good worth, where
shall he practise and expatiate? Their fields are so scant, the civil law
with us so contracted with prohibitions, so few causes, by reason of those
all-devouring municipal laws, <span lang="la">quibus nihil illiteratius</span>, saith <a href="#note2024">[2024]</a>
Erasmus, an illiterate and a barbarous study, (for though they be never so
well learned in it, I can hardly vouchsafe them the name of scholars,
except they be otherwise qualified) and so few courts are left to that
profession, such slender offices, and those commonly to be compassed at
such dear rates, that I know not how an ingenious man should thrive amongst
them. Now for physicians, there are in every village so many mountebanks,
empirics, quacksalvers, Paracelsians, as they call themselves, <span lang="la">Caucifici
et sanicidae</span> so <a href="#note2025">[2025]</a>Clenard terms them, wizards, alchemists, poor
vicars, cast apothecaries, physicians' men, barbers, and good wives,
professing great skill, that I make great doubt how they shall be
maintained, or who shall be their patients. Besides, there are so many of
both sorts, and some of them such harpies, so covetous, so clamorous, so
impudent; and as <a href="#note2026">[2026]</a>he said, litigious idiots,

society, to carry himself with credit in so vile a rout, <span lang="la">scientiae nomen,
tot sumptibus partum et vigiliis, profiteri dispudeat, postquam</span>, &amp;c.

<p>Last of all to come to our divines, the most noble profession and worthy of
double honour, but of all others the most distressed and miserable. If you
will not believe me, hear a brief of it, as it was not many years since
publicly preached at Paul's cross, <a href="#note2029">[2029]</a>by a grave minister then, and now
a reverend bishop of this land: <q>We that are bred up in learning, and
destinated by our parents to this end, we suffer our childhood in the
grammar-school, which Austin calls <span lang="la">magnam tyrannidem, et grave malum</span>, and
compares it to the torments of martyrdom; when we come to the university,
if we live of the college allowance, as Phalaris objected to the Leontines,
<span lang="gr">&pi;&alpha;&nu; &tau;&#x1FF6;&nu; &#x1F10;&nu;&delta;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&sigmaf; &pi;&lambda;&#x1F74;&nu; &lambda;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&#x1F7a; &kappa;&alpha;&#x1F76; &phi;&#x1F79;&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;</span>, needy of all things but
hunger and fear, or if we be maintained but partly by our parents' cost, do
expend in unnecessary maintenance, books and degrees, before we come to any
perfection, five hundred pounds, or a thousand marks. If by this price of
the expense of time, our bodies and spirits, our substance and patrimonies,
we cannot purchase those small rewards, which are ours by law, and the
right of inheritance, a poor parsonage, or a vicarage of 50<i>l.</i> per annum,
but we must pay to the patron for the lease of a life (a spent and out-worn
life) either in annual pension, or above the rate of a copyhold, and that
with the hazard and loss of our souls, by simony and perjury, and the
forfeiture of all our spiritual preferments, in <span lang="la">esse</span> and <span lang="la">posse</span>, both
present and to come. What father after a while will be so improvident to
bring up his son to his great charge, to this necessary beggary? What
Christian will be so irreligious, to bring up his son in that course of
life, which by all probability and necessity, <span lang="la">cogit ad turpia</span>, enforcing
to sin, will entangle him in simony and perjury, when as the poet said,
<span lang="la">Invitatus ad haec aliquis de ponte negabit</span>: a beggar's brat taken from
the bridge where he sits a begging, if he knew the inconvenience, had cause
to refuse it.</q> This being thus, have not we fished fair all this while,
that are initiate divines, to find no better fruits of our labours, <a href="#note2030">[2030]</a>
<span lang="la">hoc est cur palles, cur quis non prandeat hoc est</span>? do we macerate
ourselves for this? Is it for this we rise so early all the year long?
<a href="#note2031">[2031]</a><q>Leaping</q> (as he saith) <q>out of our beds, when we hear the bell ring,
as if we had heard a thunderclap.</q> If this be all the respect, reward and
honour we shall have, <a href="#note2032">[2032]</a><span lang="la">frange leves calamos, et scinde Thalia
libellos</span>: let us give over our books, and betake ourselves to some other
course of life; to what end should we study? <a href="#note2033">[2033]</a><span lang="la">Quid me litterulas
stulti docuere parentes</span>, what did our parents mean to make us scholars, to
be as far to seek of preferment after twenty years' study, as we were at
first: why do we take such pains? <span lang="la">Quid tantum insanis juvat impallescere
chartis</span>? If there be no more hope of reward, no better encouragement, I
say again, <span lang="la">Frange leves calamos, et scinde Thalia libellos</span>; let's turn
soldiers, sell our books, and buy swords, guns, and pikes, or stop bottles
with them, turn our philosopher's gowns, as Cleanthes once did, into
millers' coats, leave all and rather betake ourselves to any other course
of life, than to continue longer in this misery. <a href="#note2034">[2034]</a><span lang="la">Praestat

<p>Yea, but methinks I hear some man except at these words, that though this
be true which I have said of the estate of scholars, and especially of
divines, that it is miserable and distressed at this time, that the church
suffers shipwreck of her goods, and that they have just cause to complain;
there is a fault, but whence proceeds it? If the cause were justly
examined, it would be retorted upon ourselves, if we were cited at that
tribunal of truth, we should be found guilty, and not able to excuse it
That there is a fault among us, I confess, and were there not a buyer,
there would not be a seller; but to him that will consider better of it, it
will more than manifestly appear, that the fountain of these miseries
proceeds from these griping patrons. In accusing them, I do not altogether
excuse us; both are faulty, they and we: yet in my judgment, theirs is the
greater fault, more apparent causes and much to be condemned. For my part,
if it be not with me as I would, or as it should, I do ascribe the cause,
as <a href="#note2035">[2035]</a>Cardan did in the like case; <span lang="la">meo infortunio potius quam illorum
sceleri</span>, to <a href="#note2036">[2036]</a>mine own infelicity rather than their naughtiness:
although I have been baffled in my time by some of them, and have as just
cause to complain as another: or rather indeed to mine own negligence; for
I was ever like that Alexander in <a href="#note2037">[2037]</a>Plutarch, Crassus his tutor in
philosophy, who, though he lived many years familiarly with rich Crassus,
was even as poor when from, (which many wondered at) as when he came first
to him; he never asked, the other never gave him anything; when he
travelled with Crassus he borrowed a hat of him, at his return restored it
again. I have had some such noble friends' acquaintance and scholars, but
most part (common courtesies and ordinary respects excepted) they and I
parted as we met, they gave me as much as I requested, and that was&mdash;And as
Alexander ab Alexandro <span class="cite">Genial. dier. l. 6. c. 16.</span> made answer to
Hieronymus Massainus, that wondered, <span lang="la">quum plures ignavos et ignobiles ad
dignitates et sacerdotia promotos quotidie videret</span>, when other men rose,
still he was in the same state, <span lang="la">eodem tenore et fortuna cui mercedem
laborum studiorumque deberi putaret</span>, whom he thought to deserve as well as
the rest. He made answer, that he was content with his present estate, was
not ambitious, and although <span lang="la">objurgabundus suam segnitiem accusaret, cum
obscurae sortis homines ad sacerdotia et pontificatus evectos</span>, &amp;c., he chid
him for his backwardness, yet he was still the same: and for my part
(though I be not worthy perhaps to carry Alexander's books) yet by some
overweening and well-wishing friends, the like speeches have been used to
me; but I replied still with Alexander, that I had enough, and more
peradventure than I deserved; and with Libanius Sophista, that rather chose
(when honours and offices by the emperor were offered unto him) to be
<span lang="la">talis Sophista, quam tails Magistratus</span>. I had as lief be still Democritus
junior, and <span lang="la">privus privatus, si mihi jam daretur optio, quam talis
fortasse Doctor, talis Dominus.&mdash;Sed quorsum haec</span>? For the rest 'tis on
both sides <span lang="la">facinus detestandum</span>, to buy and sell livings, to detain from
the church, that which God's and men's laws have bestowed on it; but in
them most, and that from the covetousness and ignorance of such as are
interested in this business; I name covetousness in the first place, as the
root of all these mischiefs, which, Achan-like, compels them to commit
sacrilege, and to make simoniacal compacts, (and what not) to their own
ends, <a href="#note2038">[2038]</a>that kindles God's wrath, brings a plague, vengeance, and a
heavy visitation upon themselves and others. Some out of that insatiable
desire of filthy lucre, to be enriched, care not how they come by it <span lang="la">per
fas et nefas</span>, hook or crook, so they have it. And others when they have
with riot and prodigality embezzled their estates, to recover themselves,
make a prey of the church, robbing it, as <a href="#note2039">[2039]</a>Julian the apostate did,
spoil parsons of their revenues (in keeping half back, <a href="#note2040">[2040]</a>as a great
man amongst us observes:) <q>and that maintenance on which they should live:</q>
by means whereof, barbarism is increased, and a great decay of Christian
professors: for who will apply himself to these divine studies, his son, or
friend, when after great pains taken, they shall have nothing whereupon to
live? But with what event do they these things?
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2041">[2041]</a>Opesque totis viribus venamini</div>
<div class="line">At inde messis accidit miserrima.</div>
</div>
They toil and moil, but what reap they? They are commonly unfortunate
families that use it, accursed in their progeny, and, as common experience
evinceth, accursed themselves in all their proceedings. <q>With what face</q> (as
<a href="#note2042">[2042]</a>he quotes out of Aust.) <q>can they expect a blessing or inheritance
from Christ in heaven, that defraud Christ of his inheritance here on
earth?</q> I would all our simoniacal patrons, and such as detain tithes,
would read those judicious tracts of Sir Henry Spelman, and Sir James
Sempill, knights; those late elaborate and learned treatises of Dr.
Tilslye, and Mr. Montague, which they have written of that subject. But
though they should read, it would be to small purpose, <span lang="la">clames licet et
mare coelo Confundas</span>; thunder, lighten, preach hell and damnation, tell
them 'tis a sin, they will not believe it; denounce and terrify, they have
<a href="#note2043">[2043]</a>cauterised consciences, they do not attend, as the enchanted adder,
they stop their ears. Call them base, irreligious, profane, barbarous,
pagans, atheists, epicures, (as some of them surely are) with the bawd in
Plautus, <span lang="la">Euge, optime</span>, they cry and applaud themselves with that miser,
<a href="#note2044">[2044]</a><span lang="la">simul ac nummos contemplor in arca</span>: say what you will, <span lang="la">quocunque
modo rem</span>: as a dog barks at the moon, to no purpose are your sayings: Take
your heaven, let them have money. A base, profane, epicurean, hypocritical
rout: for my part, let them pretend what zeal they will, counterfeit
religion, blear the world's eyes, bombast themselves, and stuff out their
greatness with church spoils, shine like so many peacocks; so cold is my
charity, so defective in this behalf, that I shall never think better of
them, than that they are rotten at core, their bones are full of epicurean
hypocrisy, and atheistical marrow, they are worse than heathens. For as
Dionysius Halicarnassaeus observes, <span class="cite">Antiq. Rom. lib. 7.</span> <a href="#note2045">[2045]</a><span lang="la">Primum
locum</span>, &amp;c. <q>Greeks and Barbarians observe all religious rites, and dare
not break them for fear of offending their gods;</q> but our simoniacal
contractors, our senseless Achans, our stupefied patrons, fear neither God
nor devil, they have evasions for it, it is no sin, or not due <span lang="la">jure
divino</span>, or if a sin, no great sin, &amp;c. And though they be daily punished
for it, and they do manifestly perceive, that as he said, frost and fraud
come to foul ends; yet as <a href="#note2046">[2046]</a>Chrysostom follows it <span lang="la">Nulla ex poena sit
correctio, et quasi adversis malitia hominum provocetur, crescit quotidie
quod puniatur</span>: they are rather worse than better,&mdash;<span lang="la">iram atque animos a
crimine sumunt</span>, and the more they are corrected, the more they offend: but
let them take their course, <a href="#note2047">[2047]</a><span lang="la">Rode caper vites</span>, go on still as they
begin, 'tis no sin, let them rejoice secure, God's vengeance will overtake
them in the end, and these ill-gotten goods, as an eagle's feathers, <a href="#note2048">[2048]</a>
will consume the rest of their substance; it is <a href="#note2049">[2049]</a><span lang="la">aurum Tholosanum</span>,
and will produce no better effects. <a href="#note2050">[2050]</a><q>Let them lay it up safe, and
make their conveyances never so close, lock and shut door,</q> saith
Chrysostom, <q>yet fraud and covetousness, two most violent thieves are still
included, and a little gain evil gotten will subvert the rest of their
goods.</q> The eagle in Aesop, seeing a piece of flesh now ready to be
sacrificed, swept it away with her claws, and carried it to her nest; but
there was a burning coal stuck to it by chance, which unawares consumed her
young ones, nest, and all together. Let our simoniacal church-chopping
patrons, and sacrilegious harpies, look for no better success.

<p>A second cause is ignorance, and from thence contempt, <span lang="la">successit odium in
literas ab ignorantia vulgi</span>; which <a href="#note2051">[2051]</a>Junius well perceived: this
hatred and contempt of learning proceeds out of <a href="#note2052">[2052]</a>ignorance; as they
are themselves barbarous, idiots, dull, illiterate, and proud, so they
esteem of others. <span lang="la">Sint Mecaenates, non deerunt Flacce Marones</span>: Let there
be bountiful patrons, and there will be painful scholars in all sciences.
But when they contemn learning, and think themselves sufficiently
qualified, if they can write and read, scramble at a piece of evidence, or
have so much Latin as that emperor had, <a href="#note2053">[2053]</a><span lang="la">qui nescit dissimulare,
nescit vivere</span>, they are unfit to do their country service, to perform or
undertake any action or employment, which may tend to the good of a
commonwealth, except it be to fight, or to do country justice, with common
sense, which every yeoman can likewise do. And so they bring up their
children, rude as they are themselves, unqualified, untaught, uncivil most
part. <a href="#note2054">[2054]</a><span lang="la">Quis e nostra juventute legitime instituitur literis?
Quis oratores aut Philosophos tangit? quis historiam legit, illam rerum
agendarum quasi animam? praecipitant parentes vota sua</span>, &amp;c. 'twas Lipsius'
complaint to his illiterate countrymen, it may be ours. Now shall these men
judge of a scholar's worth, that have no worth, that know not what belongs
to a student's labours, that cannot distinguish between a true scholar and
a drone? or him that by reason of a voluble tongue, a strong voice, a
pleasing tone, and some trivially polyanthean helps, steals and gleans a
few notes from other men's harvests, and so makes a fairer show, than he
that is truly learned indeed: that thinks it no more to preach, than to
speak, <a href="#note2055">[2055]</a><q>or to run away with an empty cart;</q> as a grave man said: and
thereupon vilify us, and our pains; scorn us, and all learning. <a href="#note2056">[2056]</a>
Because they are rich, and have other means to live, they think it concerns
them not to know, or to trouble themselves with it; a fitter task for
younger brothers, or poor men's sons, to be pen and inkhorn men, pedantical
slaves, and no whit beseeming the calling of a gentleman, as Frenchmen and
Germans commonly do, neglect therefore all human learning, what have they
to do with it? Let mariners learn astronomy; merchants, factors study
arithmetic; surveyors get them geometry; spectacle-makers optics;
land-leapers geography; town-clerks rhetoric, what should he do with a
spade, that hath no ground to dig; or they with learning, that have no use
of it? thus they reason, and are not ashamed to let mariners, apprentices,
and the basest servants, be better qualified than themselves. In former
times, kings, princes, and emperors, were the only scholars, excellent in
all faculties.
Julius Caesar mended the year, and writ his own Commentaries,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2057">[2057]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;media inter prealia semper,</div>
<div class="line">Stellarum coelique plagis, superisque vacavit.</div>
</div>
<a href="#note2058">[2058]</a>Antonius, Adrian, Nero, Seve. Jul. &amp;c. <a href="#note2059">[2059]</a>Michael the emperor,
and Isacius, were so much given to their studies, that no base fellow would
take so much pains: Orion, Perseus, Alphonsus, Ptolomeus, famous
astronomers; Sabor, Mithridates, Lysimachus, admired physicians: Plato's
kings all: Evax, that Arabian prince, a most expert jeweller, and an
exquisite philosopher; the kings of Egypt were priests of old, chosen and
from thence,&mdash;<span lang="la">Idem rex hominum, Phoebique sacerdos</span>: but those heroical
times are past; the Muses are now banished in this bastard age, <span lang="la">ad sordida
tuguriola</span>, to meaner persons, and confined alone almost to universities.
In those days, scholars were highly beloved, <a href="#note2060">[2060]</a>honoured, esteemed; as
old Ennius by Scipio Africanus, Virgil by Augustus; Horace by Meceanas:
princes' companions; dear to them, as Anacreon to Polycrates; Philoxenus to
Dionysius, and highly rewarded. Alexander sent Xenocrates the philosopher
fifty talents, because he was poor, <span lang="la">visu rerum, aut eruditione praestantes
viri, mensis olim regum adhibiti</span>, as Philostratus relates of Adrian and
Lampridius of Alexander Severus: famous clerks came to these princes'
courts, <span lang="la">velut in Lycaeum</span>, as to a university, and were admitted to their
tables, <span lang="la">quasi divum epulis accumbentes</span>; Archilaus, that Macedonian
king, would not willingly sup without Euripides, (amongst the rest he drank
to him at supper one night, and gave him a cup of gold for his pains)
<span lang="la">delectatus poetae suavi sermone</span>; and it was fit it should be so; because
as <a href="#note2061">[2061]</a>Plato in his Protagoras well saith, a good philosopher as much
excels other men, as a great king doth the commons of his country; and
again, <a href="#note2062">[2062]</a><span lang="la">quoniam illis nihil deest, et minime egere solent, et
disciplinas quas profitentur, soli a contemptu vindicare possunt</span>,
they needed not to beg so basely, as they compel <a href="#note2063">[2063]</a>scholars in our
times to complain of poverty, or crouch to a rich chuff for a meal's meat,
but could vindicate themselves, and those arts which they professed. Now
they would and cannot: for it is held by some of them, as an axiom, that to
keep them poor, will make them study; they must be dieted, as horses to a
race, not pampered, <a href="#note2064">[2064]</a><span lang="la">Alendos volunt, non saginandos, ne melioris
mentis flammula extinguatur</span>; a fat bird will not sing, a fat dog cannot
hunt, and so by this depression of theirs <a href="#note2065">[2065]</a>some want means, others
will, all want <a href="#note2066">[2066]</a>encouragement, as being forsaken almost; and
generally contemned. 'Tis an old saying, <span lang="la">Sint Mecaenates, non deerunt
Flacce Marones</span>, and 'tis a true saying still. Yet oftentimes I may not
deny it the main fault is in ourselves. <a name="index4"></a>Our academics too frequently offend
in neglecting patrons, as <a href="#note2067">[2067]</a>Erasmus well taxeth, or making ill choice
of them; <span lang="la">negligimus oblatos aut amplectimur parum aptos</span>, or if we get a
good one, <span lang="la">non studemus mutuis officiis favorem ejus alere</span>, we do not ply
and follow him as we should. <span lang="la">Idem mihi accidit Adolescenti</span> (saith
Erasmus) acknowledging his fault, <span lang="la">et gravissime peccavi</span>, and so may
<a href="#note2068">[2068]</a>I say myself, I have offended in this, and so peradventure have many
others. We did not <span lang="la">spondere magnatum favoribus, qui caeperunt nos
amplecti</span>, apply ourselves with that readiness we should: idleness, love of
liberty, <span lang="la">immodicus amor libertatis effecit ut diu cum perfidis amicis</span>, as
he confesseth, <span lang="la">et pertinaci pauperate colluctarer</span>, bashfulness,
melancholy, timorousness, cause many of us to be too backward and remiss.
So some offend in one extreme, but too many on the other, we are most part
too forward, too solicitous, too ambitious, too impudent; we commonly
complain <span lang="la">deesse Maecenates</span>, of want of encouragement, want of means, when
as the true defect is in our own want of worth, our insufficiency: did
Maecenas take notice of Horace or Virgil till they had shown themselves
first? or had Bavius and Mevius any patrons? <span lang="la">Egregium specimen dent</span>,
saith Erasmus, let them approve themselves worthy first, sufficiently
qualified for learning and manners, before they presume or impudently
intrude and put themselves on great men as too many do, with such base
flattery, parasitical colloguing, such hyperbolical elogies they do usually
insinuate that it is a shame to hear and see. <span lang="la">Immodicae laudes conciliant
invidiam, potius quam laudem</span>, and vain commendations derogate from truth,
and we think in conclusion, <span lang="la">non melius de laudato, pejus de laudante</span>, ill
of both, the commender and commended. So we offend, but the main fault is
in their harshness, defect of patrons. How beloved of old, and how much
respected was Plato to Dionysius? How dear to Alexander was Aristotle,
Demeratus to Philip, Solon to Croesus, Auexarcus and Trebatius to Augustus,
Cassius to Vespasian, Plutarch to Trajan, Seneca to Nero, Simonides to
Hieron? how honoured?
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2069">[2069]</a>Sed haec prius fuere, nunc recondita</div>

</div>
<p>those days are gone; <span lang="la">Et spes, et ratio studiorum in Caesare tantum</span>: <a href="#note2070">[2070]</a>
as he said of old, we may truly say now, he is our amulet, our <a href="#note2071">[2071]</a>sun,
our sole comfort and refuge, our Ptolemy, our common Maecenas, <span lang="la">Jacobus
munificus, Jacobus pacificus, mysta Musarum, Rex Platonicus: Grande decus,
columenque nostrum</span>: a famous scholar himself, and the sole patron, pillar,
and sustainer of learning: but his worth in this kind is so well known,
that as Paterculus of Cato, <span lang="la">Jam ipsum laudare nefas sit</span>: and which <a href="#note2072">[2072]</a>
Pliny to Trajan. <span lang="la">Seria te carmina, honorque aeternus annalium, non haec
brevis et pudenda praedicatio colet</span>. But he is now gone, the sun of ours
set, and yet no night follows, <span lang="la">Sol occubuit, nox nulla sequuta est</span>. We
have such another in his room, <a href="#note2073">[2073]</a><span lang="la">aureus alter. Avulsus, simili
frondescit virga metallo</span>, and long may he reign and flourish amongst us.

<p>Let me not be malicious, and lie against my genius, I may not deny, but
that we have a sprinkling of our gentry, here and there one, excellently
well learned, like those Fuggeri in Germany; Dubartus, Du Plessis, Sadael,
in France; Picus Mirandula, Schottus, Barotius, in Italy; <span lang="la">Apparent rari
nantes in gurgite vasto</span>. But they are but few in respect of the multitude,
the major part (and some again excepted, that are indifferent) are wholly
bent for hawks and hounds, and carried away many times with intemperate
lust, gaming and drinking. If they read a book at any time (<span lang="la">si quod est
interim otii a venatu, poculis, alea, scortis</span>) 'tis an English Chronicle,
St. Huon of Bordeaux, Amadis de Gaul, &amp;c., a play-book, or some pamphlet of
news, and that at such seasons only, when they cannot stir abroad, to drive
away time, <a href="#note2074">[2074]</a>their sole discourse is dogs, hawks, horses, and what
news? If some one have been a traveller in Italy, or as far as the
emperor's court, wintered in Orleans, and can court his mistress in broken
French, wear his clothes neatly in the newest fashion, sing some choice
outlandish tunes, discourse of lords, ladies, towns, palaces, and cities,
he is complete and to be admired: <a href="#note2075">[2075]</a>otherwise he and they are much at
one; no difference between the master and the man, but worshipful titles;
wink and choose betwixt him that sits down (clothes excepted) and him that
holds the trencher behind him: yet these men must be our patrons, our
governors too sometimes, statesmen, magistrates, noble, great, and wise by
inheritance.

<p>Mistake me not (I say again) <span lang="la">Vos o Patritius sanguis</span>, you that are worthy
senators, gentlemen, I honour your names and persons, and with all
submissiveness, prostrate myself to your censure and service. There are
amongst you, I do ingenuously confess, many well-deserving patrons, and
true patriots, of my knowledge, besides many hundreds which I never saw, no
doubt, or heard of, pillars of our commonwealth, <a href="#note2076">[2076]</a>whose worth,
bounty, learning, forwardness, true zeal in religion, and good esteem of
all scholars, ought to be consecrated to all posterity; but of your rank,
there are a debauched, corrupt, covetous, illiterate crew again, no better
than stocks, <span lang="la">merum pecus (testor Deum, non mihi videri dignos ingenui
hominis appellatione)</span> barbarous Thracians, <span lang="la">et quis ille thrax qui hoc
neget</span>? a sordid, profane, pernicious company, irreligious, impudent and
stupid, I know not what epithets to give them, enemies to learning,
confounders of the church, and the ruin of a commonwealth; patrons they are
by right of inheritance, and put in trust freely to dispose of such livings
to the church's good; but (hard taskmasters they prove) they take away
their straw, and compel them to make their number of brick: they commonly
respect their own ends, commodity is the steer of all their actions, and
him they present in conclusion, as a man of greatest gifts, that will give
most; no penny, <a href="#note2077">[2077]</a>no paternoster, as the saying is. <span lang="la">Nisi preces auro
fulcias, amplius irritas: ut Cerberus offa</span>, their attendants and officers
must be bribed, feed, and made, as Cerberus is with a sop by him that goes
to hell. It was an old saying, <span lang="la">Omnia Romae venalia</span> (all things are venal
at Rome,) 'tis a rag of Popery, which will never be rooted out, there is no
hope, no good to be done without money. A clerk may offer himself, approve
his <a href="#note2078">[2078]</a>worth, learning, honesty, religion, zeal, they will commend him
for it; but <a href="#note2079">[2079]</a><span lang="la">probitas laudatur et alget</span>. If he be a man of
extraordinary parts, they will flock afar off to hear him, as they did in
Apuleius, to see Psyche: <span lang="la">multi mortales confluebant ad videndum saeculi
decus, speculum gloriosum, laudatur ab omnibus, spectatur ob omnibus, nec
quisquam non rex, non regius, cupidus ejus nuptiarium petitor accedit;
mirantur quidem divinam formam omnes, sed ut simulacrum fabre politum
mirantur</span>; many mortal men came to see fair Psyche the glory of her age,
they did admire her, commend, desire her for her divine beauty, and gaze
upon her; but as on a picture; none would marry her, <span lang="la">quod indotato</span>, fair
Psyche had no money. <a href="#note2080">[2080]</a>So they do by learning;

<div class="poem">
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">Your rich men have now learn'd of latter days</div>

<div class="line">As children do a peacock's feather.</div>

</div>
He shall have all the good words that may be given, <a href="#note2082">[2082]</a>a proper man,
and 'tis pity he hath no preferment, all good wishes, but inexorable,
indurate as he is, he will not prefer him, though it be in his power,
because he is <span lang="la">indotatus</span>, he hath no money. Or if he do give him
entertainment, let him be never so well qualified, plead affinity,
consanguinity, sufficiency, he shall serve seven years, as Jacob did for
Rachel, before he shall have it. <a href="#note2083">[2083]</a>If he will enter at first, he must
get in at that Simoniacal gate, come off soundly, and put in good security
to perform all covenants, else he will not deal with, or admit him. But if
some poor scholar, some parson chaff, will offer himself; some trencher
chaplain, that will take it to the halves, thirds, or accepts of what he
will give, he is welcome; be conformable, preach as he will have him, he
likes him before a million of others; for the host is always best cheap:
and then as Hierom said to Cromatius, <span lang="la">patella dignum operculum</span>, such a
patron, such a clerk; the cure is well supplied, and all parties pleased.
So that is still verified in our age, which <a href="#note2084">[2084]</a>Chrysostom complained of
in his time, <span lang="la">Qui opulentiores sunt, in ordinem parasitorum cogunt eos, et
ipsos tanquam canes ad mensas suas enutriunt, eorumque impudentes. Venires
iniquarum coenarum reliquiis differtiunt, iisdem pro arbitro abulentes</span>:
Rich men keep these lecturers, and fawning parasites, like so many dogs at
their tables, and filling their hungry guts with the offals of their meat,
they abuse them at their pleasure, and make them say what they propose.
<a href="#note2085">[2085]</a><q>As children do by a bird or a butterfly in a string, pull in and
let him out as they list, do they by their trencher chaplains, prescribe,
command their wits, let in and out as to them it seems best.</q> If the patron
be precise, so must his chaplain be; if he be papistical, his clerk must be
so too, or else be turned out. These are those clerks which serve the turn,
whom they commonly entertain, and present to church livings, whilst in the
meantime we that are University men, like so many hidebound calves in a
pasture, tarry out our time, wither away as a flower ungathered in a
garden, and are never used; or as so many candles, illuminate ourselves
alone, obscuring one another's light, and are not discerned here at all,
the least of which, translated to a dark room, or to some country benefice,
where it might shine apart, would give a fair light, and be seen over all.
Whilst we lie waiting here as those sick men did at the Pool of <a href="#note2086">[2086]</a>
Bethesda, till the Angel stirred the water, expecting a good hour, they
step between, and beguile us of our preferment. I have not yet said, if
after long expectation, much expense, travel, earnest suit of ourselves and
friends, we obtain a small benefice at last; our misery begins afresh, we
are suddenly encountered with the flesh, world, and devil, with a new
onset; we change a quiet life for an ocean of troubles, we come to a
ruinous house, which before it be habitable, must be necessarily to our
great damage repaired; we are compelled to sue for dilapidations, or else
sued ourselves, and scarce yet settled, we are called upon for our
predecessor's arrearages; first-fruits, tenths, subsidies, are instantly to
be paid, benevolence, procurations, &amp;c., and which is most to be feared, we
light upon a cracked title, as it befell Clenard of Brabant, for his
rectory, and charge of his <span lang="la">Beginae</span>; he was no sooner inducted, but
instantly sued, <span lang="la">cepimusque</span> <a href="#note2087">[2087]</a>(saith he) <span lang="la">strenue litigare, et
implacabili bello confligere</span>: at length after ten years' suit, as long as
Troy's siege, when he had tired himself, and spent his money, he was fain
to leave all for quietness' sake, and give it up to his adversary. Or else
we are insulted over, and trampled on by domineering officers, fleeced by
those greedy harpies to get more fees; we stand in fear of some precedent
lapse; we fall amongst refractory, seditious sectaries, peevish puritans,
perverse papists, a lascivious rout of atheistical Epicures, that will not
be reformed, or some litigious people (those wild beasts of Ephesus must be
fought with) that will not pay their dues without much repining, or
compelled by long suit; <span lang="la">Laici clericis oppido infesti</span>, an old axiom, all
they think well gotten that is had from the church, and by such uncivil,
harsh dealings, they make their poor minister weary of his place, if not
his life; and put case they be quiet honest men, make the best of it, as
often it falls out, from a polite and terse academic, he must turn rustic,
rude, melancholise alone, learn to forget, or else, as many do, become
maltsters, graziers, chapmen, &amp;c. (now banished from the academy, all
commerce of the muses, and confined to a country village, as Ovid was from
Rome to Pontus), and daily converse with a company of idiots and clowns.

<h4><a name="1.2.4.1"></a>SUBSECT. I&mdash;<i>Non-necessary, remote, outward, adventitious, or accidental causes: as first from the Nurse</i>.</h4>

<p>Of those remote, outward, ambient, necessary causes, I have sufficiently
discoursed in the precedent member, the non-necessary follow; of which,
saith <a href="#note2104">[2104]</a>Fuchsius, no art can be made, by reason of their uncertainty,
casualty, and multitude; so called <q>not necessary</q> because according to
<a href="#note2105">[2105]</a>Fernelius, <q>they may be avoided, and used without necessity.</q> Many
of these accidental causes, which I shall entreat of here, might have well
been reduced to the former, because they cannot be avoided, but fatally
happen to us, though accidentally, and unawares, at some time or other; the
rest are contingent and inevitable, and more properly inserted in this rank
of causes. To reckon up all is a thing impossible; of some therefore most
remarkable of these contingent causes which produce melancholy, I will
briefly speak and in their order.

<p>From a child's nativity, the first ill accident that can likely befall him
in this kind is a bad nurse, by whose means alone he may be tainted with
this <a href="#note2106">[2106]</a>malady from his cradle, Aulus Gellius <span class="cite">l. 12. c. 1.</span> brings
in Phavorinus, that eloquent philosopher, proving this at large, <a href="#note2107">[2107]</a>
<q>that there is the same virtue and property in the milk as in the seed, and
not in men alone, but in all other creatures; he gives instance in a kid
and lamb, if either of them suck of the other's milk, the lamb of the
goat's, or the kid of the ewe's, the wool of the one will be hard, and the
hair of the other soft.</q> Giraldus Cambrensis <span class="cite">Itinerar. Cambriae, l. 1.
c. 2.</span> confirms this by a notable example which happened in his time. A
sow-pig by chance sucked a brach, and when she was grown <a href="#note2108">[2108]</a><q>would
miraculously hunt all manner of deer, and that as well, or rather better,
than any ordinary hound.</q> His conclusion is, <a href="#note2109">[2109]</a><q>that men and beasts
participate of her nature and conditions by whose milk they are fed.</q>
Phavorinus urges it farther, and demonstrates it more evidently, that if a
nurse be <a href="#note2110">[2110]</a><q>misshapen, unchaste, dishonest, impudent, <a href="#note2111">[2111]</a>cruel, or
the like, the child that sucks upon her breast will be so too;</q> all other
affections of the mind and diseases are almost engrafted, as it were, and
imprinted into the temperature of the infant, by the nurse's milk; as pox,
leprosy, melancholy, &amp;c. Cato for some such reason would make his servants'
children suck upon his wife's breast, because by that means they would love
him and his the better, and in all likelihood agree with them. A more
evident example that the minds are altered by milk cannot be given, than
that of <a href="#note2112">[2112]</a>Dion, which he relates of Caligula's cruelty; it could
neither be imputed to father nor mother, but to his cruel nurse alone, that
anointed her paps with blood still when he sucked, which made him such a
murderer, and to express her cruelty to a hair: and that of Tiberius, who
was a common drunkard, because his nurse was such a one. <span lang="la">Et si delira
fuerit</span> (<a href="#note2113">[2113]</a>one observes) <span lang="la">infantulum delirum faciet</span>, if she be a fool
or dolt, the child she nurseth will take after her, or otherwise be
misaffected; which Franciscus Barbarus <span class="cite">l. 2. c. ult. de re uxoria</span>
proves at full, and Ant. Guivarra, <span class="cite">lib. 2. de Marco Aurelio</span>: the child
will surely participate. For bodily sickness there is no doubt to be made.
Titus, Vespasian's son, was therefore sickly, because the nurse was so,
Lampridius. And if we may believe physicians, many times children catch the
pox from a bad nurse, Botaldus <span class="cite">cap. 61. de lue vener.</span> Besides evil
attendance, negligence, and many gross inconveniences, which are incident
to nurses, much danger may so come to the child. <a href="#note2114">[2114]</a>For these causes
Aristotle <span class="cite">Polit. lib. 7. c. 17.</span> Phavorinus and Marcus Aurelius would
not have a child put to nurse at all, but every mother to bring up her own,
of what condition soever she be; for a sound and able mother to put out her
child to nurse, is <span lang="la">naturae intemperies</span>, so <a href="#note2115">[2115]</a>Guatso calls it, 'tis fit
therefore she should be nurse herself; the mother will be more careful,
loving, and attendant, than any servile woman, or such hired creatures;
this all the world acknowledgeth, <span lang="la">convenientissimum est</span> (as Rod. a Castro
<span class="cite">de nat. mulierum. lib. 4. c. 12.</span> in many words confesseth) <span lang="la">matrem ipsam
lactare infantem</span>, <q>It is most fit that the mother should suckle her own
infant</q>&mdash;who denies that it should be so?&mdash;and which some women most
curiously observe; amongst the rest, <a href="#note2116">[2116]</a>that queen of France, a
Spaniard by birth, that was so precise and zealous in this behalf, that
when in her absence a strange nurse had suckled her child, she was never
quiet till she had made the infant vomit it up again. But she was too
jealous. If it be so, as many times it is, they must be put forth, the
mother be not fit or well able to be a nurse, I would then advise such
mothers, as <a href="#note2117">[2117]</a>Plutarch doth in his book <span class="cite">de liberis educandis</span> and
<a href="#note2118">[2118]</a>S. Hierom, <span class="cite">li. 2. epist. 27. Laetae de institut. fil. Magninus
part 2. Reg. sanit. cap. 7.</span> and the said Rodericus, that they make
choice of a sound woman, of a good complexion, honest, free from bodily
diseases, if it be possible, all passions and perturbations of the mind, as
sorrow, fear, grief, <a href="#note2119">[2119]</a>folly, melancholy. For such passions corrupt
the milk, and alter the temperature of the child, which now being <a href="#note2120">[2120]</a>
<span lang="la">Udum et molle lutum</span>, <q>a moist and soft clay,</q> is easily seasoned and
perverted. And if such a nurse may be found out, that will be diligent and
careful withal, let Phavorinus and M. Aurelius plead how they can against
it, I had rather accept of her in some cases than the mother herself, and
which Bonacialus the physician, Nic. Biesius the politician, <span class="cite">lib. 4. de
repub. cap. 8.</span> approves, <a href="#note2121">[2121]</a><q>Some nurses are much to be preferred to
some mothers.</q> For why may not the mother be naught, a peevish drunken
flirt, a waspish choleric slut, a crazed piece, a fool (as many mothers
are), unsound as soon as the nurse? There is more choice of nurses than
mothers; and therefore except the mother be most virtuous, staid, a woman
of excellent good parts, and of a sound complexion, I would have all
children in such cases committed to discreet strangers. And 'tis the only
way; as by marriage they are engrafted to other families to alter the
breed, or if anything be amiss in the mother, as Ludovicus Mercatus
contends, <span class="cite">Tom. 2. lib. de morb. haered.</span> to prevent diseases and future
maladies, to correct and qualify the child's ill-disposed temperature,
which he had from his parents. This is an excellent remedy, if good choice
be made of such a nurse.

<h4><a name="1.2.4.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Education a Cause of Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>Education, of these accidental causes of melancholy, may justly challenge
the next place, for if a man escape a bad nurse, he may be undone by evil
bringing up. <a href="#note2122">[2122]</a>Jason Pratensis puts this of education for a principal
cause; bad parents, stepmothers, tutors, masters, teachers, too rigorous,
too severe, too remiss or indulgent on the other side, are often fountains
and furtherers of this disease. Parents and such as have the tuition and
oversight of children, offend many times in that they are too stern, always
threatening, chiding, brawling, whipping, or striking; by means of which
their poor children are so disheartened and cowed, that they never after
have any courage, a merry hour in their lives, or take pleasure in
anything. There is a great moderation to be had in such things, as matters
of so great moment to the making or marring of a child. Some fright their
children with beggars, bugbears, and hobgoblins, if they cry, or be
otherwise unruly: but they are much to blame in it, many times, saith
Lavater, <span class="cite">de spectris, part. 1, cap. 5.</span> <span lang="la">ex metu in morbos graves
incidunt et noctu dormientes clamant</span>, for fear they fall into many
diseases, and cry out in their sleep, and are much the worse for it all
their lives: these things ought not at all, or to be sparingly done, and
upon just occasion. Tyrannical, impatient, hair-brain schoolmasters, <span lang="la">aridi
magistri</span>, so <a href="#note2123">[2123]</a>Fabius terms them, <span lang="la">Ajaces flagelliferi</span>, are in this
kind as bad as hangmen and executioners, they make many children endure a
martyrdom all the while they are at school, with bad diet, if they board in
their houses, too much severity and ill-usage, they quite pervert their
temperature of body and mind: still chiding, railing, frowning, lashing,
tasking, keeping, that they are <span lang="la">fracti animis</span>, moped many times, weary of
their lives, <a href="#note2124">[2124]</a><span lang="la">nimia severitate deficiunt et desperant</span>, and think no
slavery in the world (as once I did myself) like to that of a grammar
scholar. <span lang="la">Praeceptorum ineptiis discruciantur ingenia puerorum</span>, <a href="#note2125">[2125]</a>
saith Erasmus, they tremble at his voice, looks, coming in. St. Austin, in
the first book of his <span class="cite">confess. et 4 ca.</span> calls this schooling <span lang="la">meliculosam
necessitatem</span>, and elsewhere a martyrdom, and confesseth of himself, how
cruelly he was tortured in mind for learning Greek, <span lang="la">nulla verba noveram,
et saevis terroribus et poenis, ut nossem, instabatur mihi vehementer</span>, I
know nothing, and with cruel terrors and punishment I was daily compelled.
<a href="#note2126">[2126]</a>Beza complains in like case of a rigorous schoolmaster in Paris,
that made him by his continual thunder and threats once in a mind to drown
himself, had he not met by the way with an uncle of his that vindicated him
from that misery for the time, by taking him to his house. Trincavellius,
<span class="cite">lib. 1. consil. 16.</span> had a patient nineteen years of age, extremely
melancholy, <span lang="la">ob nimium studium, Tarvitii et praeceptoris minas</span>, by reason
of overmuch study, and his <a href="#note2127">[2127]</a>tutor's threats. Many masters are
hard-hearted, and bitter to their servants, and by that means do so deject,
with terrible speeches and hard usage so crucify them, that they become
desperate, and can never be recalled.

<p>Others again, in that opposite extreme, do as great harm by their too much
remissness, they give them no bringing up, no calling to busy themselves
about, or to live in, teach them no trade, or set them in any good course;
by means of which their servants, children, scholars, are carried away with
that stream of drunkenness, idleness, gaming, and many such irregular
courses, that in the end they rue it, curse their parents, and mischief
themselves. Too much indulgence causeth the like, <a href="#note2128">[2128]</a><span lang="la">inepta patris
lenitas et facilitas prava</span>, when as Mitio-like, with too much liberty and
too great allowance, they feed their children's humours, let them revel,
wench, riot, swagger, and do what they will themselves, and then punish
them with a noise of musicians;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2129">[2129]</a>Obsonet, potet, oleat unguenta de meo;</div>

<div class="line">Vestem? resarcietur.&mdash;Faciat quod lubet,</div>
<div class="line">Sumat, consumat, perdat, decretum est pati.</div>
</div>
But as Demeo told him, <span lang="la">tu illum corrumpi sinis</span>, your lenity will be his
undoing, <span lang="la">praevidere videor jam diem, illum, quum hic egens profugiet aliquo
militatum</span>, I foresee his ruin. So parents often err, many fond mothers
especially, dote so much upon their children, like <a href="#note2130">[2130]</a>Aesop's ape, till
in the end they crush them to death, <span lang="la">Corporum nutrices animarum novercae</span>,
pampering up their bodies to the undoing of their souls: they will not let
them be <a href="#note2131">[2131]</a>corrected or controlled, but still soothed up in everything
they do, that in conclusion <q>they bring sorrow, shame, heaviness to their
parents</q> (<span class="bibcite">Ecclus. cap. xxx. 8, 9</span>), <q>become wanton, stubborn, wilful, and
disobedient;</q> rude, untaught, headstrong, incorrigible, and graceless;
<q>they love them so foolishly,</q> saith <a href="#note2132">[2132]</a>Cardan, <q>that they rather seem
to hate them, bringing them not up to virtue but injury, not to learning
but to riot, not to sober life and conversation, but to all pleasure and
licentious behaviour.</q> Who is he of so little experience that knows not
this of Fabius to be true? <a href="#note2133">[2133]</a><q>Education is another nature, altering
the mind and will, and I would to God</q> (saith he) <q>we ourselves did not spoil
our children's manners, by our overmuch cockering and nice education, and
weaken the strength of their bodies and minds, that causeth custom, custom
nature,</q> &amp;c. For these causes Plutarch in his book <span class="cite">de lib. educ.</span> and
Hierom. <span class="cite">epist. lib. 1. epist. 17. to Laeta de institut. filiae</span>, gives a
most especial charge to all parents, and many good cautions about bringing
up of children, that they be not committed to indiscreet, passionate,
bedlam tutors, light, giddy-headed, or covetous persons, and spare for no
cost, that they may be well nurtured and taught, it being a matter of so
great consequence. For such parents as do otherwise, Plutarch esteems of
them <a href="#note2134">[2134]</a><q>that are more careful of their shoes than of their feet,</q> that
rate their wealth above their children. And he, saith <a href="#note2135">[2135]</a>Cardan, <q>that
leaves his son to a covetous schoolmaster to be informed, or to a close
Abbey to fast and learn wisdom together, doth no other, than that he be a
learned fool, or a sickly wise man.</q>

<h4><a name="1.2.4.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Terrors and Affrights, Causes of Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>Tully, in the fourth of his Tusculans, distinguishes these terrors which
arise from the apprehension of some terrible object heard or seen, from
other fears, and so doth Patritius <span class="cite">lib. 5. Tit. 4. de regis institut.</span>
Of all fears they are most pernicious and violent, and so suddenly alter
the whole temperature of the body, move the soul and spirits, strike such a
deep impression, that the parties can never be recovered, causing more
grievous and fiercer melancholy, as Felix Plater, <span class="cite">c. 3. de mentis
alienat</span>. <a href="#note2136">[2136]</a>speaks out of his experience, than any inward cause
whatsoever: <q>and imprints itself so forcibly in the spirits, brain,
humours, that if all the mass of blood were let out of the body, it could
hardly be extracted. This horrible kind of melancholy</q> (for so he terms it)
<q>had been often brought before him, and troubles and affrights commonly men
and women, young and old of all sorts.</q> <a href="#note2137">[2137]</a>Hercules de Saxonia calls
this kind of melancholy (<span lang="la">ab agitatione spirituum</span>) by a peculiar name, it
comes from the agitation, motion, contraction, dilatation of spirits, not
from any distemperature of humours, and produceth strong effects. This
terror is most usually caused, as <a href="#note2138">[2138]</a>Plutarch will have, <q>from some
imminent danger, when a terrible object is at hand,</q> heard, seen, or
conceived, <a href="#note2139">[2139]</a><q>truly appearing, or in a <a href="#note2140">[2140]</a>dream:</q> and many times
the more sudden the accident, it is the more violent.

Arthemedorus the grammarian lost his wits by the unexpected sight of a

the reign of Charles IX., was so terrible and fearful, that many ran mad,
some died, great-bellied women were brought to bed before their time,
generally all affrighted aghast. Many lose their wits <a href="#note2143">[2143]</a><q>by the sudden
sight of some spectrum or devil, a thing very common in all ages,</q> saith
Lavater <span class="cite">part 1. cap. 9.</span> as Orestes did at the sight of the Furies,
which appeared to him in black (as <a href="#note2144">[2144]</a>Pausanias records). The Greeks
call them <span lang="gr">&mu;&omicron;&rho;&mu;&omicron;&lambda;&#x1F7B;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span>, which so terrify their souls, or if they
be but affrighted by some counterfeit devils in jest,

</div>
as children in the dark conceive hobgoblins, and are so afraid, they are
the worse for it all their lives. Some by sudden fires, earthquakes,
inundations, or any such dismal objects: Themiscon the physician fell into
a hydrophobia, by seeing one sick of that disease: (Dioscorides <span class="cite">l. 6.
c. 33.</span>) or by the sight of a monster, a carcase, they are disquieted many
months following, and cannot endure the room where a corpse hath been, for
a world would not be alone with a dead man, or lie in that bed many years
after in which a man hath died. At <a href="#note2146">[2146]</a>Basil many little children in the
springtime went to gather flowers in a meadow at the town's end, where a
malefactor hung in gibbets; all gazing at it, one by chance flung a stone,
and made it stir, by which accident, the children affrighted ran away; one
slower than the rest, looking back, and seeing the stirred carcase wag
towards her, cried out it came after, and was so terribly affrighted, that
for many days she could not rest, eat, or sleep, she could not be pacified,
but melancholy, died. <a href="#note2147">[2147]</a>In the same town another child, beyond the
Rhine, saw a grave opened, and upon the sight of a carcase, was so troubled
in mind that she could not be comforted, but a little after departed, and
was buried by it. Platerus <span class="cite">observat. l. 1</span>, a gentlewoman of the same city
saw a fat hog cut up, when the entrails were opened, and a noisome savour
offended her nose, she much misliked, and would not longer abide: a
physician in presence, told her, as that hog, so was she, full of filthy
excrements, and aggravated the matter by some other loathsome instances,
insomuch, this nice gentlewoman apprehended it so deeply, that she fell
forthwith a-vomiting, was so mightily distempered in mind and body, that
with all his art and persuasions, for some months after, he could not
restore her to herself again, she could not forget it, or remove the object
out of her sight, <span lang="la">Idem</span>. Many cannot endure to see a wound opened, but
they are offended: a man executed, or labour of any fearful disease, as
possession, apoplexies, one bewitched; <a href="#note2148">[2148]</a>or if they read by chance of
some terrible thing, the symptoms alone of such a disease, or that which
they dislike, they are instantly troubled in mind, aghast, ready to apply
it to themselves, they are as much disquieted as if they had seen it, or
were so affected themselves. <span lang="la">Hecatas sibi videntur somniare</span>, they dream
and continually think of it. As lamentable effects are caused by such
terrible objects heard, read, or seen, <span lang="la">auditus maximos motus in corpore
facit</span>, as <a href="#note2149">[2149]</a>Plutarch holds, no sense makes greater alteration of body
and mind: sudden speech sometimes, unexpected news, be they good or bad,
<span lang="la">praevisa minus oratio</span>, will move as much, <span lang="la">animum obruere, et de sede sua
dejicere</span>, as a <a href="#note2150">[2150]</a>philosopher observes, will take away our sleep and
appetite, disturb and quite overturn us. Let them bear witness that have
heard those tragical alarms, outcries, hideous noises, which are many times
suddenly heard in the dead of the night by irruption of enemies and
accidental fires, &amp;c., those <a href="#note2151">[2151]</a>panic fears, which often drive men out
of their wits, bereave them of sense, understanding and all, some for a
time, some for their whole lives, they never recover it. The <a href="#note2152">[2152]</a>
Midianites were so affrighted by Gideon's soldiers, they breaking but every
one a pitcher; and <a href="#note2153">[2153]</a>Hannibal's army by such a panic fear was
discomfited at the walls of Rome. Augusta Livia hearing a few tragical
verses recited out of Virgil, <span lang="la">Tu Marcellus eris</span>, &amp;c., fell down dead in a
swoon. Edinus king of Denmark, by a sudden sound which he heard, <a href="#note2154">[2154]</a>
<q>was turned into fury with all his men,</q> Cranzius, <span class="cite">l. 5, Dan. hist.</span> and
Alexander ab Alexandro <span class="cite">l. 3. c. 5.</span> Amatus Lusitanus had a patient, that
by reason of bad tidings became epilepticus, <span class="cite">cen. 2. cura 90</span>, Cardan
<span class="cite">subtil. l. 18</span>, saw one that lost his wits by mistaking of an echo. If one
sense alone can cause such violent commotions of the mind, what may we
think when hearing, sight, and those other senses are all troubled at once?
as by some earthquakes, thunder, lightning, tempests, &amp;c. At Bologna in
Italy, <i>anno</i> 1504, there was such a fearful earthquake about eleven o'clock
in the night (as <a href="#note2155">[2155]</a>Beroaldus in his book <span class="cite">de terrae motu</span>, hath
commended to posterity) that all the city trembled, the people thought the
world was at an end, <span lang="la">actum de mortalibus</span>, such a fearful noise, it made
such a detestable smell, the inhabitants were infinitely affrighted, and
some ran mad. <span lang="la">Audi rem atrocem, et annalibus memorandam</span> (mine author
adds), hear a strange story, and worthy to be chronicled: I had a servant
at the same time called Fulco Argelanus, a bold and proper man, so
grievously terrified with it, that he <a href="#note2156">[2156]</a>was first melancholy, after
doted, at last mad, and made away himself. At <a href="#note2157">[2157]</a>Fuscinum in Japona
<q>there was such an earthquake, and darkness on a sudden, that many men were
offended with headache, many overwhelmed with sorrow and melancholy. At
Meacum whole streets and goodly palaces were overturned at the same time,
and there was such a hideous noise withal, like thunder, and filthy smell,
that their hair stared for fear, and their hearts quaked, men and beasts
were incredibly terrified. In Sacai, another city, the same earthquake was
so terrible unto them, that many were bereft of their senses; and others by
that horrible spectacle so much amazed, that they knew not what they did.</q>
Blasius a Christian, the reporter of the news, was so affrighted for his
part, that though it were two months after, he was scarce his own man,
neither could he drive the remembrance of it out of his mind. Many times,
some years following, they will tremble afresh at the <a href="#note2158">[2158]</a>remembrance or
conceit of such a terrible object, even all their lives long, if mention be
made of it. Cornelius Agrippa relates out of Gulielmus Parisiensis, a story
of one, that after a distasteful purge which a physician had prescribed
unto him, was so much moved, <a href="#note2159">[2159]</a><q>that at the very sight of physic he
would be distempered,</q> though he never so much as smelled to it, the box of
physic long after would give him a purge; nay, the very remembrance of it
did effect it; <a href="#note2160">[2160]</a><q>like travellers and seamen,</q> saith Plutarch, <q>that
when they have been sanded, or dashed on a rock, for ever after fear not
that mischance only, but all such dangers whatsoever.</q>

<h4><a name="1.2.4.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Scoffs, Calumnies, bitter Jests, how they cause Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>It is an old saying, <a href="#note2161">[2161]</a><q>A blow with a word strikes deeper than a blow
with a sword:</q> and many men are as much galled with a calumny, a scurrilous
and bitter jest, a libel, a pasquil, satire, apologue, epigram, stage-play
or the like, as with any misfortune whatsoever. Princes and potentates,
that are otherwise happy, and have all at command, secure and free, <span lang="la">quibus
potentia sceleris impunitatem fecit</span>, are grievously vexed with these
pasquilling libels, and satires: they fear a railing <a href="#note2162">[2162]</a>Aretine, more
than an enemy in the field, which made most princes of his time (as some
relate) <q>allow him a liberal pension, that he should not tax them in his
satires.</q> <a href="#note2163">[2163]</a>The Gods had their Momus, Homer his Zoilus, Achilles his
Thersites, Philip his Demades: the Caesars themselves in Rome were commonly
taunted. There was never wanting a Petronius, a Lucian in those times, nor
will be a Rabelais, an Euphormio, a Boccalinus in ours. Adrian the sixth
pope <a href="#note2164">[2164]</a>was so highly offended, and grievously vexed with pasquillers
at Rome, he gave command that his statue should be demolished and burned,
the ashes flung into the river Tiber, and had done it forthwith, had not
Ludovicus Suessanus, a facete companion, dissuaded him to the contrary, by
telling him, that pasquil's ashes would turn to frogs in the bottom of the
river, and croak worse and louder than before,&mdash;<span lang="la">genus irritabile vatum</span>,
and therefore <a href="#note2165">[2165]</a>Socrates in Plato adviseth all his friends, <q>that
respect their credits, to stand in awe of poets, for they are terrible
fellows, can praise and dispraise as they see cause.</q> <span lang="la">Hinc quam sit
calamus saevior ense patet</span>. The prophet David complains, <span class="bibcite">Psalm cxxiii. 4.</span>
<q>that his soul was full of the mocking of the wealthy, and of the
despitefulness of the proud,</q> and <span class="bibcite">Psalm lv. 4.</span> <q>for the voice of the
wicked, &amp;c., and their hate: his heart trembled within him, and the terrors
of death came upon him; fear and horrible fear,</q> &amp;c., and <span class="bibcite">Psal. lxix. 20.</span>
<q>Rebuke hath broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.</q> Who hath not
like cause to complain, and is not so troubled, that shall fall into the
mouths of such men? for many are of so <a href="#note2166">[2166]</a>petulant a spleen; and have
that figure Sarcasmus so often in their mouths, so bitter, so foolish, as
<a href="#note2167">[2167]</a>Balthazar Castilio notes of them, that <q>they cannot speak, but they
must bite;</q> they had rather lose a friend than a jest; and what company
soever they come in, they will be scoffing, insulting over their inferiors,
especially over such as any way depend upon them, humouring, misusing, or
putting gulleries on some or other till they have made by their humouring
or gulling <a href="#note2168">[2168]</a><span lang="la">ex stulto insanum</span>, a mope or a noddy, and all to make
themselves merry:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2169">[2169]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;dummodo risum</div>
<div class="line">Excutiat sibi; non hic cuiquam parcit amico;</div>
</div>
Friends, neuters, enemies, all are as one, to make a fool a madman, is
their sport, and they have no greater felicity than to scoff and deride
others; they must sacrifice to the god of laughter, with them in <a href="#note2170">[2170]</a>
Apuleius, once a day, or else they shall be melancholy themselves; they
care not how they grind and misuse others, so they may exhilarate their own
persons. Their wits indeed serve them to that sole purpose, to make sport,
to break a scurrile jest, which is <span lang="la">levissimus ingenii fructus</span>, the froth
of wit, as <a href="#note2171">[2171]</a>Tully holds, and for this they are often applauded, in
all other discourse, dry, barren, stramineous, dull and heavy, here lies
their genius, in this they alone excel, please themselves and others. Leo
Decimus, that scoffing pope, as Jovius hath registered in the Fourth book
of his life, took an extraordinary delight in humouring of silly fellows,
and to put gulleries upon them, <a href="#note2172">[2172]</a>by commending some, persuading
others to this or that: he made <span lang="la">ex stolidis stultissimos, et maxime
ridiculos, ex stultis insanos</span>; soft fellows, stark noddies; and such as
were foolish, quite mad before he left them. One memorable example he
recites there, of Tarascomus of Parma, a musician that was so humoured by
Leo Decimus, and Bibiena his second in this business, that he thought
himself to be a man of most excellent skill, (who was indeed a ninny) they
<a href="#note2173">[2173]</a><q>made him set foolish songs, and invent new ridiculous precepts,
which they did highly commend,</q> as to tie his arm that played on the lute,
to make him strike a sweeter stroke, <a href="#note2174">[2174]</a><q>and to pull down the arras
hangings, because the voice would be clearer, by reason of the
reverberation of the wall.</q> In the like manner they persuaded one
Baraballius of Caieta, that he was as good a poet as Petrarch; would have
him to be made a laureate poet, and invite all his friends to his
instalment; and had so possessed the poor man with a conceit of his
excellent poetry, that when some of his more discreet friends told him of
his folly, he was very angry with them, and said <a href="#note2175">[2175]</a><q>they envied his
honour, and prosperity:</q> it was strange (saith Jovius) to see an old man of
60 years, a venerable and grave old man, so gulled. But what cannot such
scoffers do, especially if they find a soft creature, on whom they may
work? nay, to say truth, who is so wise, or so discreet, that may not be
humoured in this kind, especially if some excellent wits shall set upon
him; he that mads others, if he were so humoured, would be as mad himself,
as much grieved and tormented; he might cry with him in the comedy, <span lang="la">Proh
Jupiter tu homo me, adigas ad insaniam</span>. For all is in these things as they
are taken; if he be a silly soul, and do not perceive it, 'tis well, he may
haply make others sport, and be no whit troubled himself; but if he be
apprehensive of his folly, and take it to heart, then it torments him worse
than any lash: a bitter jest, a slander, a calumny, pierceth deeper than
any loss, danger, bodily pain, or injury whatsoever; <span lang="la">leviter enim volat</span>,
(it flies swiftly) as Bernard of an arrow, <span lang="la">sed graviter vulnerat</span>, (but
wounds deeply), especially if it shall proceed from a virulent tongue, <q>it
cuts</q> (saith David) <q>like a two-edged sword. They shoot bitter words as
arrows,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psal. lxiv. 5.</span> <q>And they smote with their tongues,</q> <span class="bibcite">Jer. xviii.
18</span>, and that so hard, that they leave an incurable wound behind them. Many
men are undone by this means, moped, and so dejected, that they are never
to be recovered; and of all other men living, those which are actually
melancholy, or inclined to it, are most sensible, (as being suspicious,
choleric, apt to mistake) and impatient of an injury in that kind: they
aggravate, and so meditate continually of it, that it is a perpetual
corrosive, not to be removed, till time wear it out. Although they
peradventure that so scoff, do it alone in mirth and merriment, and hold it
<span lang="la">optimum aliena frui insania</span>, an excellent thing to enjoy another man's
madness; yet they must know, that it is a mortal sin (as <a href="#note2176">[2176]</a>Thomas
holds) and as the prophet <a href="#note2177">[2177]</a>David denounceth, <q>they that use it, shall
never dwell in God's tabernacle.</q>

<p>Such scurrilous jests, flouts, and sarcasms, therefore, ought not at all to
be used; especially to our betters, to those that are in misery, or any way
distressed: for to such, <span lang="la">aerumnarum incrementa sunt</span>, they multiply grief,
and as <a href="#note2178">[2178]</a>he perceived, <span lang="la">In multis pudor, in multis iracundia</span>, &amp;c.,
many are ashamed, many vexed, angered, and there is no greater cause or
furtherer of melancholy. Martin Cromerus, in the Sixth book of his history,
hath a pretty story to this purpose, of Vladislaus, the second king of
Poland, and Peter Dunnius, earl of Shrine; they had been hunting late, and
were enforced to lodge in a poor cottage. When they went to bed, Vladislaus
told the earl in jest, that his wife lay softer with the abbot of Shrine;
he not able to contain, replied, <span lang="la">Et tua cum Dabesso</span>, and yours with
Dabessus, a gallant young gentleman in the court, whom Christina the queen
loved. <span lang="la">Tetigit id dictum Principis animum</span>, these words of his so galled
the prince, that he was long after <span lang="la">tristis et cogitabundus</span>, very sad and
melancholy for many months; but they were the earl's utter undoing: for
when Christina heard of it, she persecuted him to death. Sophia the
empress, Justinian's wife, broke a bitter jest upon Narsetes the eunuch, a
famous captain then disquieted for an overthrow which he lately had: that
he was fitter for a distaff and to keep women company, than to wield a
sword, or to be general of an army: but it cost her dear, for he so far
distasted it, that he went forthwith to the adverse part, much troubled in
his thoughts, caused the Lombards to rebel, and thence procured many
miseries to the commonwealth. Tiberius the emperor withheld a legacy from
the people of Rome, which his predecessor Augustus had lately given, and
perceiving a fellow round a dead corse in the ear, would needs know
wherefore he did so; the fellow replied, that he wished the departed soul
to signify to Augustus, the commons of Rome were yet unpaid: for this
bitter jest the emperor caused him forthwith to be slain, and carry the
news himself. For this reason, all those that otherwise approve of jests in
some cases, and facete companions, (as who doth not?) let them laugh and be
merry, <span lang="la">rumpantur et illa Codro</span>, 'tis laudable and fit, those yet will by
no means admit them in their companies, that are any way inclined to this
malady: <span lang="la">non jocandum cum iis qui miseri sunt, et aerumnosi</span>, no jesting
with a discontented person. 'Tis Castilio's caveat, <a href="#note2179">[2179]</a>Jo. Pontanus,
and <a href="#note2180">[2180]</a>Galateus, and every good man's.

Comitas is a virtue between rusticity and scurrility, two extremes, as
affability is between flattery and contention, it must not exceed; but be
still accompanied with that <a href="#note2181">[2181]</a><span lang="gr">&#x1F00;&beta;&lambda;&#x1F71;&beta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span> or innocency, <span lang="la">quae

been overseen, or committed a foul fact, yet it is no good manners or
humanity, to upbraid, to hit him in the teeth with his offence, or to scoff
at such a one; 'tis an old axiom, <span lang="la">turpis in reum omnis exprobratio</span>.<a href="#note2182">[2182]</a>
I speak not of such as generally tax vice, Barclay, Gentilis, Erasmus,
Agrippa, Fishcartus, &amp;c., the Varronists and Lucians of our time,
satirists, epigrammists, comedians, apologists, &amp;c., but such as personate,
rail, scoff, calumniate, perstringe by name, or in presence offend;

jests, leave a sting behind them, and ought not to be used.

If these rules could be kept, we should have much more ease and quietness
than we have, less melancholy, whereas on the contrary, we study to misuse
each other, how to sting and gall, like two fighting boors, bending all our
force and wit, friends, fortune, to crucify <a href="#note2186">[2186]</a>one another's souls; by
means of which, there is little content and charity, much virulency,
hatred, malice, and disquietness among us.

<h4><a name="1.2.4.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Loss of Liberty, Servitude, Imprisonment, how they cause Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>To this catalogue of causes, I may well annex loss of liberty, servitude,
or imprisonment, which to some persons is as great a torture as any of the
rest. Though they have all things convenient, sumptuous houses to their
use, fair walks and gardens, delicious bowers, galleries, good fare and
diet, and all things correspondent, yet they are not content, because they
are confined, may not come and go at their pleasure, have and do what they
will, but live <a href="#note2187">[2187]</a><span lang="la">aliena quadra</span>, at another man's table and command.
As it is <a href="#note2188">[2188]</a>in meats so it is in all other things, places, societies,
sports; let them be never so pleasant, commodious, wholesome, so good; yet
<span lang="la">omnium rerum est satietas</span>, there is a loathing satiety of all things. The
children of Israel were tired with manna, it is irksome to them so to live,
as to a bird in his cage, or a dog in his kennel, they are weary of it.
They are happy, it is true, and have all things, to another man's judgment,
that heart can wish, or that they themselves can desire, <span lang="la">bona si sua
norint</span>: yet they loathe it, and are tired with the present: <span lang="la">Est natura
hominum novitatis avida</span>; men's nature is still desirous of news, variety,
delights; and our wandering affections are so irregular in this kind, that
they must change, though it must be to the worst. Bachelors must be
married, and married men would be bachelors; they do not love their own
wives, though otherwise fair, wise, virtuous, and well qualified, because
they are theirs; our present estate is still the worst, we cannot endure
one course of life long, <span lang="la">et quod modo voverat, odit</span>, one calling long,
<span lang="la">esse in honore juvat, mox displicet</span>; one place long, <a href="#note2189">[2189]</a><span lang="la">Romae Tibur

that they are tied to the same still, as a horse in a mill, a dog in a

odious, the world loathsome, and that which crosseth their furious
delights, what? still the same? Marcus Aurelius and Solomon, that had
experience of all worldly delights and pleasure, confessed as much of
themselves; what they most desired, was tedious at last, and that their
lust could never be satisfied, all was vanity and affliction of mind.

<p>Now if it be death itself, another hell, to be glutted with one kind of
sport, dieted with one dish, tied to one place; though they have all things
otherwise as they can desire, and are in heaven to another man's opinion,
what misery and discontent shall they have, that live in slavery, or in
prison itself? <span lang="la">Quod tristius morte, in servitute vivendum</span>, as Hermolaus
told Alexander in <a href="#note2191">[2191]</a>Curtius, worse than death is bondage: <a href="#note2192">[2192]</a><span lang="la">hoc
animo scito omnes fortes, ut mortem servituti anteponant</span>, All brave men at
arms (Tully holds) are so affected. <a href="#note2193">[2193]</a><span lang="la">Equidem ego is sum, qui
servitutem extremum omnium malorum esse arbitror</span>: I am he (saith Boterus)
that account servitude the extremity of misery. And what calamity do they
endure, that live with those hard taskmasters, in gold mines (like those
30,000 <a href="#note2194">[2194]</a>Indian slaves at Potosi, in Peru), tin-mines, lead-mines,
stone-quarries, coal-pits, like so many mouldwarps under ground, condemned
to the galleys, to perpetual drudgery, hunger, thirst, and stripes, without
all hope of delivery? How are those women in Turkey affected, that most
part of the year come not abroad; those Italian and Spanish dames, that are
mewed up like hawks, and locked up by their jealous husbands? how tedious
is it to them that live in stoves and caves half a year together? as in
Iceland, Muscovy, or under the <a href="#note2195">[2195]</a>pole itself, where they have six
months' perpetual night. Nay, what misery and discontent do they endure,
that are in prison? They want all those six non-natural things at once,
good air, good diet, exercise, company, sleep, rest, ease, &amp;c., that are
bound in chains all day long, suffer hunger, and (as <a href="#note2196">[2196]</a>Lucian
describes it) <q>must abide that filthy stink, and rattling of chains,
howlings, pitiful outcries, that prisoners usually make; these things are
not only troublesome, but intolerable.</q> They lie nastily among toads and
frogs in a dark dungeon, in their own dung, in pain of body, in pain of
soul, as Joseph did, <span class="bibcite">Psal. cv. 18</span>, <q>they hurt his feet in the stocks, the
iron entered his soul.</q> They live solitary, alone, sequestered from all
company but heart-eating melancholy; and for want of meat, must eat that
bread of affliction, prey upon themselves. Well might <a href="#note2197">[2197]</a>Arculanus put
long imprisonment for a cause, especially to such as have lived jovially,
in all sensuality and lust, upon a sudden are estranged and debarred from
all manner of pleasures: as were Huniades, Edward, and Richard II.,
Valerian the Emperor, Bajazet the Turk. If it be irksome to miss our
ordinary companions and repast for once a day, or an hour, what shall it be
to lose them for ever? If it be so great a delight to live at liberty, and
to enjoy that variety of objects the world affords; what misery and
discontent must it needs bring to him, that shall now be cast headlong into
that Spanish inquisition, to fall from heaven to hell, to be cubbed up upon
a sudden, how shall he be perplexed, what shall become of him? <a href="#note2198">[2198]</a>
Robert Duke of Normandy being imprisoned by his youngest brother Henry I.,
<span lang="la">ab illo die inconsolabili dolore in carcere contabuit</span>, saith Matthew
Paris, from that day forward pined away with grief. <a href="#note2199">[2199]</a>Jugurtha that
generous captain, <q>brought to Rome in triumph, and after imprisoned,
through anguish of his soul, and melancholy, died.</q> <a href="#note2200">[2200]</a>Roger, Bishop of
Salisbury, the second man from King Stephen (he that built that famous
castle of <a href="#note2201">[2201]</a>Devizes in Wiltshire,) was so tortured in prison with
hunger, and all those calamities accompanying such men, <a href="#note2202">[2202]</a><span lang="la">ut vivere
noluerit, mori nescierit</span>, he would not live, and could not die, between
fear of death, and torments of life. Francis King of France was taken
prisoner by Charles V., <span lang="la">ad mortem fere melancholicus</span>, saith Guicciardini,
melancholy almost to death, and that in an instant. But this is as clear as
the sun, and needs no further illustration.

<h4><a name="1.2.4.6"></a>SUBSECT. VI.&mdash;<i>Poverty and Want, Causes of Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>Poverty and want are so violent oppugners, so unwelcome guests, so much
abhorred of all men, that I may not omit to speak of them apart. Poverty,
although (if considered aright, to a wise, understanding, truly regenerate,
and contented man) it be <span lang="la">donum Dei</span>, a blessed estate, the way to heaven,
as <a href="#note2203">[2203]</a>Chrysostom calls it, God's gift, the mother of modesty, and much
to be preferred before riches (as shall be shown in his <a href="#note2204">[2204]</a>place), yet
as it is esteemed in the world's censure, it is a most odious calling, vile
and base, a severe torture, <span lang="la">summum scelus</span>, a most intolerable burden; we
<a href="#note2205">[2205]</a>shun it all, <span lang="la">cane pejus et angue</span> (worse than a dog or a snake), we
abhor the name of it, <a href="#note2206">[2206]</a><span lang="la">Paupertas fugitur, totoque arcessitur orbe</span>,
as being the fountain of all other miseries, cares, woes, labours, and
grievances whatsoever. To avoid which, we will take any pains,&mdash;<span lang="la">extremos
currit mercator ad Indos</span>, we will leave no haven, no coast, no creek of
the world unsearched, though it be to the hazard of our lives, we will dive
to the bottom of the sea, to the bowels of the earth, <a href="#note2207">[2207]</a>five, six,
seven, eight, nine hundred fathom deep, through all five zones, and both
extremes of heat and cold: we will turn parasites and slaves, prostitute
ourselves, swear and lie, damn our bodies and souls, forsake God, abjure
religion, steal, rob, murder, rather than endure this insufferable yoke of
poverty, which doth so tyrannise, crucify, and generally depress us.

<p>For look into the world, and you shall see men most part esteemed according
to their means, and happy as they are rich: <a href="#note2208">[2208]</a><span lang="la">Ubique tanti quisque
quantum habuit fuit</span>. If he be likely to thrive, and in the way of
preferment, who but he? In the vulgar opinion, if a man be wealthy, no
matter how he gets it, of what parentage, how qualified, how virtuously
endowed, or villainously inclined; let him be a bawd, a gripe, an usurer, a
villain, a pagan, a barbarian, a wretch, <a href="#note2209">[2209]</a>Lucian's tyrant, <q>on whom
you may look with less security than on the sun;</q> so that he be rich (and
liberal withal) he shall be honoured, admired, adored, reverenced, and
highly <a href="#note2210">[2210]</a>magnified. <q>The rich is had in reputation because of his
goods,</q> <span class="bibcite">Eccl. x. 31</span>. He shall be befriended: <q>for riches gather many
friends,</q> <span class="bibcite">Prov. xix. 4</span>,&mdash;<span lang="la">multos numerabit amicos</span>, all <a href="#note2211">[2211]</a>happiness
ebbs and flows with his money. He shall be accounted a gracious lord, a
Mecaenas, a benefactor, a wise, discreet, a proper, a valiant, a fortunate
man, of a generous spirit, <span lang="la">Pullus Jovis, et gallinae, filius albae</span>: a
hopeful, a good man, a virtuous, honest man. <span lang="la">Quando ego ie Junonium
puerum, et matris partum vere aureum</span>, as <a href="#note2212">[2212]</a>Tully said of Octavianus,
while he was adopted Caesar, and an heir <a href="#note2213">[2213]</a>apparent of so great a
monarchy, he was a golden child. All <a href="#note2214">[2214]</a>honour, offices, applause,
grand titles, and turgent epithets are put upon him, <span lang="la">omnes omnia bona
dicere</span>; all men's eyes are upon him, God bless his good worship, his
honour; <a href="#note2215">[2215]</a>every man speaks well of him, every man presents him, seeks
and sues to him for his love, favour, and protection, to serve him, belong
unto him, every man riseth to him, as to Themistocles in the Olympics, if
he speak, as of Herod, <span lang="la">Vox Dei, non hominis</span>, the voice of God, not of
man. All the graces, Veneres, pleasures, elegances attend him, <a href="#note2216">[2216]</a>
golden fortune accompanies and lodgeth with him; and as to those Roman
emperors, is placed in his chamber.

he may sail as he will himself, and temper his estate at his pleasure,
jovial days, splendour and magnificence, sweet music, dainty fare, the good
things, and fat of the land, fine clothes, rich attires, soft beds, down
pillows are at his command, all the world labours for him, thousands of
artificers are his slaves to drudge for him, run, ride, and post for him:
<a href="#note2218">[2218]</a>Divines (for <span lang="la">Pythia Philippisat</span>) lawyers, physicians,

What sport will your honour have? hawking, hunting, fishing, fowling,
bulls, bears, cards, dice, cocks, players, tumblers, fiddlers, jesters,
&amp;c., they are at your good worship's command. Fair houses, gardens,

adolescentulae ad nutum speciosae</span>, wine, wenches, &amp;c. a Turkish paradise, a

sense, yet if he be borne to fortunes (as I have said) <a href="#note2227">[2227]</a><span lang="la">jure

<a href="#note2228">[2228]</a><span lang="la">Nemo nisi dives honore dignus</span> (Ambros. <span class="cite">offic. 21.</span>) none so worthy

money enough and command <a href="#note2229">[2229]</a>kingdoms, provinces, armies, hearts, hands,
and affections; thou shalt have popes, patriarchs to be thy chaplains and
parasites: thou shalt have (Tamerlane-like) kings to draw thy coach, queens
to be thy laundresses, emperors thy footstools, build more towns and cities
than great Alexander, Babel towers, pyramids and Mausolean tombs, &amp;c.
command heaven and earth, and tell the world it is thy vassal, <span lang="la">auro emitur
diadema, argento caelum panditur, denarius philosophum conducit, nummus jus
cogit, obolus literatum pascit, metallum sanitatem conciliat, aes amicos
conglutinat</span>.<a href="#note2230">[2230]</a>And therefore not without good cause, John de Medicis,
that rich Florentine, when he lay upon his death-bed, calling his sons,
Cosmo and Laurence, before him, amongst other sober sayings, repeated this,
<span lang="la">animo quieto digredior, quod vos sanos et divites post me relinquam</span>, <q>It
doth me good to think yet, though I be dying, that I shall leave you, my
children, sound and rich:</q> for wealth sways all. It is not with us, as
amongst those Lacedaemonian senators of Lycurgus in Plutarch, <q>He preferred
that deserved best, was most virtuous and worthy of the place, <a href="#note2231">[2231]</a>not
swiftness, or strength, or wealth, or friends carried it in those days:</q>
but <span lang="la">inter optimos optimus, inter temperantes temperantissimus</span>, the most
temperate and best. We have no aristocracies but in contemplation, all
oligarchies, wherein a few rich men domineer, do what they list, and are
privileged by their greatness. <a href="#note2232">[2232]</a>They may freely trespass, and do as
they please, no man dare accuse them, no not so much as mutter against
them, there is no notice taken of it, they may securely do it, live after
their own laws, and for their money get pardons, indulgences, redeem their
souls from purgatory and hell itself,&mdash;<span lang="la">clausum possidet arca Jovem</span>. Let
them be epicures, or atheists, libertines, Machiavellians, (as they often
are) <a href="#note2233">[2233]</a><span lang="la">Et quamvis perjuris erit, sine gente, cruentus</span>, they may go
to heaven through the eye of a needle, if they will themselves, they may be
canonised for saints, they shall be <a href="#note2234">[2234]</a>honourably interred in Mausolean
tombs, commended by poets, registered in histories, have temples and
statues erected to their names,&mdash;<span lang="la">e manibus illis&mdash;nascentur violae</span>.&mdash;If he
be bountiful in his life, and liberal at his death, he shall have one to
swear, as he did by Claudius the Emperor in Tacitus, he saw his soul go to
heaven, and be miserably lamented at his funeral. <span lang="la">Ambubalarum collegia,
&amp;c. Trimalcionis topanta</span> in Petronius <span lang="la">recta in caelum abiit</span>, went right
to heaven: a, base quean, <a href="#note2235">[2235]</a><q>thou wouldst have scorned once in thy
misery to have a penny from her;</q> and why? <span lang="la">modio nummos metiit</span>, she
measured her money by the bushel. These prerogatives do not usually belong
to rich men, but to such as are most part seeming rich, let him have but a
good <a href="#note2236">[2236]</a>outside, he carries it, and shall be adored for a god, as
<a href="#note2237">[2237]</a>Cyrus was amongst the Persians, <span lang="la">ob splendidum apparatum</span>, for his
gay attires; now most men are esteemed according to their clothes. In our
gullish times, whom you peradventure in modesty would give place to, as
being deceived by his habit, and presuming him some great worshipful man,
believe it, if you shall examine his estate, he will likely be proved a
serving man of no great note, my lady's tailor, his lordship's barber, or
some such gull, a Fastidius Brisk, Sir Petronel Flash, a mere outside. Only
this respect is given him, that wheresoever he comes, he may call for what
he will, and take place by reason of his outward habit.

<p>But on the contrary, if he be poor, <span class="bibcite">Prov. xv. 15</span>, <q>all his days are
miserable,</q> he is under hatches, dejected, rejected and forsaken, poor in
purse, poor in spirit; <a href="#note2238">[2238]</a><span lang="la">prout res nobis fluit, ita et animus se
habet</span>; <a href="#note2239">[2239]</a>money gives life and soul. Though he be honest, wise,
learned, well-deserving, noble by birth, and of excellent good parts; yet
in that he is poor, unlikely to rise, come to honour, office, or good
means, he is contemned, neglected, <span lang="la">frustra sapit, inter literas esurit,
amicus molestus</span>. <a href="#note2240">[2240]</a><q>If he speak, what babbler is this?</q> <span class="bibcite">Ecclus</span>, his
nobility without wealth, is <a href="#note2241">[2241]</a><span lang="la">projecta vilior alga</span>, and he not
esteemed: <span lang="la">nos viles pulli nati infelicibus ovis</span>, if once poor, we are
metamorphosed in an instant, base slaves, villains, and vile drudges;
<a href="#note2242">[2242]</a>for to be poor, is to be a knave, a fool, a wretch, a wicked, an
odious fellow, a common eyesore, say poor and say all; they are born to
labour, to misery, to carry burdens like juments, <span lang="la">pistum stercus comedere</span>
with Ulysses' companions, and as Chremilus objected in Aristophanes, <a href="#note2243">[2243]</a>
<span lang="la">salem lingere</span>, lick salt, to empty jakes, fay channels, <a href="#note2244">[2244]</a>carry out
dirt and dunghills, sweep chimneys, rub horse-heels, &amp;c. I say nothing of
Turks, galley-slaves, which are bought <a href="#note2245">[2245]</a>and sold like juments, or
those African Negroes, or poor <a href="#note2246">[2246]</a>Indian drudges, <span lang="la">qui indies hinc inde
deferendis oneribus occumbunt, nam quod apud nos boves et asini vehunt,
trahunt</span>, &amp;c. <a href="#note2247">[2247]</a><span lang="la">Id omne misellis Indis</span>, they are ugly to behold, and
though erst spruce, now rusty and squalid, because poor, <a href="#note2248">[2248]</a><span lang="la">immundas

thresh. Thus are they commanded, being indeed some of them as so many
footstools for rich men to tread on, blocks for them to get on horseback,
or as <a href="#note2252">[2252]</a><q>walls for them to piss on.</q> They are commonly such people,
rude, silly, superstitious idiots, nasty, unclean, lousy, poor, dejected,
slavishly humble: and as <a href="#note2253">[2253]</a>Leo Afer observes of the commonalty of
Africa, <span lang="la">natura viliores sunt, nec apud suos duces majore in precio quam si
canes essent</span>: <a href="#note2254">[2254]</a>base by nature, and no more esteemed than dogs,
<span lang="la">miseram, laboriosam, calamitosam vitam agunt, et inopem, infelicem,
rudiores asinis, ut e brutis plane natos dicas</span>: no learning, no knowledge,
no civility, scarce common, sense, nought but barbarism amongst them,
<span lang="la">belluino more vivunt, neque calceos gestant, neque vestes</span>, like rogues
and vagabonds, they go barefooted and barelegged, the soles of their feet
being as hard as horse-hoofs, as <a href="#note2255">[2255]</a>Radzivilus observed at Damietta in
Egypt, leading a laborious, miserable, wretched, unhappy life, <a href="#note2256">[2256]</a><q>like
beasts and juments, if not worse:</q> (for a <a href="#note2257">[2257]</a>Spaniard in Incatan, sold
three Indian boys for a cheese, and a hundred Negro slaves for a horse)
their discourse is scurrility, their <span lang="la">summum bonum</span>, a pot of ale. There is
not any slavery which these villains will not undergo, <span lang="la">inter illos
plerique latrinas evacuant, alii culinariam curant, alii stabularios
agunt, urinatores et id genus similia exercent</span>, &amp;c. like those people
that dwell in the <a href="#note2258">[2258]</a>Alps, chimney-sweepers, jakes-farmers,
dirt-daubers, vagrant rogues, they labour hard some, and yet cannot get
clothes to put on, or bread to eat. For what can filthy poverty give else,
but <a href="#note2259">[2259]</a>beggary, fulsome nastiness, squalor, contempt, drudgery, labour,
ugliness, hunger and thirst; <span lang="la">pediculorum, et pulicum numerum</span>? as <a href="#note2260">[2260]</a>
he well followed it in Aristophanes, fleas and lice, <span lang="la">pro pallio vestem
laceram, et pro pulvinari lapidem bene magnum ad caput</span>, rags for his
raiment, and a stone for his pillow, <span lang="la">pro cathedra, ruptae caput urnae</span>, he
sits in a broken pitcher, or on a block for a chair, <span lang="la">et malvae, ramos pro
panibus comedit</span>, he drinks water, and lives on wort leaves, pulse, like a
hog, or scraps like a dog, <span lang="la">ut nunc nobis vita afficitur, quis non putabit
insaniam esse, infelicitatemque</span>? as Chremilus concludes his speech, as we
poor men live nowadays, who will not take our life to be <a href="#note2261">[2261]</a>
infelicity, misery, and madness?

<p>If they be of little better condition than those base villains,
hunger-starved beggars, wandering rogues, those ordinary slaves, and
day-labouring drudges; yet they are commonly so preyed upon by <a href="#note2262">[2262]</a>
polling officers for breaking the laws, by their tyrannising landlords, so
flayed and fleeced by perpetual <a href="#note2263">[2263]</a>exactions, that though they do
drudge, fare hard, and starve their genius, they cannot live in <a href="#note2264">[2264]</a>some
countries; but what they have is instantly taken from them, the very care
they take to live, to be drudges, to maintain their poor families, their
trouble and anxiety <q>takes away their sleep,</q> <span class="bibcite">Sirac. xxxi. 1</span>, it makes them
weary of their lives: when they have taken all pains, done their utmost and
honest endeavours, if they be cast behind by sickness, or overtaken with
years, no man pities them, hard-hearted and merciless, uncharitable as they
are, they leave them so distressed, to beg, steal, murmur, and <a href="#note2265">[2265]</a>
rebel, or else starve. The feeling and fear of this misery compelled those
old Romans, whom Menenius Agrippa pacified, to resist their governors:
outlaws, and rebels in most places, to take up seditious arms, and in all
ages hath caused uproars, murmurings, seditions, rebellions, thefts,
murders, mutinies, jars and contentions in every commonwealth: grudging,
repining, complaining, discontent in each private family, because they want
means to live according to their callings, bring up their children, it
breaks their hearts, they cannot do as they would. No greater misery than
for a lord to have a knight's living, a gentleman a yeoman's, not to be
able to live as his birth and place require. Poverty and want are generally
corrosives to all kinds of men, especially to such as have been in good and
flourishing estate, are suddenly distressed, <a href="#note2266">[2266]</a>nobly born, liberally
brought up, and, by some disaster and casualty miserably dejected. For the
rest, as they have base fortunes, so have they base minds correspondent,
like beetles, <span lang="la">e stercore orti, e stercore victus, in stercore delicium</span>,
as they were obscurely born and bred, so they delight in obscenity; they
are not thoroughly touched with it. <span lang="la">Angustas animas angusto in pectore
versant</span>. <a href="#note2267">[2267]</a>Yet, that which is no small cause of their torments, if
once they come to be in distress, they are forsaken of their fellows, most
part neglected, and left unto themselves; as poor <a href="#note2268">[2268]</a>Terence in Rome
was by Scipio, Laelius, and Furius, his great and noble friends.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

</div>
'Tis generally so, <span lang="la">Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris</span>, he is left cold
and comfortless, <span lang="la">nullas ad amissas ibit amicus opes</span>, all flee from him as
from a rotten wall, now ready to fall on their heads. <span class="bibcite">Prov. xix. 1.</span>

<q>his neighbours hate him,</q> Pro. xiv. 20, <a href="#note2275">[2275]</a><span lang="la">omnes me noti ac ignoti

they must endure <a href="#note2276">[2276]</a>jests, taunts, flouts, blows of their betters, and
take all in good part to get a meal's meat: <a href="#note2277">[2277]</a><span lang="la">magnum pauperies

<a href="#note2280">[2280]</a><span lang="la">potentiorum stultitia perferenda est</span>, and may not so much as
mutter against it. He must turn rogue and villain; for as the saying is,

murderers, traitors, assassins, <q>because of poverty we have sinned,</q> <span class="bibcite">Ecclus.

therefore, calls poverty, <q>thievish, sacrilegious, filthy, wicked, and
mischievous:</q> and well he might. For it makes many an upright man
otherwise, had he not been in want, to take bribes, to be corrupt, to do
against his conscience, to sell his tongue, heart, hand, &amp;c., to be
churlish, hard, unmerciful, uncivil, to use indirect means to help his
present estate. It makes princes to exact upon their subjects, great men
tyrannise, landlords oppress, justice mercenary, lawyers vultures,
physicians harpies, friends importunate, tradesmen liars, honest men
thieves, devout assassins, great men to prostitute their wives, daughters,
and themselves, middle sort to repine, commons to mutiny, all to grudge,
murmur, and complain. A great temptation to all mischief, it compels some
miserable wretches to counterfeit several diseases, to dismember, make
themselves blind, lame, to have a more plausible cause to beg, and lose
their limbs to recover their present wants. Jodocus Damhoderius, a lawyer
of Bruges, <span class="cite">praxi rerum criminal. c. 112.</span> hath some notable examples of
such counterfeit cranks, and every village almost will yield abundant
testimonies amongst us; we have dummerers, Abraham men, &amp;c. And that which
is the extent of misery, it enforceth them through anguish and
wearisomeness of their lives, to make away themselves; they had rather be
hanged, drowned, &amp;c., than to live without means.

A Sybarite of old, as I find it registered in <a href="#note2286">[2286]</a>Athenaeus, supping in
Phiditiis in Sparta, and observing their hard fare, said it was no marvel
if the Lacedaemonians were valiant men; <q>for his part, he would rather run
upon a sword point (and so would any man in his wits,) than live with such
base diet, or lead so wretched a life.</q> <a href="#note2287">[2287]</a>In Japonia, 'tis a common
thing to stifle their children if they be poor, or to make an abortion,
which Aristotle commends. In that civil commonwealth of China, <a href="#note2288">[2288]</a>the
mother strangles her child, if she be not able to bring it up, and had
rather lose, than sell it, or have it endure such misery as poor men do.
Arnobius, <span class="cite">lib. 7, adversus gentes</span>, <a href="#note2289">[2289]</a>Lactantius, <span class="cite">lib. 5. cap. 9.</span>
objects as much to those ancient Greeks and Romans, <q>they did expose their
children to wild beasts, strangle, or knock out their brains against a
stone, in such cases.</q> If we may give credit to <a href="#note2290">[2290]</a>Munster, amongst us
Christians in Lithuania, they voluntarily mancipate and sell themselves,
their wives and children to rich men, to avoid hunger and beggary; <a href="#note2291">[2291]</a>
many make away themselves in this extremity. Apicius the Roman, when he
cast up his accounts, and found but 100,000 crowns left, murdered himself
for fear he should be famished to death. P. Forestus, in his medicinal
observations, hath a memorable example of two brothers of Louvain that,
being destitute of means, became both melancholy, and in a discontented
humour massacred themselves. Another of a merchant, learned, wise otherwise
and discreet, but out of a deep apprehension he had of a loss at seas,
would not be persuaded but as <a href="#note2292">[2292]</a>Ventidius in the poet, he should die a
beggar. In a word, thus much I may conclude of poor men, that though they
have good <a href="#note2293">[2293]</a>parts they cannot show or make use of them: <a href="#note2294">[2294]</a><span lang="la">ab
inopia ad virtutem obsepta est via</span>, 'tis hard for a poor man to <a href="#note2295">[2295]</a>

<a href="#note2296">[2296]</a><q>The wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard.</q>

<q>No verses can please men or live long that are written by water-drinkers.</q>
Poor men cannot please, their actions, counsels, consultations, projects,
are vilified in the world's esteem, <span lang="la">amittunt consilium in re</span>, which
Gnatho long since observed. <a href="#note2297">[2297]</a><span lang="la">Sapiens crepidas sibi nunquam nec

doth he prove it? I am sure we find it otherwise in our days, <a href="#note2298">[2298]</a>
<span lang="la">pruinosis horret facundia pannis</span>. Homer himself must beg if he want
means, and as by report sometimes he did <a href="#note2299">[2299]</a><q>go from door to door, and
sing ballads, with a company of boys about him.</q> This common misery of
theirs must needs distract, make them discontent and melancholy, as
ordinarily they are, wayward, peevish, like a weary traveller, for <a href="#note2300">[2300]</a>
<span lang="la">Fames et mora bilem in nares conciunt</span>, still murmuring and repining: <span lang="la">Ob
inopiam morosi sunt, quibus est male</span>, as Plutarch quotes out of Euripides,
and that comical poet well seconds,

<div class="line">Propter suam impotentiam se credunt negligi.</div>
</div>
<q>If they be in adversity, they are more suspicious and apt to mistake: they
think themselves scorned by reason of their misery:</q> and therefore many
generous spirits in such cases withdraw themselves from all company, as
that comedian <a href="#note2302">[2302]</a>Terence is said to have done; when he perceived
himself to be forsaken and poor, he voluntarily banished himself to
Stymphalus, a base town in Arcadia, and there miserably died.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2303">[2303]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;ad summam inopiam redactus,</div>
<div class="line">Itaque e conspectu omnium abiit Graeciae in terram ultimam.</div>
</div>
Neither is it without cause, for we see men commonly respected according to
their means, (<a href="#note2304">[2304]</a><span lang="la">an dives sit omnes quaerunt, nemo an bonus</span>) and
vilified if they be in bad clothes. <a href="#note2305">[2305]</a>Philophaemen the orator was set
to cut wood, because he was so homely attired, <a href="#note2306">[2306]</a>Terentius was placed
at the lower end of Cecilius' table, because of his homely outside. <a href="#note2307">[2307]</a>
Dante, that famous Italian poet, by reason his clothes were but mean, could
not be admitted to sit down at a feast. Gnatho scorned his old familiar
friend because of his apparel, <a href="#note2308">[2308]</a><span lang="la">Hominem video pannis, annisque
obsitum, hic ego illum contempsi prae me</span>. King Persius overcome sent a
letter to <a href="#note2309">[2309]</a>Paulus Aemilius, the Roman general; Persius P. Consuli. S.
but he scorned him any answer, <span lang="la">tacite exprobrans fortunam suam</span> (saith
mine author) upbraiding him with a present fortune. <a href="#note2310">[2310]</a>Carolus Pugnax,
that great duke of Burgundy, made H. Holland, late duke of Exeter, exiled,
run after his horse like a lackey, and would take no notice of him: <a href="#note2311">[2311]</a>
'tis the common fashion of the world. So that such men as are poor may
justly be discontent, melancholy, and complain of their present misery, and
all may pray with <a href="#note2312">[2312]</a>Solomon, <q>Give me, O Lord, neither riches nor
poverty; feed me with food convenient for me.</q>

<h4><a name="1.2.4.7"></a>SUBSECT. VII.&mdash;<i>A heap of other Accidents causing Melancholy, Death of Friends, Losses, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>In this labyrinth of accidental causes, the farther I wander, the more
intricate I find the passage, <span lang="la">multae ambages</span>, and new causes as so many
by-paths offer themselves to be discussed: to search out all, were an
Herculean work, and fitter for Theseus: I will follow mine intended thread;
and point only at some few of the chiefest.

<p><i>Death of Friends</i>.] Amongst which, loss and death of friends may challenge
a first place, <span lang="la">multi tristantur</span>, as <a href="#note2313">[2313]</a>Vives well observes, <span lang="la">post
delicias, convivia, dies festos</span>, many are melancholy after a feast,
holiday, merry meeting, or some pleasing sport, if they be solitary by
chance, left alone to themselves, without employment, sport, or want their
ordinary companions, some at the departure of friends only whom they shall
shortly see again, weep and howl, and look after them as a cow lows after
her calf, or a child takes on that goes to school after holidays. <span lang="la">Ut me
levarat tuus adventus, sic discessus afflixit</span>, (which <a href="#note2314">[2314]</a>Tully writ
to Atticus) thy coming was not so welcome to me, as thy departure was
harsh. Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 132.</span> makes mention of a country woman that
parting with her friends and native place, became grievously melancholy for
many years; and Trallianus of another, so caused for the absence of her
husband: which is an ordinary passion amongst our good wives, if their
husband tarry out a day longer than his appointed time, or break his hour,
they take on presently with sighs and tears, he is either robbed, or dead,
some mischance or other is surely befallen him, they cannot eat, drink,
sleep, or be quiet in mind, till they see him again. If parting of friends,
absence alone can work such violent effects, what shall death do, when they
must eternally be separated, never in this world to meet again? This is so
grievous a torment for the time, that it takes away their appetite, desire
of life, extinguisheth all delights, it causeth deep sighs and groans,
tears, exclamations,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">(O dulce germen matris, o sanguis meus,</div>
<div class="line">Eheu tepentes, &amp;c.&mdash;o flos tener.)<a href="#note2315">[2315]</a></div>
</div>
howling, roaring, many bitter pangs, <a href="#note2316">[2316]</a><span lang="la">lamentis gemituque et faemineo
ululatu Tecta fremunt</span>) and by frequent meditation extends so far
sometimes, <a href="#note2317">[2317]</a><q>they think they see their dead friends continually in
their eyes,</q> <span lang="la">observantes imagines</span>, as Conciliator confesseth he saw his
mother's ghost presenting herself still before him. <span lang="la">Quod nimis miseri
volunt, hoc facile credunt</span>, still, still, still, that good father, that
good son, that good wife, that dear friend runs in their minds: <span lang="la">Totus
animus hac una cogitatione defixus est</span>, all the year long, as <a href="#note2318">[2318]</a>Pliny
complains to Romanus, <q>methinks I see Virginius, I hear Virginius, I talk
with Virginius,</q> &amp;c.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

<div class="line">Pallentesque rosae, nec dulce rubens hyacinthus,</div>
<div class="line">Nullos nec myrtus, noc laurus spirat odores.</div>
</div>
They that are most staid and patient, are so furiously carried headlong by
the passion of sorrow in this case, that brave discreet men otherwise,
oftentimes forget themselves, and weep like children many months together,
<a href="#note2320">[2320]</a><em>as if that they to water would</em>, and will not be comforted. They
are gone, they are gone; what shall I do?
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Abstulit atra dies et funere mersit acerbo,</div>
<div class="line">Quis dabit in lachrymas fontem mihi? quis satis altos</div>

<div class="line">Exhaurit pietas oculos, et hiantia frangit</div>

<div class="line">Deep sighs sufficient to express my moans?</div>

</div>
So Stroza Filius, that elegant Italian poet, in his Epicedium, bewails his
father's death, he could moderate his passions in other matters, (as he
confesseth) but not in this, lie yields wholly to sorrow,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Nunc fateor do terga malis, mens illa fatiscit,</div>
<div class="line">Indomitus quondam vigor et constantia mentis.</div>
</div>
How doth <a href="#note2321">[2321]</a>Quintilian complain for the loss of his son, to despair
almost: Cardan lament his only child in his book <span class="cite">de libris propriis</span>, and
elsewhere in many of his tracts, <a href="#note2322">[2322]</a>St. Ambrose his brother's death?
<span lang="la">an ego possum non cogitare de te, aut sine lachrymis cogitare? O amari
dies, o flebiles noctes</span>, &amp;c. <q>Can I ever cease to think of thee, and to
think with sorrow? O bitter days, O nights of sorrow,</q> &amp;c. Gregory
Nazianzen, that noble Pulcheria! <span lang="la">O decorem, &amp;c. flos recens, pullulans</span>,
&amp;c. Alexander, a man of most invincible courage, after Hephestion's death,
as Curtius relates, <span lang="la">triduum jacuit ad moriendum obstinatus</span>, lay three
days together upon the ground, obstinate, to die with him, and would
neither eat, drink, nor sleep. The woman that communed with Esdras (<span class="cite">lib.
2. cap. 10.</span>) when her son fell down dead. <q>fled into the field, and would
not return into the city, but there resolved to remain, neither to eat nor
drink, but mourn and fast until she died.</q> <q>Rachel wept for her children,
and would not be comforted because they were not.</q> <span class="bibcite">Matt. ii. 18</span>. So did
Adrian the emperor bewail his Antinous; Hercules, Hylas; Orpheus, Eurydice;
David, Absalom; (O my dear son Absalom) Austin his mother Monica, Niobe her
children, insomuch that the <a href="#note2323">[2323]</a>poets feigned her to be turned into a
stone, as being stupefied through the extremity of grief. <a href="#note2324">[2324]</a><span lang="la">Aegeas,
signo lugubri filii consternatus, in mare se proecipitatem dedit</span>,
impatient of sorrow for his son's death, drowned, himself. Our late
physicians are full of such examples. Montanus <span class="cite">consil. 242.</span> <a href="#note2325">[2325]</a>had a
patient troubled with this infirmity, by reason of her husband's death,
many years together. Trincavellius, <span class="cite">l. 1. c. 14.</span> hath such another,
almost in despair, after his <a href="#note2326">[2326]</a>mother's departure, <span lang="la">ut se ferme
proecipitatem daret</span>; and ready through distraction to make away himself:
and in his Fifteenth counsel, tells a story of one fifty years of age,
<q>that grew desperate upon his mother's death;</q> and cured by Fallopius, fell
many years after into a relapse, by the sudden death of a daughter which he
had, and could never after be recovered. The fury of this passion is so
violent sometimes, that it daunts whole kingdoms and cities. Vespasian's
death was pitifully lamented all over the Roman empire, <span lang="la">totus orbis
lugebat</span>, saith Aurelius Victor. Alexander commanded the battlements of
houses to be pulled down, mules and horses to have their manes shorn off,
and many common soldiers to be slain, to accompany his dear Hephestion's
death; which is now practised amongst the Tartars, when <a href="#note2327">[2327]</a>a great Cham
dieth, ten or twelve thousand must be slain, men and horses, all they meet;
and among those the <a href="#note2328">[2328]</a>Pagan Indians, their wives and servants
voluntarily die with them. Leo Decimus was so much bewailed in Rome after
his departure, that as Jovius gives out, <a href="#note2329">[2329]</a><span lang="la">communis salus, publica
hilaritas</span>, the common safety of all good fellowship, peace, mirth, and
plenty died with him, <span lang="la">tanquam eodem sepulchro cum Leone condita
lugebantur</span>: for it was a golden age whilst he lived, <a href="#note2330">[2330]</a>but after his
decease an iron season succeeded, <span lang="la">barbara vis et foeda vastitas, et dira
malorum omnium incommoda</span>, wars, plagues, vastity, discontent. When
Augustus Caesar died, saith Paterculus, <span lang="la">orbis ruinam timueramus</span>, we were
all afraid, as if heaven had fallen upon our heads. <a href="#note2331">[2331]</a>Budaeus records,
how that, at Lewis the Twelfth his death, <span lang="la">tam subita mutatio, ut qui prius
digito coelum attingere videbantur, nunc humi derepente serpere, sideratos
esse diceres</span>, they that were erst in heaven, upon a sudden, as if they had
been planet-strucken, lay grovelling on the ground;

they looked like cropped trees. <a href="#note2333">[2333]</a>At Nancy in Lorraine, when Claudia
Valesia, Henry the Second French king's sister, and the duke's wife
deceased, the temples for forty days were all shut up, no prayers nor
masses, but in that room where she was. The senators all seen in black,
<q>and for a twelvemonth's space throughout the city, they were forbid to
sing or dance.</q>

</div>
How were we affected here in England for our Titus, <span lang="la">deliciae, humani
generis</span>, Prince Henry's immature death, as if all our dearest friends'
lives had exhaled with his? <a href="#note2335">[2335]</a>Scanderbeg's death was not so much
lamented in Epirus. In a word, as <a href="#note2336">[2336]</a>he saith of Edward the First at
the news of Edward of Caernarvon his son's birth, <span lang="la">immortaliter gavisus</span>,
he was immortally glad, may we say on the contrary of friends' deaths,
<span lang="la">immortaliter gementes</span>, we are diverse of us as so many turtles, eternally
dejected with it.

<p>There is another sorrow, which arises from the loss of temporal goods and
fortunes, which equally afflicts, and may go hand in hand with the
preceding; loss of time, loss of honour, office, of good name, of labour,
frustrate hopes, will much torment; but in my judgment, there is no torture
like unto it, or that sooner procureth this malady and mischief:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2337">[2337]</a>Ploratur lachrymis amissa pecunia veris:</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Lost money is bewailed with grief sincere.</div>
</div>
it wrings true tears from our eyes, many sighs, much sorrow from our
hearts, and often causes habitual melancholy itself, Guianerius <span class="cite">tract.
15. 5.</span> repeats this for an especial cause: <a href="#note2338">[2338]</a><q>Loss of friends, and
loss of goods, make many men melancholy, as I have often seen by continual
meditation of such things.</q> The same causes Arnoldus Villanovanus
inculcates, <span class="cite">Breviar. l. 1. c. 18.</span> <span lang="la">ex rerum amissione, damno, amicorum
morte</span>, &amp;c. Want alone will make a man mad, to be <em>Sans argent</em> will cause
a deep and grievous melancholy. Many persons are affected like <a href="#note2339">[2339]</a>
Irishmen in this behalf, who if they have a good scimitar, had rather have
a blow on their arm, than their weapon hurt: they will sooner lose their
life, than their goods: and the grief that cometh hence, continueth long
(saith <a href="#note2340">[2340]</a>Plater) <q>and out of many dispositions, procureth an habit.</q>
<a href="#note2341">[2341]</a>Montanus and Frisemelica cured a young man of 22 years of age, that
so became melancholy, <span lang="la">ab amissam pecuniam</span>, for a sum of money which he
had unhappily lost. Sckenkius hath such another story of one melancholy,
because he overshot himself, and spent his stock in unnecessary building.
<a href="#note2342">[2342]</a>Roger that rich bishop of Salisbury, <span lang="la">exutus opibus et castris a
Rege Stephano</span>, spoiled of his goods by king Stephen, <span lang="la">vi doloris
absorptus, atque in amentiam versus, indecentia fecit</span>, through grief ran
mad, spoke and did he knew not what. Nothing so familiar, as for men in
such cases, through anguish of mind to make away themselves. A poor fellow
went to hang himself, (which Ausonius hath elegantly expressed in a neat
<a href="#note2343">[2343]</a>Epigram) but finding by chance a pot of money, flung away the rope,
and went merrily home, but he that hid the gold, when he missed it, hanged
himself with that rope which the other man had left, in a discontented
humour.

Such feral accidents can want and penury produce. Be it by suretyship,
shipwreck, fire, spoil and pillage of soldiers, or what loss soever, it
boots not, it will work the like effect, the same desolation in provinces
and cities, as well as private persons. The Romans were miserably dejected
after the battle of Cannae, the men amazed for fear, the stupid women tore
their hair and cried. The Hungarians, when their king Ladislaus and bravest
soldiers were slain by the Turks, <span lang="la">Luctus publicus</span>, &amp;c. The Venetians when
their forces were overcome by the French king Lewis, the French and Spanish
kings, pope, emperor, all conspired against them, at Cambray, the French
herald denounced open war in the senate: <span lang="la">Lauredane Venetorum dux</span>, &amp;c.,
and they had lost Padua, Brixia, Verona, Forum Julii, their territories in
the continent, and had now nothing left, but the city of Venice itself, <span lang="la">et
urbi quoque ipsi</span> (saith <a href="#note2344">[2344]</a>Bembus) <span lang="la">timendum putarent</span>, and the loss
of that was likewise to be feared, <span lang="la">tantus repente dolor omnes tenuit, ut
nunquam, alias</span>, &amp;c., they were pitifully plunged, never before in such
lamentable distress. <i>Anno</i> 1527, when Rome was sacked by Burbonius, the
common soldiers made such spoil, that fair <a href="#note2345">[2345]</a>churches were turned to
stables, old monuments and books made horse-litter, or burned like straw;
relics, costly pictures defaced; altars demolished, rich hangings, carpets,
&amp;c., trampled in the dirt. <a href="#note2346">[2346]</a>Their wives and loveliest daughters
constuprated by every base cullion, as Sejanus' daughter was by the hangman
in public, before their fathers and husbands' faces. Noblemen's children,
and of the wealthiest citizens, reserved for princes' beds, were prostitute
to every common soldier, and kept for concubines; senators and cardinals
themselves dragged along the streets, and put to exquisite torments, to
confess where their money was hid; the rest, murdered on heaps, lay
stinking in the streets; infants' brains dashed out before their mothers'
eyes. A lamentable sight it was to see so goodly a city so suddenly
defaced, rich citizens sent a begging to Venice, Naples, Ancona, &amp;c., that
erst lived in all manner of delights. <a href="#note2347">[2347]</a><q>Those proud palaces that even
now vaunted their tops up to heaven, were dejected as low as hell in an
instant.</q> Whom will not such misery make discontent? Terence the poet
drowned himself (some say) for the loss of his comedies, which suffered
shipwreck. When a poor man hath made many hungry meals, got together a
small sum, which he loseth in an instant; a scholar spent many an hour's
study to no purpose, his labours lost, &amp;c., how should it otherwise be? I
may conclude with Gregory, <span lang="la">temporalium amor, quantum afficit, cum haeret
possessio, tantum quum subtrahitur, urit dolor</span>; riches do not so much
exhilarate us with their possession, as they torment us with their loss.

<p>Next to sorrow still I may annex such accidents as procure fear; for
besides those terrors which I have <a href="#note2348">[2348]</a>before touched, and many other
fears (which are infinite) there is a superstitious fear, one of the three
great causes of fear in Aristotle, commonly caused by prodigies and dismal
accidents, which much trouble many of us, (<span lang="la">Nescio quid animus mihi
praesagit mali.</span>) As if a hare cross the way at our going forth, or a mouse
gnaw our clothes: if they bleed three drops at nose, the salt falls towards
them, a black spot appear in their nails, &amp;c., with many such, which Delrio
<span class="cite">Tom. 2. l. 3. sect. 4.</span> Austin Niphus in his book <span class="cite">de Auguriis.</span> Polydore
Virg. <span class="cite">l. 3. de Prodigas</span>. Sarisburiensis <span class="cite">Polycrat. l. 1. c. 13.</span> discuss at
large. They are so much affected, that with the very strength of
imagination, fear, and the devil's craft, <a href="#note2349">[2349]</a><q>they pull those
misfortunes they suspect, upon their own heads, and that which they fear,
shall come upon them,</q> as Solomon fortelleth, <span class="bibcite">Prov. x. 24.</span> and Isaiah
denounceth, <span class="bibcite">lxvi. 4.</span> which if <a href="#note2350">[2350]</a><q>they could neglect and contemn, would
not come to pass,</q> <span lang="la">Eorum vires nostra resident opinione, ut morbi gravitas
?grotantium cogitatione</span>, they are intended and remitted, as our opinion is
fixed, more or less. <span lang="la">N. N. dat poenas</span>, saith <a href="#note2351">[2351]</a>Crato of such a one,
<span lang="la">utinam non attraheret</span>: he is punished, and is the cause of it <a href="#note2352">[2352]</a>
himself:

<p><a href="#note2353">[2353]</a><span lang="la">Dum fata fugimus fata stulti incurrimus</span>, the thing that I feared,
saith Job, is fallen upon me.

<p>As much we may say of them that are troubled with their fortunes; or ill
destinies foreseen: <span lang="la">multos angit praecientia malorum</span>: The foreknowledge
of what shall come to pass, crucifies many men: foretold by astrologers, or
wizards, <span lang="la">iratum ob coelum</span>, be it ill accident, or death itself: which
often falls out by God's permission; <span lang="la">quia daemonem timent</span> (saith
Chrysostom) <span lang="la">Deus ideo permittit accidere</span>. Severus, Adrian, Domitian, can
testify as much, of whose fear and suspicion, Sueton, Herodian, and the
rest of those writers, tell strange stories in this behalf. <a href="#note2354">[2354]</a>Montanus
<span class="cite">consil. 31.</span> hath one example of a young man, exceeding melancholy upon
this occasion. Such fears have still tormented mortal men in all ages, by
reason of those lying oracles, and juggling priests. <a href="#note2355">[2355]</a>There was a
fountain in Greece, near Ceres' temple in Achaia, where the event of such
diseases was to be known; <q>A glass let down by a thread,</q> &amp;c. Amongst those
Cyanean rocks at the springs of Lycia, was the oracle of Thrixeus Apollo,
<q>where all fortunes were foretold, sickness, health, or what they would
besides:</q> so common people have been always deluded with future events. At
this day, <span lang="la">Metus futurorum maxime torquet Sinas</span>, this foolish fear,
mightily crucifies them in China: as <a href="#note2356">[2356]</a>Matthew Riccius the Jesuit
informeth us, in his commentaries of those countries, of all nations they
are most superstitious, and much tormented in this kind, attributing so
much to their divinators, <span lang="la">ut ipse metus fidem faciat</span>, that fear itself
and conceit, cause it to <a href="#note2357">[2357]</a>fall out: If he foretell sickness such a
day, that very time they will be sick, <span lang="la">vi metus afflicti in aegritudinem
cadunt</span>; and many times die as it is foretold. A true saying, <span lang="la">Timor
mortis, morte pejor</span>, the fear of death is worse than death itself, and the
memory of that sad hour, to some fortunate and rich men, <q>is as bitter as
gall,</q> <span class="bibcite">Eccl. xli. 1.</span> <span lang="la">Inquietam nobis vitam facit mortis metus</span>, a worse
plague cannot happen to a man, than to be so troubled in his mind; 'tis
<span lang="la">triste divortium</span>, a heavy separation, to leave their goods, with so much
labour got, pleasures of the world, which they have so deliciously enjoyed,
friends and companions whom they so dearly loved, all at once. Axicchus the
philosopher was bold and courageous all his life, and gave good precepts
<span lang="la">de contemnenda morte</span>, and against the vanity of the world, to others; but
being now ready to die himself, he was mightily dejected, <span lang="la">hac luce
privabor? his orbabor bonis</span>?<a href="#note2358">[2358]</a>he lamented like a child, &amp;c. And
though Socrates himself was there to comfort him, <span lang="la">ubi pristina virtutum
jactatio O Axioche</span>? <q>where is all your boasted virtue now, my friend?</q> yet
he was very timorous and impatient of death, much troubled in his mind,
<span lang="la">Imbellis pavor et impatientia</span>, &amp;c. <q>O Clotho,</q> Megapetus the tyrant in
Lucian exclaims, now ready to depart, <q>let me live a while longer. <a href="#note2359">[2359]</a>I
will give thee a thousand talents of gold, and two boles besides, which I
took from Cleocritus, worth a hundred talents apiece.</q> <q>Woe's me,</q> <a href="#note2360">[2360]</a>
saith another, <q>what goodly manors shall I leave! what fertile fields! what
a fine house! what pretty children! how many servants! who shall gather my
grapes, my corn? Must I now die so well settled? Leave all, so richly and
well provided? Woe's me, what shall I do?</q> <a href="#note2361">[2361]</a><span lang="la">Animula vagula,
blandula, qua nunc abibis in loca</span>?

<p>To these tortures of fear and sorrow, may well be annexed curiosity, that
irksome, that tyrannising care, <span lang="la">nimia solicitudo</span>, <a href="#note2362">[2362]</a><q>superfluous
industry about unprofitable things, and their qualities,</q> as Thomas defines
it: an itching humour or a kind of longing to see that which is not to be
seen, to do that which ought not to be done, to know that <a href="#note2363">[2363]</a>secret
which should not be known, to eat of the forbidden fruit. We commonly
molest and tire ourselves about things unfit and unnecessary, as Martha
troubled herself to little purpose. Be it in religion, humanity, magic,
philosophy, policy, any action or study, 'tis a needless trouble, a mere
torment. For what else is school divinity, how many doth it puzzle? what
fruitless questions about the Trinity, resurrection, election,
predestination, reprobation, hell-fire, &amp;c., how many shall be saved,
damned? What else is all superstition, but an endless observation of idle
ceremonies, traditions? What is most of our philosophy but a labyrinth of
opinions, idle questions, propositions, metaphysical terms? Socrates,
therefore, held all philosophers, cavillers, and mad men, <span lang="la">circa subtilia
Cavillatores pro insanis habuit, palam eos arguens</span>, saith <a href="#note2364">[2364]</a>Eusebius,
because they commonly sought after such things <span lang="la">quae nec percipi a nobis
neque comprehendi posset</span>, or put case they did understand, yet they were
altogether unprofitable. For what matter is it for us to know how high the
Pleiades are, how far distant Perseus and Cassiopeia from us, how deep the
sea, &amp;c., we are neither wiser, as he follows it, nor modester, nor better,
nor richer, nor stronger for the knowledge of it. <span lang="la">Quod supra nos nihil ad,
nos</span>, I may say the same of those genethliacal studies, what is astrology
but vain elections, predictions? all magic, but a troublesome error, a
pernicious foppery? physic, but intricate rules and prescriptions?
philology, but vain criticisms? logic, needless sophisms? metaphysics
themselves, but intricate subtleties, and fruitless abstractions? alchemy,
but a bundle of errors? to what end are such great tomes? why do we spend
so many years in their studies? Much better to know nothing at all, as
those barbarous Indians are wholly ignorant, than as some of us, to be so
sore vexed about unprofitable toys: <span lang="la">stultus labor est ineptiarum</span>, to
build a house without pins, make a rope of sand, to what end? <span lang="la">cui bono</span>?
He studies on, but as the boy told St. Austin, when I have laved the sea
dry, thou shalt understand the mystery of the Trinity. He makes
observations, keeps times and seasons; and as <a href="#note2365">[2365]</a>Conradus the emperor
would not touch his new bride, till an astrologer had told him a masculine
hour, but with what success? He travels into Europe, Africa, Asia,
searcheth every creek, sea, city, mountain, gulf, to what end? See one
promontory (said Socrates of old), one mountain, one sea, one river, and
see all. An alchemist spends his fortunes to find out the philosopher's
stone forsooth, cure all diseases, make men long-lived, victorious,
fortunate, invisible, and beggars himself, misled by those seducing
impostors (which he shall never attain) to make gold; an antiquary consumes
his treasure and time to scrape up a company of old coins, statues, rules,
edicts, manuscripts, &amp;c., he must know what was done of old in Athens,
Rome, what lodging, diet, houses they had, and have all the present news at
first, though never so remote, before all others, what projects, counsels,
consultations, &amp;c., <span lang="la">quid Juno in aurem insusurret Jovi</span>, what's now
decreed in France, what in Italy: who was he, whence comes he, which way,
whither goes he, &amp;c. Aristotle must find out the motion of Euripus; Pliny
must needs see Vesuvius, but how sped they? One loseth goods, another his
life; Pyrrhus will conquer Africa first, and then Asia: he will be a sole
monarch, a second immortal, a third rich; a fourth commands. <a href="#note2366">[2366]</a>
<span lang="la">Turbine magno spes solicitae in urbibus errant</span>; we run, ride, take
indefatigable pains, all up early, down late, striving to get that which we
had better be without, (Ardelion's busybodies as we are) it were much
fitter for us to be quiet, sit still, and take our ease. His sole study is
for words, that they be&mdash;<span lang="la">Lepidae lexeis compostae, ut tesserulae omnes</span>, not
a syllable misplaced, to set out a stramineous subject: as thine is about
apparel, to follow the fashion, to be terse and polite, 'tis thy sole
business: both with like profit. His only delight is building, he spends
himself to get curious pictures, intricate models and plots, another is
wholly ceremonious about titles, degrees, inscriptions: a third is
over-solicitous about his diet, he must have such and such exquisite
sauces, meat so dressed, so far-fetched, <span lang="la">peregrini aeris volucres</span>, so
cooked, &amp;c., something to provoke thirst, something anon to quench his
thirst. Thus he redeems his appetite with extraordinary charge to his
purse, is seldom pleased with any meal, whilst a trivial stomach useth all
with delight and is never offended. Another must have roses in winter,
<span lang="la">alieni temporis flores</span>, snow-water in summer, fruits before they can be
or are usually ripe, artificial gardens and fishponds on the tops of
houses, all things opposite to the vulgar sort, intricate and rare, or else
they are nothing worth. So busy, nice, curious wits, make that
insupportable in all vocations, trades, actions, employments, which to
duller apprehensions is not offensive, earnestly seeking that which others
so scornfully neglect. Thus through our foolish curiosity do we macerate
ourselves, tire our souls, and run headlong, through our indiscretion,
perverse will, and want of government, into many needless cares, and
troubles, vain expenses, tedious journeys, painful hours; and when all is
done, <span lang="la">quorsum haec? cui bono</span>? to what end?

<p><i>Unfortunate marriage</i>.] Amongst these passions and irksome accidents,
unfortunate marriage may be ranked: a condition of life appointed by God
himself in Paradise, an honourable and happy estate, and as great a
felicity as can befall a man in this world, <a href="#note2368">[2368]</a>if the parties can agree
as they ought, and live as <a href="#note2369">[2369]</a>Seneca lived with his Paulina; but if
they be unequally matched, or at discord, a greater misery cannot be
expected, to have a scold, a slut, a harlot, a fool, a fury or a fiend,
there can be no such plague. <span class="bibcite">Eccles. xxvi. 14</span>, <q>He that hath her is as if
he held a scorpion, &amp;c.</q> <span class="bibcite">xxvi. 25</span>, <q>a wicked wife makes a sorry

house with such a wife.</q> Her <a href="#note2370">[2370]</a>properties Jovianus Pontanus hath
described at large, <span class="cite">Ant. dial. Tom. 2</span>, under the name of Euphorbia. Or if
they be not equal in years, the like mischief happens. Cecilius in

<a href="#note2373">[2373]</a>A young gentlewoman in Basil was married, saith Felix Plater,
<span class="cite">observat. l. 1</span>, to an ancient man against her will, whom she could not
affect; she was continually melancholy, and pined away for grief; and
though her husband did all he could possibly to give her content, in a
discontented humour at length she hanged herself. Many other stories he
relates in this kind. Thus men are plagued with women; they again with men,
when they are of divers humours and conditions; he a spendthrift, she
sparing; one honest, the other dishonest, &amp;c. Parents many times disquiet
their children, and they their parents. <a href="#note2374">[2374]</a><q>A foolish son is an
heaviness to his mother.</q> <span lang="la">Injusta noverca</span>: a stepmother often vexeth a
whole family, is matter of repentance, exercise of patience, fuel of
dissension, which made Cato's son expostulate with his father, why he
should offer to marry his client Solinius' daughter, a young wench, <span lang="la">Cujus
causa novercam induceret</span>; what offence had he done, that he should marry
again?

<p>Unkind, unnatural friends, evil neighbours, bad servants, debts and
debates, &amp;c., 'twas Chilon's sentence, <span lang="la">comes aeris alieni et litis est
miseria</span>, misery and usury do commonly together; suretyship is the bane of
many families, <span lang="la">Sponde, praesto noxa est</span>: <q>he shall be sore vexed that is
surety for a stranger,</q> <span class="bibcite">Prov. xi. 15</span>, <q>and he that hateth suretyship is
sure.</q> Contention, brawling, lawsuits, falling out of neighbours and
friends.&mdash;<span lang="la">discordia demens</span> (Virg. <span class="cite">Aen. 6</span>,) are equal to the first,
grieve many a man, and vex his soul. <span lang="la">Nihil sane miserabilius eorum
mentibus</span>, (as <a href="#note2375">[2375]</a>Boter holds) <q>nothing so miserable as such men, full
of cares, griefs, anxieties, as if they were stabbed with a sharp sword,
fear, suspicion, desperation, sorrow, are their ordinary companions.</q> Our
Welshmen are noted by some of their <a href="#note2376">[2376]</a>own writers, to consume one
another in this kind; but whosoever they are that use it, these are their
common symptoms, especially if they be convict or overcome, <a href="#note2377">[2377]</a>cast in
a suit. Arius put out of a bishopric by Eustathius, turned heretic, and
lived after discontented all his life. <a href="#note2378">[2378]</a>Every repulse is of like
nature; <span lang="la">heu quanta de spe decidi</span>! Disgrace, infamy, detraction, will
almost effect as much, and that a long time after. Hipponax, a satirical
poet, so vilified and lashed two painters in his iambics, <span lang="la">ut ambo laqueo
se suffocarent</span>, <a href="#note2379">[2379]</a>Pliny saith, both hanged themselves. All
oppositions, dangers, perplexities, discontents, <a href="#note2380">[2380]</a>to live in any
suspense, are of the same rank: <span lang="la">potes hoc sub casu ducere somnos</span>? Who can
be secure in such cases? Ill-bestowed benefits, ingratitude, unthankful
friends, much disquiet and molest some. Unkind speeches trouble as many;
uncivil carriage or dogged answers, weak women above the rest, if they
proceed from their surly husbands, are as bitter as gall, and not to be
digested. A glassman's wife in Basil became melancholy because her husband
said he would marry again if she died. <q>No cut to unkindness,</q> as the
saying is, a frown and hard speech, ill respect, a browbeating, or bad
look, especially to courtiers, or such as attend upon great persons, is
present death: <span lang="la">Ingenium vultu statque caditque suo</span>, they ebb and flow
with their masters' favours. Some persons are at their wits' ends, if by
chance they overshoot themselves, in their ordinary speeches, or actions,
which may after turn to their disadvantage or disgrace, or have any secret
disclosed. Ronseus <span class="cite">epist. miscel. 2</span>, reports of a gentlewoman 25 years
old, that falling foul with one of her gossips, was upbraided with a secret
infirmity (no matter what) in public, and so much grieved with it, that she
did thereupon <span lang="la">solitudines quaerere omnes ab se ablegare, ac tandem in
gravissimam incidens melancholiam, contabescere</span>, forsake all company,
quite moped, and in a melancholy humour pine away. Others are as much
tortured to see themselves rejected, contemned, scorned, disabled, defamed,
detracted, undervalued, or <a href="#note2381">[2381]</a><q>left behind their fellows.</q> Lucian
brings in Aetamacles, a philosopher in his <span class="cite">Lapith. convivio</span>, much
discontented that he was not invited amongst the rest, expostulating the
matter, in a long epistle, with Aristenetus their host. Praetextatus, a
robed gentleman in Plutarch, would not sit down at a feast, because he
might not sit highest, but went his ways all in a chafe. We see the common
quarrelings, that are ordinary with us, for taking of the wall, precedency,
and the like, which though toys in themselves, and things of no moment, yet
they cause many distempers, much heart-burning amongst us. Nothing pierceth
deeper than a contempt or disgrace, <a href="#note2382">[2382]</a>especially if they be generous
spirits, scarce anything affects them more than to be despised or vilified.
Crato, <span class="cite">consil. 16, l. 2</span>, exemplifies it, and common experience confirms
it. Of the same nature is oppression, <span class="bibcite">Ecclus. 77</span>, <q>surely oppression makes
a man mad,</q> loss of liberty, which made Brutus venture his life, Cato kill
himself, and <a href="#note2383">[2383]</a>Tully complain, <span lang="la">Omnem hilaritatem in perpetuum amisi</span>,
mine heart's broken, I shall never look up, or be merry again, <a href="#note2384">[2384]</a><span lang="la">haec
jactura intolerabilis</span>, to some parties 'tis a most intolerable loss.

Polynices in his conference with Jocasta in <a href="#note2385">[2385]</a>Euripides, reckons up
five miseries of a banished man, the least of which alone were enough to
deject some pusillanimous creatures. Oftentimes a too great feeling of our
own infirmities or imperfections of body or mind, will shrivel us up; as if
we be long sick:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">O beata sanitas, te praesente, amaenum</div>
<div class="line">Ver florit gratiis, absque te nemo beatus:</div>
</div>
O blessed health! <q>thou art above all gold and treasure,</q> <span class="bibcite">Ecclus. xxx. 15</span>,
the poor man's riches, the rich man's bliss, without thee there can be no
happiness: or visited with some loathsome disease, offensive to others, or
troublesome to ourselves; as a stinking breath, deformity of our limbs,
crookedness, loss of an eye, leg, hand, paleness, leanness, redness,
baldness, loss or want of hair, &amp;c., <span lang="la">hic ubi fluere caepit, diros ictus
cordi infert</span>, saith <a href="#note2386">[2386]</a>Synesius, he himself troubled not a little <span lang="la">ob
comae defectum</span>, the loss of hair alone, strikes a cruel stroke to the
heart. Acco, an old woman, seeing by chance her face in a true glass (for
she used false flattering glasses belike at other times, as most
gentlewomen do,) <span lang="la">animi dolore in insaniam delapsa est</span>, (Caelius Rhodiginus
<span class="cite">l. 17, c. 2</span>,) ran mad. <a href="#note2387">[2387]</a>Brotheus, the son of Vulcan, because he

Corinth, now grown old, gave up her glass to Venus, for she could hot abide
to look upon it. <a href="#note2388">[2388]</a><span lang="la">Qualis sum nolo, qualis eram nequeo</span>. Generally to

To be foul, ugly, and deformed, much better be buried alive. Some are fair

Rachel said <q>in the anguish of her soul, give me a child, or I shall die:</q>
another hath too many: one was never married, and that's his hell, another

others by being traduced, slandered, abused, disgraced, vilified, or any
way injured: <span lang="la">minime miror eos</span> (as he said) <span lang="la">qui insanire occipiunt ex

particular causes of anger and offence Aristotle reckons them up, which for
brevity's sake I must omit. No tidings troubles one; ill reports, rumours,
bad tidings or news, hard hap, ill success, cast in a suit, vain hopes, or
hope deferred, another: expectation, <span lang="la">adeo omnibus in rebus molesta semper
est expectatio</span>, as <a href="#note2390">[2390]</a>Polybius observes; one is too eminent, another
too base born, and that alone tortures him as much as the rest: one is out
of action, company, employment; another overcome and tormented with worldly
cares, and onerous business. But what <a href="#note2391">[2391]</a>tongue can suffice to speak of
all?

<p>Many men catch this malady by eating certain meats, herbs, roots, at
unawares; as henbane, nightshade, cicuta, mandrakes, &amp;c. <a href="#note2392">[2392]</a>A company
of young men at Agrigentum in Sicily, came into a tavern; where after they
had freely taken their liquor, whether it were the wine itself, or
something mixed with it 'tis not yet known, <a href="#note2393">[2393]</a>but upon a sudden they
began to be so troubled in their brains, and their phantasy so crazed, that
they thought they were in a ship at sea, and now ready to be cast away by
reason of a tempest. Wherefore to avoid shipwreck and present drowning,
they flung all the goods in the house out at the windows into the street,
or into the sea, as they supposed; thus they continued mad a pretty season,
and being brought before the magistrate to give an account of this their
fact, they told him (not yet recovered of their madness) that what was done
they did for fear of death, and to avoid imminent danger: the spectators
were all amazed at this their stupidity, and gazed on them still, whilst
one of the ancientest of the company, in a grave tone, excused himself to
the magistrate upon his knees, <span lang="la">O viri Tritones, ego in imo jacui</span>, I
beseech your deities, &amp;c. for I was in the bottom of the ship all the
while: another besought them as so many sea gods to be good unto them, and
if ever he and his fellows came to land again, <a href="#note2394">[2394]</a>he would build an
altar to their service. The magistrate could not sufficiently laugh at this
their madness, bid them sleep it out, and so went his ways. Many such
accidents frequently happen, upon these unknown occasions. Some are so
caused by philters, wandering in the sun, biting of a mad dog, a blow on
the head, stinging with that kind of spider called tarantula, an ordinary
thing if we may believe Skeuck. <span class="cite">l. 6. de Venenis</span>, in Calabria and
Apulia in Italy, Cardan, <span class="cite">subtil. l. 9.</span> Scaliger <span class="cite">exercitat. 185.</span> Their
symptoms are merrily described by Jovianus Pontanus, <span class="cite">Ant. dial.</span> how they
dance altogether, and are cured by music. <a href="#note2395">[2395]</a>Cardan speaks of certain
stones, if they be carried about one, which will cause melancholy and
madness; he calls them unhappy, as an <a href="#note2396">[2396]</a><span lang="la">adamant, selenites</span>, &amp;c.
<q>which dry up the body, increase cares, diminish sleep:</q> Ctesias in
Persicis, makes mention of a well in those parts, of which if any man
drink, <a href="#note2397">[2397]</a><q>he is mad for 24 hours.</q> Some lose their wits by terrible
objects (as elsewhere I have more <a href="#note2398">[2398]</a>copiously dilated) and life itself
many times, as Hippolitus affrighted by Neptune's seahorses, Athemas by
Juno's furies: but these relations are common in all writers.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.5.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Continent, inward, antecedent, next causes and how the body works on the mind</i>.</h4>

<p>As a purlieu hunter, I have hitherto beaten about the circuit of the forest
of this microcosm, and followed only those outward adventitious causes. I
will now break into the inner rooms, and rip up the antecedent immediate
causes which are there to be found. For as the distraction of the mind,
amongst other outward causes and perturbations, alters the temperature of
the body, so the distraction and distemper of the body will cause a
distemperature of the soul, and 'tis hard to decide which of these two do
more harm to the other. Plato, Cyprian, and some others, as I have formerly
said, lay the greatest fault upon the soul, excusing the body; others again
accusing the body, excuse the soul, as a principal agent. Their reasons
are, because <a href="#note2401">[2401]</a><q>the manners do follow the temperature of the body,</q> as
Galen proves in his book of that subject, Prosper Calenius <span class="cite">de Atra bile</span>,
Jason Pratensis <span class="cite">c. de Mania</span>, Lemnius <span class="cite">l. 4. c. 16.</span> and many others. And
that which Gualter hath commented, <span class="cite">hom. 10. in epist. Johannis</span>, is most
true, concupiscence and originals in, inclinations, and bad humours, are
<a href="#note2402">[2402]</a>radical in every one of us, causing these perturbations, affections,
and several distempers, offering many times violence unto the soul. <q>Every
man is tempted by his own concupiscence (James i. 14), the spirit is
willing but the flesh is weak, and rebelleth against the spirit,</q> as our
<a href="#note2403">[2403]</a>apostle teacheth us: that methinks the soul hath the better plea
against the body, which so forcibly inclines us, that we cannot resist,
<span lang="la">Nec nos obniti contra, nec tendere tantum sufficimus</span>. How the body being
material, worketh upon the immaterial soul, by mediation of humours and
spirits, which participate of both, and ill-disposed organs, Cornelius
Agrippa hath discoursed <span class="cite">lib. 1. de occult. Philos. cap. 63, 64, 65.</span>
Levinus Lemnius <span class="cite">lib. 1. de occult. nat. mir. cap. 12. et 16. et 21.
institut. ad opt. vit</span>. Perkins <span class="cite">lib. 1. Cases of Cons. cap. 12.</span> T.
Bright <span class="cite">c. 10, 11, 12.</span> <q>in his treatise of melancholy,</q> for as, <a href="#note2404">[2404]</a>
anger, fear, sorrow, obtrectation, emulation, &amp;c. <span lang="la">si mentis intimos
recessus occuparint</span>, saith <a href="#note2405">[2405]</a>Lemnius, <span lang="la">corpori quoque infesta sunt,
et illi teterrimos morbos inferunt</span>, cause grievous diseases in the body,
so bodily diseases affect the soul by consent. Now the chiefest causes
proceed from the <a href="#note2406">[2406]</a>heart, humours, spirits: as they are purer, or
impurer, so is the mind, and equally suffers, as a lute out of tune, if one
string or one organ be distempered, all the rest miscarry, <a href="#note2407">[2407]</a><span lang="la">corpus
onustum hesternis vitiis, animum quoque praegravat una</span>. The body is
<span lang="la">domicilium animae</span>, her house, abode, and stay; and as a torch gives a
better light, a sweeter smell, according to the matter it is made of; so
doth our soul perform all her actions, better or worse, as her organs are
disposed; or as wine savours of the cask wherein it is kept; the soul
receives a tincture from the body, through which it works. We see this in
old men, children, Europeans; Asians, hot and cold climes; sanguine are
merry, melancholy sad, phlegmatic dull, by reason of abundance of those
humours, and they cannot resist such passions which are inflicted by them.
For in this infirmity of human nature, as Melancthon declares, the
understanding is so tied to, and captivated by his inferior senses, that
without their help he cannot exercise his functions, and the will being
weakened, hath but a small power to restrain those outward parts, but
suffers herself to be overruled by them; that I must needs conclude with
Lemnius, <span lang="la">spiritus et humores maximum nocumentum obtinent</span>, spirits and
humours do most harm in <a href="#note2408">[2408]</a>troubling the soul. How should a man choose
but be choleric and angry, that hath his body so clogged with abundance of
gross humours? or melancholy, that is so inwardly disposed? That thence
comes then this malady, madness, apoplexies, lethargies, &amp;c. it may not be
denied.

<p>Now this body of ours is most part distempered by some precedent diseases,
which molest his inward organs and instruments, and so <span lang="la">per consequens</span>
cause melancholy, according to the consent of the most approved physicians.
<a href="#note2409">[2409]</a><q>This humour</q> (as Avicenna <span class="cite">l. 3. Fen. 1. Tract. 4. c. 18.</span>
Arnoldus <span class="cite">breviar. l. 1. c. 18.</span> Jacchinus <span class="cite">comment. in 9 Rhasis, c.
15.</span> Montaltus, <span class="cite">c. 10.</span> Nicholas Piso <span class="cite">c. de Melan.</span> &amp;c. suppose) <q>is
begotten by the distemperature of some inward part, innate, or left after
some inflammation, or else included in the blood after an <a href="#note2410">[2410]</a>ague, or
some other malignant disease.</q> This opinion of theirs concurs with that of
Galen, <span class="cite">l. 3. c. 6. de locis affect</span>. Guianerius gives an instance in
one so caused by a quartan ague, and Montanus <span class="cite">consil. 32.</span> in a young man
of twenty-eight years of age, so distempered after a quartan, which had
molested him five years together; Hildesheim <span class="cite">spicel. 2. de Mania</span>,
relates of a Dutch baron, grievously tormented with melancholy after a long
<a href="#note2411">[2411]</a>ague: Galen, <span class="cite">l. de atra bile, c. 4.</span> puts the plague a cause.
Botaldus in his book <span class="cite">de lue vener. c. 2.</span> the French pox for a cause,
others, frenzy, epilepsy, apoplexy, because those diseases do often
degenerate into this. Of suppression of haemorrhoids, haemorrhagia, or bleeding
at the nose, menstruous retentions, (although they deserve a larger
explication, as being the sole cause of a proper kind of melancholy, in
more ancient maids, nuns and widows, handled apart by Rodericus a Castro,
and Mercatus, as I have elsewhere signified,) or any other evacuation
stopped, I have already spoken. Only this I will add, that this melancholy
which shall be caused by such infirmities, deserves to be pitied of all
men, and to be respected with a more tender compassion, according to
Laurentius, as coming from a more inevitable cause.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.5.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Distemperature of particular Parts, causes</i>.</h4>

<p>There is almost no part of the body, which being distempered, doth not
cause this malady, as the brain and his parts, heart, liver, spleen,
stomach, matrix or womb, pylorus, mirach, mesentery, hypochondries,
mesaraic veins; and in a word, saith <a href="#note2412">[2412]</a>Arculanus, <q>there is no part
which causeth not melancholy, either because it is adust, or doth not expel
the superfluity of the nutriment.</q> Savanarola <span class="cite">Pract. major. rubric. 11.
Tract. 6. cap. 1.</span> is of the same opinion, that melancholy is engendered
in each particular part, and <a href="#note2413">[2413]</a>Crato <span class="cite">in consil. 17. lib. 2.</span>
Gordonius, who is <span class="cite">instar omnium, lib. med. partic. 2. cap. 19.</span> confirms
as much, putting the <a href="#note2414">[2414]</a><q>matter of melancholy, sometimes in the
stomach, liver, heart, brain, spleen, mirach, hypochondries, when as the
melancholy humour resides there, or the liver is not well cleansed from
melancholy blood.</q>

<p>The brain is a familiar and frequent cause, too hot, or too cold, <a href="#note2415">[2415]</a>
<q>through adust blood so caused,</q> as Mercurialis will have it, <q>within or
without the head,</q> the brain itself being distempered. Those are most apt
to this disease, <a href="#note2416">[2416]</a><q>that have a hot heart and moist brain,</q> which
Montaltus <span class="cite">cap. 11. de Melanch.</span> approves out of Halyabbas, Rhasis, and
Avicenna. Mercurialis <span class="cite">consil. 11.</span> assigns the coldness of the brain a
cause, and Salustius Salvianus <span class="cite">med. lect. l. 2. c. 1.</span> <a href="#note2417">[2417]</a>will have
it <q>arise from a cold and dry distemperature of the brain.</q> Piso,
Benedictus Victorius Faventinus, will have it proceed from a <a href="#note2418">[2418]</a><q>hot
distemperature of the brain;</q> and <a href="#note2419">[2419]</a>Montaltus <span class="cite">cap. 10.</span> from the
brain's heat, scorching the blood. The brain is still distempered by
himself, or by consent: by himself or his proper affection, as Faventinus
calls it, <a href="#note2420">[2420]</a><q>or by vapours which arise from the other parts, and fume
up into the head, altering the animal facilities.</q>

<p>Hildesheim <span class="cite">spicel. 2. de Mania</span>, thinks it may be caused from a <a href="#note2421">[2421]</a>
<q>distemperature of the heart; sometimes hot; sometimes cold.</q> A hot liver,
and a cold stomach, are put for usual causes of melancholy: Mercurialis
<span class="cite">consil. 11. et consil. 6. consil. 86.</span> assigns a hot liver and cold
stomach for ordinary causes. <a href="#note2422">[2422]</a>Monavius, in an epistle of his to Crato
in Scoltzius, is of opinion, that hypochondriacal melancholy may proceed
from a cold liver; the question is there discussed. Most agree that a hot
liver is in fault; <a href="#note2423">[2423]</a><q>the liver is the shop of humours, and especially
causeth melancholy by his hot and dry distemperature.</q> <a href="#note2424">[2424]</a><q>The stomach
and mesaraic veins do often concur, by reason of their obstructions, and
thence their heat cannot be avoided, and many times the matter is so adust
and inflamed in those parts, that it degenerates into hypochondriacal
melancholy.</q> Guianerius <span class="cite">c. 2. Tract. 15.</span> holds the mesaraic veins to be a
sufficient <a href="#note2425">[2425]</a>cause alone. The spleen concurs to this malady, by all
their consents, and suppression of haemorrhoids, <span lang="la">dum non expurget alter a
causa lien</span>, saith Montaltus, if it be <a href="#note2426">[2426]</a><q>too cold and dry, and do not
purge the other parts as it ought,</q> <span class="cite">consil. 23.</span> Montanus puts the <a href="#note2427">[2427]</a>
<q>spleen stopped</q> for a great cause. <a href="#note2428">[2428]</a>Christophorus a Vega reports of
his knowledge, that he hath known melancholy caused from putrefied blood in
those seed-veins and womb; <a href="#note2429">[2429]</a><q>Arculanus, from that menstruous blood
turned into melancholy, and seed too long detained (as I have already
declared) by putrefaction or adustion.</q>

<p>The mesenterium, or midriff, diaphragma, is a cause which the <a href="#note2430">[2430]</a>Greeks
called <span lang="gr">&phi;&rho;&#x1F73;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>: because by his inflammation, the mind is much
troubled with convulsions and dotage. All these, most part, offend by
inflammation, corrupting humours and spirits, in this non-natural
melancholy: for from these are engendered fuliginous and black spirits. And
for that reason <a href="#note2431">[2431]</a>Montaltus <span class="cite">cap. 10. de causis melan.</span> will have
<q>the efficient cause of melancholy to be hot and dry, not a cold and dry
distemperature, as some hold, from the heat of the brain, roasting the
blood, immoderate heat of the liver and bowels, and inflammation of the
pylorus. And so much the rather, because that,</q> as Galen holds, <q>all spices
inflame the blood, solitariness, waking, agues, study, meditation, all
which heat: and therefore he concludes that this distemperature causing
adventitious melancholy is not cold and dry, but hot and dry.</q> But of this
I have sufficiently treated in the matter of melancholy, and hold that this
may be true in non-natural melancholy, which produceth madness, but not in
that natural, which is more cold, and being immoderate, produceth a gentle
dotage. <a href="#note2432">[2432]</a>Which opinion Geraldus de Solo maintains in his comment upon
Rhasis.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.5.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Causes of Head-Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>After a tedious discourse of the general causes of melancholy, I am now
returned at last to treat in brief of the three particular species, and
such causes as properly appertain unto them. Although these causes
promiscuously concur to each and every particular kind, and commonly
produce their effects in that part which is most ill-disposed, and least
able to resist, and so cause all three species, yet many of them are proper
to some one kind, and seldom found in the rest. As for example,
head-melancholy is commonly caused by a cold or hot distemperature of the
brain, according to Laurentius <span class="cite">cap. 5 de melan</span>. but as <a href="#note2433">[2433]</a>Hercules de
Saxonia contends, from that agitation or distemperature of the animal
spirits alone. Salust. Salvianus, before mentioned, <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 3. de re
med.</span> will have it proceed from cold: but that I take of natural
melancholy, such as are fools and dote: for as Galen writes <span class="cite">lib. 4. de
puls. 8.</span> and Avicenna, <a href="#note2434">[2434]</a><q>a cold and moist brain is an inseparable
companion of folly.</q> But this adventitious melancholy which is here meant,
is caused of a hot and dry distemperature, as <a href="#note2435">[2435]</a>Damascen the Arabian
<span class="cite">lib. 3. cap. 22.</span> thinks, and most writers: Altomarus and Piso call it
<a href="#note2436">[2436]</a><q>an innate burning intemperateness, turning blood and choler into
melancholy.</q> Both these opinions may stand good, as Bruel maintains, and
Capivaccius, <span lang="la">si cerebrum sit calidius</span>, <a href="#note2437">[2437]</a><q>if the brain be hot, the
animal spirits will be hot, and thence comes madness; if cold, folly.</q>
David Crusius <span class="cite">Theat. morb. Hermet. lib. 2. cap. 6. de atra bile</span>,
grants melancholy to be a disease of an inflamed brain, but cold
notwithstanding of itself: <span lang="la">calida per accidens, frigida per se</span>, hot by
accident only; I am of Capivaccius' mind for my part. Now this humour,
according to Salvianus, is sometimes in the substance of the brain,
sometimes contained in the membranes and tunicles that cover the brain,
sometimes in the passages of the ventricles of the brain, or veins of those
ventricles. It follows many times <a href="#note2438">[2438]</a><q>frenzy, long diseases, agues,
long abode in hot places, or under the sun, a blow on the head,</q> as Rhasis
informeth us: Piso adds solitariness, waking, inflammations of the head,
proceeding most part <a href="#note2439">[2439]</a>from much use of spices, hot wines, hot meats:
all which Montanus reckons up <span class="cite">consil. 22.</span> for a melancholy Jew; and
Heurnius repeats <span class="cite">cap. 12. de Mania</span>: hot baths, garlic, onions, saith
Guianerius, bad air, corrupt, much <a href="#note2440">[2440]</a>waking, &amp;c., retention of seed or
abundance, stopping of haemorrhagia, the midriff misaffected; and according
to Trallianus <span class="cite">l. 1. 16.</span> immoderate cares, troubles, griefs, discontent,
study, meditation, and, in a word, the abuse of all those six non-natural
things. Hercules de Saxonia, <span class="cite">cap. 16. lib. 1.</span> will have it caused from
a <a href="#note2441">[2441]</a>cautery, or boil dried up, or an issue. Amatus Lusitanus <span class="cite">cent.
2. cura. 67.</span> gives instance in a fellow that had a hole in his arm,
<a href="#note2442">[2442]</a><q>after that was healed, ran mad, and when the wound was open, he was
cured again.</q> Trincavellius <span class="cite">consil. 13. lib. 1.</span> hath an example of a
melancholy man so caused by overmuch continuance in the sun, frequent use
of venery, and immoderate exercise: and in his <span class="cite">cons. 49. lib. 3.</span> from a
<a href="#note2443">[2443]</a>headpiece overheated, which caused head-melancholy. Prosper Calenus
brings in Cardinal Caesius for a pattern of such as are so melancholy by
long study; but examples are infinite.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.5.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Causes of Hypochondriacal, or Windy Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>In repeating of these causes, I must <span lang="la">crambem bis coctam apponere</span>, say
that again which I have formerly said, in applying them to their proper
species. Hypochondriacal or flatuous melancholy, is that which the Arabians
call mirachial, and is in my judgment the most grievous and frequent,
though Bruel and Laurentius make it least dangerous, and not so hard to be
known or cured. His causes are inward or outward. Inward from divers parts
or organs, as midriff, spleen, stomach, liver, pylorus, womb, diaphragma,
mesaraic veins, stopping of issues, &amp;c. Montaltus <span class="cite">cap. 15.</span> out of Galen
recites, <a href="#note2444">[2444]</a><q>heat and obstruction of those mesaraic veins, as an
immediate cause, by which means the passage of the chilus to the liver is
detained, stopped or corrupted, and turned into rumbling and wind.</q>
Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 233</span>, hath an evident demonstration, Trincavelius
another, <span class="cite">lib. 1, cap. 1</span>, and Plater a third, <span class="cite">observat. lib. 1</span>, for a
doctor of the law visited with this infirmity, from the said obstruction
and heat of these mesaraic veins, and bowels; <span lang="la">quoniam inter ventriculum et
jecur venae effervescunt</span>, the veins are inflamed about the liver and
stomach. Sometimes those other parts are together misaffected; and concur
to the production of this malady: a hot liver and cold stomach, or cold
belly: look for instances in Hollerius, Victor Trincavelius, <span class="cite">consil. 35,
l. 3</span>, Hildesheim <span class="cite">Spicel. 2, fol. 132</span>, Solenander <span class="cite">consil. 9, pro
cive Lugdunensi</span>, Montanus <span class="cite">consil. 229</span>, for the Earl of Montfort in
Germany, 1549, and Frisimelica in the 233 consultation of the said
Montanus. I. Caesar Claudinus gives instance of a cold stomach and over-hot
liver, almost in every consultation, <span class="cite">con. 89</span>, for a certain count; and
<span class="cite">con. 106</span>, for a Polonian baron, by reason of heat the blood is inflamed,
and gross vapours sent to the heart and brain. Mercurialis subscribes to
them, <span class="cite">cons. 89</span>, <a href="#note2445">[2445]</a><q>the stomach being misaffected,</q> which he calls
the king of the belly, because if he be distempered, all the rest suffer
with him, as being deprived of their nutriment, or fed with bad
nourishment, by means of which come crudities, obstructions, wind,
rumbling, griping, &amp;c. Hercules de Saxonia, besides heat, will have the
weakness of the liver and his obstruction a cause, <span lang="la">facultatem debilem
jecinoris</span>, which he calls the mineral of melancholy. Laurentius assigns
this reason, because the liver over-hot draws the meat undigested out of
the stomach, and burneth the humours. Montanus, <span class="cite">cons. 244</span>, proves that
sometimes a cold liver may be a cause. Laurentius <span class="cite">c. 12</span>, Trincavelius
<span class="cite">lib. 12, consil.</span>, and Gualter Bruel, seems to lay the greatest fault
upon the spleen, that doth not his duty in purging the liver as he ought,
being too great, or too little, in drawing too much blood sometimes to it,
and not expelling it, as P. Cnemiandrus in a <a href="#note2446">[2446]</a>consultation of his
noted <span lang="la">tumorem lienis</span>, he names it, and the fountain of melancholy.
Diocles supposed the ground of this kind of melancholy to proceed from the
inflammation of the pylorus, which is the nether mouth of the ventricle.
Others assign the mesenterium or midriff distempered by heat, the womb
misaffected, stopping of haemorrhoids, with many such. All which Laurentius,
<span class="cite">cap. 12</span>, reduceth to three, mesentery, liver, and spleen, from whence he
denominates hepatic, splenetic, and mesaraic melancholy. Outward causes,
are bad diet, care, griefs, discontents, and in a word all those six
non-natural things, as Montanus found by his experience, <span class="cite">consil. 244.</span>
Solenander <span class="cite">consil. 9</span>, for a citizen of Lyons, in France, gives his reader
to understand, that he knew this mischief procured by a medicine of
cantharides, which an unskilful physician ministered his patient to drink
<span lang="la">ad venerem excitandam</span>. But most commonly fear, grief, and some sudden
commotion, or perturbation of the mind, begin it, in such bodies especially
as are ill-disposed. Melancthon, <span class="cite">tract. 14, cap. 2, de anima</span>, will
have it as common to men, as the mother to women, upon some grievous
trouble, dislike, passion, or discontent. For as Camerarius records in his
life, Melancthon himself was much troubled with it, and therefore could
speak out of experience. Montanus, <span class="cite">consil. 22, pro delirante Judaeo</span>,
confirms it, <a href="#note2447">[2447]</a>grievous symptoms of the mind brought him to it.
Randolotius relates of himself, that being one day very intent to write out
a physician's notes, molested by an occasion, he fell into a
hypochondriacal fit, to avoid which he drank the decoction of wormwood, and
was freed. <a href="#note2448">[2448]</a>Melancthon <q>(being the disease is so troublesome and
frequent) holds it a most necessary and profitable study, for every man to
know the accidents of it, and a dangerous thing to be ignorant,</q> and would
therefore have all men in some sort to understand the causes, symptoms, and
cures of it.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.2.5.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Causes of Melancholy from the whole Body</i>.</h4>

<p>As before, the cause of this kind of melancholy is inward or outward.
Inward, <a href="#note2449">[2449]</a><q>when the liver is apt to engender such a humour, or the
spleen weak by nature, and not able to discharge his office.</q> A melancholy
temperature, retention of haemorrhoids, monthly issues, bleeding at nose,
long diseases, agues, and all those six non-natural things increase it. But
especially <a href="#note2450">[2450]</a>bad diet, as Piso thinks, pulse, salt meat, shellfish,
cheese, black wine, &amp;c. Mercurialis out of Averroes and Avicenna condemns
all herbs: Galen, <span class="cite">lib. 3, de loc. affect. cap. 7</span>, especially cabbage.
So likewise fear, sorrow, discontents, &amp;c., but of these before. And thus
in brief you have had the general and particular causes of melancholy.

<p>Now go and brag of thy present happiness, whosoever thou art, brag of thy
temperature, of thy good parts, insult, triumph, and boast; thou seest in
what a brittle state thou art, how soon thou mayst be dejected, how many
several ways, by bad diet, bad air, a small loss, a little sorrow or
discontent, an ague, &amp;c.; how many sudden accidents may procure thy ruin,
what a small tenure of happiness thou hast in this life, how weak and silly
a creature thou art. <q>Humble thyself, therefore, under the mighty hand of
God,</q> <span class="bibcite">1 Peter, v. 6</span>, know thyself, acknowledge thy present misery, and make
right use of it. <span lang="la">Qui stat videat ne cadat.</span> Thou dost now flourish, and
hast <span lang="la">bona animi, corporis, et fortunae</span>, goods of body, mind, and fortune,
<span lang="la">nescis quid serus secum vesper ferat</span>, thou knowest not what storms and
tempests the late evening may bring with it. Be not secure then, <q>be sober
and watch,</q> <a href="#note2451">[2451]</a><span lang="la">fortunam reverenter habe</span>, if fortunate and rich; if
sick and poor, moderate thyself. I have said.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.3.1.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Symptoms, or Signs of Melancholy in the Body</i>.</h4>

<p>Parrhasius, a painter of Athens, amongst those Olynthian captives Philip of
Macedon brought home to sell, <a href="#note2452">[2452]</a>bought one very old man; and when he
had him at Athens, put him to extreme torture and torment, the better by
his example to express the pains and passions of his Prometheus, whom he
was then about to paint. I need not be so barbarous, inhuman, curious, or
cruel, for this purpose to torture any poor melancholy man, their symptoms
are plain, obvious and familiar, there needs no such accurate observation
or far-fetched object, they delineate themselves, they voluntarily betray
themselves, they are too frequent in all places, I meet them still as I go,
they cannot conceal it, their grievances are too well known, I need not
seek far to describe them.

<p>Symptoms therefore are either <a href="#note2453">[2453]</a>universal or particular, saith
Gordonius, <span class="cite">lib. med. cap. 19, part. 2</span>, to persons, to species; <q>some
signs are secret, some manifest, some in the body, some in the mind, and
diversely vary, according to the inward or outward causes,</q> Capivaccius:
or from stars, according to Jovianus Pontanus, <span class="cite">de reb. caelest. lib. 10,
cap. 13</span>, and celestial influences, or from the humours diversely mixed,
Ficinus, <span class="cite">lib. 1, cap. 4, de sanit. tuenda</span>: as they are hot, cold,
natural, unnatural, intended, or remitted, so will Aetius have <span lang="la">melancholica
deliria multiformia</span>, diversity of melancholy signs. Laurentius ascribes
them to their several temperatures, delights, natures, inclinations,
continuance of time, as they are simple or mixed with other diseases, as
the causes are divers, so must the signs be, almost infinite, Altomarus
<span class="cite">cap. 7, art. med.</span> And as wine produceth divers effects, or that herb
Tortocolla in <a href="#note2454">[2454]</a>Laurentius, <q>which makes some laugh, some weep, some
sleep, some dance, some sing, some howl, some drink, &amp;c.</q> so doth this our
melancholy humour work several signs in several parties.

<p>But to confine them, these general symptoms may be reduced to those of the
body or the mind. Those usual signs appearing in the bodies of such as are
melancholy, be these cold and dry, or they are hot and dry, as the humour
is more or less adust. From <a href="#note2455">[2455]</a>these first qualities arise many other
second, as that of <a href="#note2456">[2456]</a>colour, black, swarthy, pale, ruddy, &amp;c., some
are <span lang="la">impense rubri</span>, as Montaltus <span class="cite">cap. 16</span> observes out of Galen, <span class="cite">lib.
3, de locis affectis</span>, very red and high coloured. Hippocrates in his book
<a href="#note2457">[2457]</a><span class="cite">de insania et melan.</span> reckons up these signs, that they are <a href="#note2458">[2458]</a>
<q>lean, withered, hollow-eyed, look old, wrinkled, harsh, much troubled with
wind, and a griping in their bellies, or bellyache, belch often, dry
bellies and hard, dejected looks, flaggy beards, singing of the ears,
vertigo, light-headed, little or no sleep, and that interrupt, terrible and
fearful dreams,</q> <a href="#note2459">[2459]</a><span lang="la">Anna soror, quae, me suspensam insomnia terrent</span>?
The same symptoms are repeated by Melanelius in his book of melancholy
collected out of Galen, Ruffus, Aetius, by Rhasis, Gordonius, and all the
juniors, <a href="#note2460">[2460]</a><q>continual, sharp, and stinking belchings, as if their meat
in their stomachs were putrefied, or that they had eaten fish, dry bellies,
absurd and interrupt dreams, and many fantastical visions about their eyes,
vertiginous, apt to tremble, and prone to venery.</q> <a href="#note2461">[2461]</a>Some add
palpitation of the heart, cold sweat, as usual symptoms, and a leaping in
many parts of the body, <span lang="la">saltum in multis corporis partibus</span>, a kind of
itching, saith Laurentius, on the superficies of the skin, like a
flea-biting sometimes. <a href="#note2462">[2462]</a>Montaltus <span class="cite">cap. 21.</span> puts fixed eyes and much
twinkling of their eyes for a sign, and so doth Avicenna, <span lang="la">oculos habentes
palpitantes, trauli, vehementer rubicundi</span>, &amp;c., <span class="cite">lib. 3. Fen. 1. Tract.
4. cap. 18.</span> They stut most part, which he took out of Hippocrates'
aphorisms. <a href="#note2463">[2463]</a>Rhasis makes <q>headache and a binding heaviness for a
principal token, much leaping of wind about the skin, as well as stutting,
or tripping in speech, &amp;c., hollow eyes, gross veins, and broad lips.</q> To
some too, if they be far gone, mimical gestures are too familiar, laughing,
grinning, fleering, murmuring, talking to themselves, with strange mouths
and faces, inarticulate voices, exclamations, &amp;c. And although they be
commonly lean, hirsute, uncheerful in countenance, withered, and not so
pleasant to behold, by reason of those continual fears, griefs, and
vexations, dull, heavy, lazy, restless, unapt to go about any business; yet
their memories are most part good, they have happy wits, and excellent
apprehensions. Their hot and dry brains make them they cannot sleep,
<span lang="la">Ingentes habent et crebras vigilias</span> (Arteus) mighty and often watchings,
sometimes waking for a month, a year together. <a href="#note2464">[2464]</a>Hercules de Saxonia
faithfully averreth, that he hath heard his mother swear, she slept not for
seven months together: Trincavelius, <span class="cite">Tom. 2. cons. 16.</span> speaks of one
that waked 50 days, and Skenkius hath examples of two years, and all
without offence. In natural actions their appetite is greater than their
concoction, <span lang="la">multa appetunt pauca digerunt</span> as Rhasis hath it, they covet
to eat, but cannot digest. And although they <a href="#note2465">[2465]</a><q>do eat much, yet they
are lean, ill-liking,</q> saith Areteus, <q>withered and hard, much troubled
with costiveness,</q> crudities, oppilations, spitting, belching, &amp;c. Their
pulse is rare and slow, except it be of the <a href="#note2466">[2466]</a>Carotides, which is very
strong; but that varies according to their intended passions or
perturbations, as Struthius hath proved at large, <span class="cite">Spigmaticae. artis l. 4.
c. 13.</span> To say truth, in such chronic diseases the pulse is not much to be
respected, there being so much superstition in it, as <a href="#note2467">[2467]</a>Crato notes,
and so many differences in Galen, that he dares say they may not be
observed, or understood of any man.

<p>Their urine is most part pale, and low coloured, <span lang="la">urina pauca acris,
biliosa</span> (Areteus), not much in quantity; but this, in my judgment, is all
out as uncertain as the other, varying so often according to several
persons, habits, and other occasions not to be respected in chronic
diseases. <a href="#note2468">[2468]</a><q>Their melancholy excrements in some very much, in others
little, as the spleen plays his part,</q> and thence proceeds wind,
palpitation of the heart, short breath, plenty of humidity in the stomach,
heaviness of heart and heartache, and intolerable stupidity and dullness of
spirits. Their excrements or stool hard, black to some and little. If the
heart, brain, liver, spleen, be misaffected, as usually they are, many
inconveniences proceed from them, many diseases accompany, as incubus,
<a href="#note2469">[2469]</a>apoplexy, epilepsy, vertigo, those frequent wakings and terrible
dreams, <a href="#note2470">[2470]</a>intempestive laughing, weeping, sighing, sobbing,
bashfulness, blushing, trembling, sweating, swooning, &amp;c. <a href="#note2471">[2471]</a>All their
senses are troubled, they think they see, hear, smell, and touch that which
they do not, as shall be proved in the following discourse.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.3.1.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Symptoms or Signs in the Mind</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Fear</i>.] Arculanus <span class="cite">in 9. Rhasis ad Almansor. cap. 16.</span> will have these
symptoms to be infinite, as indeed they are, varying according to the
parties, <q>for scarce is there one of a thousand that dotes alike,</q> <a href="#note2472">[2472]</a>
Laurentius <span class="cite">c. 16.</span> Some few of greater note I will point at; and amongst
the rest, fear and sorrow, which as they are frequent causes, so if they
persevere long, according to Hippocrates <a href="#note2473">[2473]</a>and Galen's aphorisms, they
are most assured signs, inseparable companions, and characters of
melancholy; of present melancholy and habituated, saith Montaltus <span class="cite">cap.
11.</span> and common to them all, as the said Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and
all Neoterics hold. But as hounds many times run away with a false cry,
never perceiving themselves to be at a fault, so do they. For Diocles of
old, (whom Galen confutes,) and amongst the juniors, <a href="#note2474">[2474]</a>Hercules de
Saxonia, with Lod. Mercatus <span class="cite">cap. 17. l. 1. de melan.</span>, takes just
exceptions, at this aphorism of Hippocrates, 'tis not always true, or so
generally to be understood, <q>fear and sorrow are no common symptoms to all
melancholy; upon more serious consideration, I find some</q> (saith he) <q>that
are not so at all. Some indeed are sad, and not fearful; some fearful and
not sad; some neither fearful nor sad; some both.</q> Four kinds he excepts,
fanatical persons, such as were Cassandra, Nanto, Nicostrata, Mopsus,
Proteus, the sibyls, whom <a href="#note2475">[2475]</a>Aristotle confesseth to have been deeply
melancholy. Baptista Porta seconds him, <span class="cite">Physiog. lib. 1, cap. 8</span>, they
were <span lang="la">atra bile perciti</span>: demoniacal persons, and such as speak strange
languages, are of this rank: some poets, such as laugh always, and think
themselves kings, cardinals, &amp;c., sanguine they are, pleasantly disposed
most part, and so continue. <a href="#note2476">[2476]</a>Baptista Portia confines fear and sorrow
to them that are cold; but lovers, Sibyls, enthusiasts, he wholly excludes.
So that I think I may truly conclude, they are not always sad and fearful,
but usually so: and that <a href="#note2477">[2477]</a>without a cause, <span lang="la">timent de non timendis</span>,
(Gordonius,) <span lang="la">quaeque momenti non sunt</span>, <q>although not all alike</q> (saith
Altomarus), <a href="#note2478">[2478]</a><q>yet all likely fear,</q> <a href="#note2479">[2479]</a><q>some with an extraordinary
and a mighty fear,</q> Areteus. <a href="#note2480">[2480]</a><q>Many fear death, and yet in a contrary
humour, make away themselves,</q> Galen, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de loc. affec. cap. 7.</span>
Some are afraid that heaven will fall on their heads: some they are damned,
or shall be. <a href="#note2481">[2481]</a><q>They are troubled with scruples of consciences,
distrusting God's mercies, think they shall go certainly to hell, the devil
will have them, and make great lamentation,</q> Jason Pratensis. Fear of
devils, death, that they shall be so sick, of some such or such disease,
ready to tremble at every object, they shall die themselves forthwith, or
that some of their dear friends or near allies are certainly dead; imminent
danger, loss, disgrace still torment others, &amp;c.; that they are all glass,
and therefore will suffer no man to come near them: that they are all cork,
as light as feathers; others as heavy as lead; some are afraid their heads
will fall off their shoulders, that they have frogs in their bellies, &amp;c.
<a href="#note2482">[2482]</a>Montanus <span class="cite">consil. 23</span>, speaks of one <q>that durst not walk alone from
home, for fear he should swoon or die.</q> A second <a href="#note2483">[2483]</a><q>fears every man he
meets will rob him, quarrel with him, or kill him.</q> A third dares not
venture to walk alone, for fear he should meet the devil, a thief, be sick;
fears all old women as witches, and every black dog or cat he sees he
suspecteth to be a devil, every person comes near him is maleficiated,
every creature, all intend to hurt him, seek his ruin; another dares not go
over a bridge, come near a pool, rock, steep hill, lie in a chamber where
cross beams are, for fear he be tempted to hang, drown, or precipitate
himself. If he be in a silent auditory, as at a sermon, he is afraid he
shall speak aloud at unawares, something indecent, unfit to be said. If he
be locked in a close room, he is afraid of being stifled for want of air,
and still carries biscuit, aquavitae, or some strong waters about him, for
fear of deliquiums, or being sick; or if he be in a throng, middle of a
church, multitude, where he may not well get out, though he sit at ease, he
is so misaffected. He will freely promise, undertake any business
beforehand, but when it comes to be performed, he dare not adventure, but
fears an infinite number of dangers, disasters, &amp;c. Some are <a href="#note2484">[2484]</a>
<q>afraid to be burned, or that the <a href="#note2485">[2485]</a>ground will sink under them, or
<a href="#note2486">[2486]</a>swallow them quick, or that the king will call them in question for
some fact they never did (Rhasis <span class="cite">cont.</span>) and that they shall surely be
executed.</q> The terror of such a death troubles them, and they fear as much
and are equally tormented in mind, <a href="#note2487">[2487]</a><q>as they that have committed a
murder, and are pensive without a cause, as if they were now presently to
be put to death.</q> Plater, <span class="cite">cap. 3. de mentis alienat.</span> They are afraid of
some loss, danger, that they shall surely lose their lives, goods, and all
they have, but why they know not. Trincavelius, <span class="cite">consil. 13. lib. 1.</span> had
a patient that would needs make away himself, for fear of being hanged, and
could not be persuaded for three years together, but that he had killed a
man. Plater, <span class="cite">observat. lib. 1.</span> hath two other examples of such as feared
to be executed without a cause. If they come in a place where a robbery,
theft, or any such offence hath been done, they presently fear they are
suspected, and many times betray themselves without a cause. Lewis XI., the
French king, suspected every man a traitor that came about him, durst trust
no officer. <span lang="la">Alii formidolosi omnium, alii quorundam</span> (Fracatorius <span class="cite">lib. 2.
de Intellect.</span>) <a href="#note2488">[2488]</a><q>some fear all alike, some certain men, and cannot
endure their companies, are sick in them, or if they be from home.</q> Some
suspect <a href="#note2489">[2489]</a>treason still, others <q>are afraid of their <a href="#note2490">[2490]</a>dearest
and nearest friends.</q> (<span lang="la">Melanelius e Galeno, Ruffo, Aetio</span>,) and dare not be
alone in the dark for fear of hobgoblins and devils: he suspects everything
he hears or sees to be a devil, or enchanted, and imagineth a thousand
chimeras and visions, which to his thinking he certainly sees, bugbears,
talks with black men, ghosts, goblins, &amp;c., <a href="#note2491">[2491]</a><span lang="la">Omnes se terrent aurae,
sonus excitat omnis.</span> Another through bashfulness, suspicion, and
timorousness will not be seen abroad, <a href="#note2492">[2492]</a><q>loves darkness as life, and
cannot endure the light,</q> or to sit in lightsome places, his hat still in
his eyes, he will neither see nor be seen by his goodwill, Hippocrates,
<span class="cite">lib. de Insania et Melancholia</span>. He dare not come in company for fear he
should be misused, disgraced, overshoot himself in gesture or speeches, or
be sick; he thinks every man observes him, aims at him, derides him, owes
him malice. Most part <a href="#note2493">[2493]</a><q>they are afraid they are bewitched,
possessed, or poisoned by their enemies, and sometimes they suspect their
nearest friends: he thinks something speaks or talks within him, and he
belcheth of the poison.</q> Christophorus a Vega, <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 1.</span> had a
patient so troubled, that by no persuasion or physic he could be reclaimed.
Some are afraid that they shall have every fearful disease they see others
have, hear of, or read, and dare not therefore hear or read of any such
subject, no not of melancholy itself, lest by applying to themselves that
which they hear or read, they should aggravate and increase it. If they see
one possessed, bewitched, an epileptic paroxysm, a man shaking with the
palsy, or giddy-headed, reeling or standing in a dangerous place, &amp;c., for
many days after it runs in their minds, they are afraid they shall be so
too, they are in like danger, as Perkins <span class="cite">c. 12. sc. 12.</span> well observes in
his Cases of Conscience and many times by violence of imagination they produce
it. They cannot endure to see any terrible object, as a monster, a man
executed, a carcase, hear the devil named, or any tragical relation seen,
but they quake for fear, <span lang="la">Hecatas somniare sibi videntur</span> (Lucian) they
dream of hobgoblins, and may not get it out of their minds a long time
after: they apply (as I have said) all they hear, see, read, to themselves;
as <a href="#note2494">[2494]</a>Felix Plater notes of some young physicians, that study to cure
diseases, catch them themselves, will be sick, and appropriate all symptoms
they find related of others, to their own persons. And therefore (<span lang="la">quod
iterum moneo, licet nauseam paret lectori, malo decem potius verba, decies
repetita licet abundare, quam unum desiderari</span>) I would advise him that is
actually melancholy not to read this tract of Symptoms, lest he disquiet or
make himself for a time worse, and more melancholy than he was before.
Generally of them all take this, <span lang="la">de inanibus semper conqueruntur et
timent</span>, saith Aretius; they complain of toys, and fear <a href="#note2495">[2495]</a>without a
cause, and still think their melancholy to be most grievous, none so bad as
they are, though it be nothing in respect, yet never any man sure was so
troubled, or in this sort. As really tormented and perplexed, in as great
an agony for toys and trifles (such things as they will after laugh at
themselves) as if they were most material and essential matters indeed,
worthy to be feared, and will not be satisfied. Pacify them for one, they
are instantly troubled with some other fear; always afraid of something
which they foolishly imagine or conceive to themselves, which never
peradventure was, never can be, never likely will be; troubled in mind upon
every small occasion, unquiet, still complaining, grieving, vexing,
suspecting, grudging, discontent, and cannot be freed so long as melancholy
continues. Or if their minds be more quiet for the present, and they free
from foreign fears, outward accidents, yet their bodies are out of tune,
they suspect some part or other to be amiss, now their head aches, heart,
stomach, spleen, &amp;c. is misaffected, they shall surely have this or that
disease; still troubled in body, mind, or both, and through wind, corrupt
fantasy, some accidental distemper, continually molested. Yet for all this,
as <a href="#note2496">[2496]</a>Jacchinus notes, <q>in all other things they are wise, staid,
discreet, and do nothing unbeseeming their dignity, person, or place, this
foolish, ridiculous, and childish fear excepted;</q> which so much, so
continually tortures and crucifies their souls, like a barking dog that
always bawls, but seldom bites, this fear ever molesteth, and so long as
melancholy lasteth, cannot be avoided.

<p>Sorrow is that other character, and inseparable companion, as individual as
Saint Cosmus and Damian, <span lang="la">fidus Achates</span>, as all writers witness, a common
symptom, a continual, and still without any evident cause, <a href="#note2497">[2497]</a><span lang="la">moerent
omnes, et si roges eos reddere causam, non possunt</span>: grieving still, but
why they cannot tell: <span lang="la">Agelasti, moesti, cogitabundi</span>, they look as if they
had newly come forth of Trophonius' den. And though they laugh many times,
and seem to be extraordinary merry (as they will by fits), yet extreme
lumpish again in an instant, dull and heavy, <span lang="la">semel et simul</span>, merry and
sad, but most part sad: <a href="#note2498">[2498]</a><span lang="la">Si qua placent, abeunt; inimica tenacius
haerent</span>: sorrow sticks by them still continually, gnawing as the vulture
did <a href="#note2499">[2499]</a>Titius' bowels, and they cannot avoid it. No sooner are their
eyes open, but after terrible and troublesome dreams their heavy hearts
begin to sigh: they are still fretting, chafing, sighing, grieving,
complaining, finding faults, repining, grudging, weeping,
<span lang="la">Heautontimorumenoi</span>, vexing themselves, <a href="#note2500">[2500]</a>disquieted in mind, with
restless, unquiet thoughts, discontent, either for their own, other men's
or public affairs, such as concern them not; things past, present, or to
come, the remembrance of some disgrace, loss, injury, abuses, &amp;c. troubles
them now being idle afresh, as if it were new done; they are afflicted
otherwise for some danger, loss, want, shame, misery, that will certainly
come, as they suspect and mistrust. Lugubris Ate frowns upon them, insomuch
that Areteus well calls it <span lang="la">angorem animi</span>, a vexation of the mind, a
perpetual agony. They can hardly be pleased, or eased, though in other
men's opinion most happy, go, tarry, run, ride, <a href="#note2501">[2501]</a>&mdash;<span lang="la">post equitem sedet
atra cura</span>: they cannot avoid this feral plague, let them come in what
company they will, <a href="#note2502">[2502]</a><span lang="la">haeret leteri lethalis arundo</span>, as to a deer that
is struck, whether he run, go, rest with the herd, or alone, this grief
remains: irresolution, inconstancy, vanity of mind, their fear, torture,
care, jealousy, suspicion, &amp;c., continues, and they cannot be relieved. So
<a href="#note2503">[2503]</a>he complained in the poet,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Domum revertor moestus, atque animo fere</div>
<div class="line">Perturbato, atque incerto prae aegritudine,</div>
<div class="line">Assido, accurrunt servi: succos detrahunt,</div>
<div class="line">Video alios festinare, lectos sternere,</div>
<div class="line">Coenam apparare, pro se quisque sedulo</div>
<div class="line">Faciebant, quo illam mihi lenirent miseriam.</div>
</div>
<q>He came home sorrowful, and troubled in his mind, his servants did all
they possibly could to please him; one pulled off his socks, another made
ready his bed, a third his supper, all did their utmost endeavours to ease
his grief, and exhilarate his person, he was profoundly melancholy, he had
lost his son, <span lang="la">illud angebat</span>, that was his Cordolium, his pain, his agony
which could not be removed.</q>

<p><i>Taedium vitae.</i>] Hence it proceeds many times, that they are weary of their
lives, and feral thoughts to offer violence to their own persons come into
their minds, <span lang="la">taedium vitae</span> is a common symptom, <span lang="la">tarda fluunt, ingrataque
tempora</span>, they are soon tired with all things; they will now tarry, now be
gone; now in bed they will rise, now up, then go to bed, now pleased, then
again displeased; now they like, by and by dislike all, weary of all,
<span lang="la">sequitur nunc vivendi, nunc moriendi cupido</span>, saith Aurelianus, <span class="cite">lib. 1.
cap. 6</span>, but most part <a href="#note2504">[2504]</a><span lang="la">vitam damnant</span>, discontent, disquieted,
perplexed upon every light, or no occasion, object: often tempted, I say,
to make away themselves: <a href="#note2505">[2505]</a><span lang="la">Vivere nolunt, mori nesciunt</span>: they cannot
die, they will not live: they complain, weep, lament, and think they lead a
most miserable life, never was any man so bad, or so before, every poor man
they see is most fortunate in respect of them, every beggar that comes to
the door is happier than they are, they could be contented to change lives
with them, especially if they be alone, idle, and parted from their
ordinary company, molested, displeased, or provoked: grief, fear, agony,
discontent, wearisomeness, laziness, suspicion, or some such passion
forcibly seizeth on them. Yet by and by when they come in company again,
which they like, or be pleased, <span lang="la">suam sententiam rursus damnant, et vitae
solatia delectantur</span>, as Octavius Horatianus observes, <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 5</span>,
they condemn their former mislike, and are well pleased to live. And so
they continue, till with some fresh discontent they be molested again, and
then they are weary of their lives, weary of all, they will die, and show
rather a necessity to live, than a desire. Claudius the emperor, as <a href="#note2506">[2506]</a>
Sueton describes him, had a spice of this disease, for when he was
tormented with the pain of his stomach, he had a conceit to make away
himself. Julius Caesar Claudinus, <span class="cite">consil. 84.</span> had a Polonian to his
patient, so affected, that through <a href="#note2507">[2507]</a>fear and sorrow, with which he
was still disquieted, hated his own life, wished for death every moment,
and to be freed of his misery. Mercurialis another, and another that was
often minded to despatch himself, and so continued for many years.

<p><i>Suspicion, Jealousy.</i>] Suspicion, and jealousy, are general symptoms: they
are commonly distrustful, apt to mistake, and amplify, <span lang="la">facile
irascibiles</span>, <a href="#note2508">[2508]</a>testy, pettish, peevish, and ready to snarl upon every
<a href="#note2509">[2509]</a>small occasion, <span lang="la">cum amicissimis</span>, and without a cause, <span lang="la">datum vel
non datum</span>, it will be <span lang="la">scandalum acceptum</span>. If they speak in jest, he
takes it in good earnest. If they be not saluted, invited, consulted with,
called to counsel, &amp;c., or that any respect, small compliment, or ceremony
be omitted, they think themselves neglected, and contemned; for a time that
tortures them. If two talk together, discourse, whisper, jest, or tell a
tale in general, he thinks presently they mean him, applies all to himself,
<span lang="la">de se putat omnia dici</span>. Or if they talk with him, he is ready to
misconstrue every word they speak, and interpret it to the worst; he cannot
endure any man to look steadily on him, speak to him almost, laugh, jest,
or be familiar, or hem, or point, cough, or spit, or make a noise
sometimes, &amp;c. <a href="#note2510">[2510]</a>He thinks they laugh or point at him, or do it in
disgrace of him, circumvent him, contemn him; every man looks at him, he is
pale, red, sweats for fear and anger, lest somebody should observe him. He
works upon it, and long after this false conceit of an abuse troubles him.
Montanus <span class="cite">consil. 22.</span> gives instance in a melancholy Jew, that was
<span lang="la">Iracundior Adria</span>, so waspish and suspicious, <span lang="la">tam facile iratus</span>, that no
man could tell how to carry himself in his company.

<p><i>Inconstancy.</i>] Inconstant they are in all their actions, vertiginous,
restless, unapt to resolve of any business, they will and will not,
persuaded to and fro upon every small occasion, or word spoken: and yet if
once they be resolved, obstinate, hard to be reconciled. If they abhor,
dislike, or distaste, once settled, though to the better by odds, by no
counsel, or persuasion, to be removed. Yet in most things wavering,
irresolute, unable to deliberate, through fear, <span lang="la">faciunt, et mox facti
poenitent (Areteus) avari, et paulo post prodigi</span>. Now prodigal, and then
covetous, they do, and by-and-by repent them of that which they have done,
so that both ways they are troubled, whether they do or do not, want or
have, hit or miss, disquieted of all hands, soon weary, and still seeking
change, restless, I say, fickle, fugitive, they may not abide to tarry in
one place long.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

no company long, or to persevere in any action or business.

</div>
eftsoons pleased, and anon displeased, as a man that's bitten with fleas,
or that cannot sleep turns to and fro in his bed, their restless minds are
tossed and vary, they have no patience to read out a book, to play out a
game or two, walk a mile, sit an hour, &amp;c., erected and dejected in an
instant; animated to undertake, and upon a word spoken again discouraged.

<p><i>Passionate.</i>] Extreme passionate, <span lang="la">Quicquid volunt valde volunt</span>; and what
they desire, they do most furiously seek; anxious ever, and very
solicitous, distrustful, and timorous, envious, malicious, profuse one
while, sparing another, but most part covetous, muttering, repining,
discontent, and still complaining, grudging, peevish, <span lang="la">injuriarum tenaces</span>,
prone to revenge, soon troubled, and most violent in all their
imaginations, not affable in speech, or apt to vulgar compliment, but
surly, dull, sad, austere; <span lang="la">cogitabundi</span> still, very intent, and as <a href="#note2513">[2513]</a>
Albertus Durer paints melancholy, like a sad woman leaning on her arm with
fixed looks, neglected habit, &amp;c., held therefore by some proud, soft,
sottish, or half-mad, as the Abderites esteemed of Democritus: and yet of a
deep reach, excellent apprehension, judicious, wise, and witty: for I am of
that <a href="#note2514">[2514]</a>nobleman's mind, <q>Melancholy advanceth men's conceits, more
than any humour whatsoever,</q> improves their meditations more than any
strong drink or sack. They are of profound judgment in some things,
although in others <span lang="la">non recte judicant inquieti</span>, saith Fracastorius, <span class="cite">lib.
2. de Intell</span>. And as Arculanus, <span class="cite">c. 16. in 9. Rhasis</span>, terms it, <span lang="la">Judicium
plerumque perversum, corrupti, cum judicant honesta inhonesta, et amicitiam
habent pro inimicitia</span>: they count honesty dishonesty, friends as enemies,
they will abuse their best friends, and dare not offend their enemies.
Cowards most part <span lang="la">et ad inferendam injuriam timidissimi</span>, saith Cardan,
<span class="cite">lib. 8. cap. 4. de rerum varietate</span>: loath to offend, and if they chance to
overshoot themselves in word or deed: or any small business or circumstance
be omitted, forgotten, they are miserably tormented, and frame a thousand
dangers and inconveniences to themselves, <span lang="la">ex musca elephantem</span>, if once
they conceit it: overjoyed with every good rumour, tale, or prosperous
event, transported beyond themselves: with every small cross again, bad
news, misconceived injury, loss, danger, afflicted beyond measure, in great
agony, perplexed, dejected, astonished, impatient, utterly undone: fearful,
suspicious of all. Yet again, many of them desperate harebrains, rash,
careless, fit to be assassinates, as being void of all fear and sorrow,
according to <a href="#note2515">[2515]</a>Hercules de Saxonia, <q>Most audacious, and such as
dare walk alone in the night, through deserts and dangerous places, fearing
none.</q>

<p><i>Amorous</i>.] <q>They are prone to love,</q> and <a href="#note2516">[2516]</a>easy to be taken;
<span lang="la">Propensi ad amorem et excandescentiam</span> (Montaltus <span class="cite">cap. 21.</span>) quickly
enamoured, and dote upon all, love one dearly, till they see another, and
then dote on her, <span lang="la">Et hanc, et hanc, et illam, et omnes</span>, the present moves
most, and the last commonly they love best. Yet some again <span lang="la">Anterotes</span>,
cannot endure the sight of a woman, abhor the sex, as that same melancholy
<a href="#note2517">[2517]</a>duke of Muscovy, that was instantly sick, if he came but in sight of
them; and that <a href="#note2518">[2518]</a>Anchorite, that fell into a cold palsy, when a woman
was brought before him.

<p><i>Humorous</i>.] Humorous they are beyond all measure, sometimes profusely
laughing, extraordinarily merry, and then again weeping without a cause,
(which is familiar with many gentlewomen,) groaning, sighing, pensive, sad,
almost distracted, <span lang="la">multa absurda fingunt, et a ratione aliena</span> (saith
<a href="#note2519">[2519]</a>Frambesarius), they feign many absurdities, vain, void of reason:
one supposeth himself to be a dog, cock, bear, horse, glass, butter, &amp;c. He
is a giant, a dwarf, as strong as an hundred men, a lord, duke, prince, &amp;c.
And if he be told he hath a stinking breath, a great nose, that he is sick,
or inclined to such or such a disease, he believes it eftsoons, and
peradventure by force of imagination will work it out. Many of them are
immovable, and fixed in their conceits, others vary upon every object,
heard or seen. If they see a stage-play, they run upon that a week after; if
they hear music, or see dancing, they have nought but bagpipes in their
brain: if they see a combat, they are all for arms. <a href="#note2520">[2520]</a>If abused, an
abuse troubles them long after; if crossed, that cross, &amp;c. Restless in
their thoughts and actions, continually meditating, <span lang="la">Velut aegri somnia,
vanae finguntur species</span>; more like dreams, than men awake, they fain a
company of antic, fantastical conceits, they have most frivolous thoughts,
impossible to be effected; and sometimes think verily they hear and see
present before their eyes such phantasms or goblins, they fear, suspect, or
conceive, they still talk with, and follow them. In fine, <span lang="la">cogitationes
somniantibus similes, id vigilant, quod alii somniant cogitabundi</span>, still,
saith Avicenna, they wake, as others dream, and such for the most part are
their imaginations and conceits, <a href="#note2521">[2521]</a>absurd, vain, foolish toys, yet
they are <a href="#note2522">[2522]</a>most curious and solicitous, continual, <span lang="la">et supra modum</span>,
Rhasis <span class="cite">cont. lib. 1. cap. 9.</span> <span lang="la">praemeditantur de aliqua re</span>. As serious in a
toy, as if it were a most necessary business, of great moment, importance,
and still, still, still thinking of it: <span lang="la">saeviunt in se</span>, macerating
themselves. Though they do talk with you, and seem to be otherwise
employed, and to your thinking very intent and busy, still that toy runs in
their mind, that fear, that suspicion, that abuse, that jealousy, that
agony, that vexation, that cross, that castle in the air, that crotchet,
that whimsy, that fiction, that pleasant waking dream, whatsoever it is.
<span lang="la">Nec interrogant</span> (saith <a href="#note2523">[2523]</a>Fracastorius) <span lang="la">nec interrogatis recte
respondent</span>. They do not much heed what you say, their mind is on another
matter; ask what you will, they do not attend, or much intend that business
they are about, but forget themselves what they are saying, doing, or
should otherwise say or do, whither they are going, distracted with their
own melancholy thoughts. One laughs upon a sudden, another smiles to
himself, a third frowns, calls, his lips go still, he acts with his hand as
he walks, &amp;c. 'Tis proper to all melancholy men, saith <a href="#note2524">[2524]</a>Mercurialis,
<span class="cite">con. 11.</span> <q>What conceit they have once entertained, to be most intent,
violent, and continually about it.</q> <span lang="la">Invitas occurrit</span>, do what they may
they cannot be rid of it, against their wills they must think of it a
thousand times over, <span lang="la">Perpetuo molestantur nec oblivisci possunt</span>, they are
continually troubled with it, in company, out of company; at meat, at
exercise, at all times and places, <a href="#note2525">[2525]</a><span lang="la">non desinunt ea, quae, minime
volunt, cogitare</span>, if it be offensive especially, they cannot forget it,
they may not rest or sleep for it, but still tormenting themselves,
<span lang="la">Sysiphi saxum volvunt sibi ipsis</span>, as <a href="#note2526">[2526]</a>Brunner observes, <span lang="la">Perpetua
calamitas et miserabile flagellum</span>.

<p><i>Bashfulness.</i>] <a href="#note2527">[2527]</a>Crato, <a href="#note2528">[2528]</a>Laurentius, and Fernelius, put
bashfulness for an ordinary symptom, <span lang="la">sabrusticus pudor</span>, or <span lang="la">vitiosus
pudor</span>, is a thing which much haunts and torments them. If they have been
misused, derided, disgraced, chidden, &amp;c., or by any perturbation of mind,
misaffected, it so far troubles them, that they become quite moped many
times, and so disheartened, dejected, they dare not come abroad, into
strange companies especially, or manage their ordinary affairs, so
childish, timorous, and bashful, they can look no man in the face; some are
more disquieted in this kind, some less, longer some, others shorter, by
fits, &amp;c., though some on the other side (according to <a href="#note2529">[2529]</a>Fracastorius)
be <span lang="la">inverecundi et pertinaces</span>, impudent and peevish. But most part they
are very shamefaced, and that makes them with Pet. Blesensis, Christopher
Urswick, and many such, to refuse honours, offices, and preferments, which
sometimes fall into their mouths, they cannot speak, or put forth
themselves as others can, <span lang="la">timor hos, pudor impedit illos</span>, timorousness
and bashfulness hinder their proceedings, they are contented with their
present estate, unwilling to undertake any office, and therefore never
likely to rise. For that cause they seldom visit their friends, except some
familiars: <span lang="la">pauciloqui</span>, of few words, and oftentimes wholly silent. <a href="#note2530">[2530]</a>
Frambeserius, a Frenchman, had two such patients, <span lang="la">omnino taciturnos</span>,
their friends could not get them to speak: Rodericus a Fonseca <span class="cite">consult.
tom. 2. 85. consil.</span> gives instance in a young man, of twenty-seven years
of age, that was frequently silent, bashful, moped, solitary, that would
not eat his meat, or sleep, and yet again by fits apt to be angry, &amp;c.

<p><i>Solitariness.</i>] Most part they are, as Plater notes, <span lang="la">desides, taciturni,
aegre impulsi, nec nisi coacti procedunt</span>, &amp;c. they will scarce be compelled
to do that which concerns them, though it be for their good, so diffident,
so dull, of small or no compliment, unsociable, hard to be acquainted with,
especially of strangers; they had rather write their minds than speak, and
above all things love solitariness. <span lang="la">Ob voluptatem, an ob timorem soli
sunt</span>? Are they so solitary for pleasure (one asks,) or pain? for both; yet
I rather think for fear and sorrow, &amp;c.

They delight in floods and waters, desert places, to walk alone in
orchards, gardens, private walks, back lanes, averse from company, as
Diogenes in his tub, or Timon Misanthropus <a href="#note2533">[2533]</a>, they abhor all
companions at last, even their nearest acquaintances and most familiar
friends, for they have a conceit (I say) every man observes them, will
deride, laugh to scorn, or misuse them, confining themselves therefore
wholly to their private houses or chambers, <span lang="la">fugiunt homines sine causa</span>
(saith Rhasis) <span lang="la">et odio habent</span>, <span class="cite">cont. l. 1. c. 9.</span> they will diet
themselves, feed and live alone. It was one of the chiefest reasons why the
citizens of Abdera suspected Democritus to be melancholy and mad, because
that, as Hippocrates related in his Epistle to Philopaemenes, <a href="#note2534">[2534]</a><q>he
forsook the city, lived in groves and hollow trees, upon a green bank by a
brook side, or confluence of waters all day long, and all night.</q> <span lang="la">Quae
quidem</span> (saith he) <span lang="la">plurimum atra bile vexatis et melancholicis eveniunt,
deserta frequentant, hominumque congressum aversantur</span>; <a href="#note2535">[2535]</a>which is an
ordinary thing with melancholy men. The Egyptians therefore in their
hieroglyphics expressed a melancholy man by a hare sitting in her form, as
being a most timorous and solitary creature, Pierius <span class="cite">Hieroglyph. l. 12.</span>
But this, and all precedent symptoms, are more or less apparent, as the
humour is intended or remitted, hardly perceived in some, or not all, most
manifest in others. Childish in some, terrible in others; to be derided in
one, pitied or admired in another; to him by fits, to a second continuate:
and howsoever these symptoms be common and incident to all persons, yet
they are the more remarkable, frequent, furious and violent in melancholy
men. To speak in a word, there is nothing so vain, absurd, ridiculous,
extravagant, impossible, incredible, so monstrous a chimera, so prodigious
and strange, <a href="#note2536">[2536]</a>such as painters and poets durst not attempt, which
they will not really fear, feign, suspect and imagine unto themselves: and
that which <a href="#note2537">[2537]</a>Lod. Vives said in a jest of a silly country fellow, that
killed his ass for drinking up the moon, <span lang="la">ut lunam mundo redderet</span>, you may
truly say of them in earnest; they will act, conceive all extremes,
contrarieties, and contradictions, and that in infinite varieties.
<span lang="la">Melancholici plane incredibilia sibi persuadent, ut vix omnibus saeculis
duo reperti sint, qui idem imaginati sint (Erastus de Lamiis)</span>, scarce two
of two thousand that concur in the same symptoms. The tower of Babel never
yielded such confusion of tongues, as the chaos of melancholy doth variety
of symptoms. There is in all melancholy <span lang="la">similitudo dissimilis</span>, like men's
faces, a disagreeing likeness still; and as in a river we swim in the same
place, though not in the same numerical water; as the same instrument
affords several lessons, so the same disease yields diversity of symptoms.
Which howsoever they be diverse, intricate, and hard to be confined, I will
adventure yet in such a vast confusion and generality to bring them into
some order; and so descend to particulars.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="1.3.1.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Particular Symptoms from the influence of Stars, parts of the Body, and Humours</i>.</h4>

<p>Some men have peculiar symptoms, according to their temperament and crisis,
which they had from the stars and those celestial influences, variety of
wits and dispositions, as Anthony Zara contends, <span class="cite">Anat. ingen. sect. 1.
memb. 11, 12, 13, 14.</span> <span lang="la">plurimum irritant influentiae, caelestes, unde
cientur animi aegritudines et morbi corporum</span>. <a href="#note2538">[2538]</a>One saith, diverse
diseases of the body and mind proceed from their influences, <a href="#note2539">[2539]</a>as I
have already proved out of Ptolemy, Pontanus, Lemnius, Cardan, and others
as they are principal significators of manners, diseases, mutually
irradiated, or lords of the geniture, &amp;c. Ptolomeus in his centiloquy,
Hermes, or whosoever else the author of that tract, attributes all these
symptoms, which are in melancholy men, to celestial influences: which
opinion Mercurialis <span class="cite">de affect, lib. cap. 10.</span> rejects; but, as I say,
<a href="#note2540">[2540]</a>Jovianus Pontanus and others stiffly defend. That some are solitary,
dull, heavy, churlish; some again blithe, buxom, light, and merry, they
ascribe wholly to the stars. As if Saturn be predominant in his nativity,
and cause melancholy in his temperature, then <a href="#note2541">[2541]</a>he shall be very
austere, sullen, churlish, black of colour, profound in his cogitations,
full of cares, miseries, and discontents, sad and fearful, always silent,
solitary, still delighting in husbandry, in woods, orchards, gardens,
rivers, ponds, pools, dark walks and close: <span lang="la">Cogitationes sunt velle
aedificare, velle arbores plantare, agros colere</span>, &amp;c. To catch birds,
fishes, &amp;c. still contriving and musing of such matters. If Jupiter
domineers, they are more ambitious, still meditating of kingdoms,
magistracies, offices, honours, or that they are princes, potentates, and
how they would carry themselves, &amp;c. If Mars, they are all for wars, brave
combats, monomachies, testy, choleric, harebrain, rash, furious, and
violent in their actions. They will feign themselves victors, commanders,
are passionate and satirical in their speeches, great braggers, ruddy of
colour. And though they be poor in show, vile and base, yet like Telephus
and Peleus in the <a href="#note2542">[2542]</a>poet, <span lang="la">Ampullas jactant et sesquipedalia verba</span>,
<q>forget their swelling and gigantic words,</q> their mouths are full of
myriads, and tetrarchs at their tongues' end. If the sun, they will be
lords, emperors, in conceit at least, and monarchs, give offices, honours,
&amp;c. If Venus, they are still courting of their mistresses, and most apt to
love, amorously given, they seem to hear music, plays, see fine pictures,
dancers, merriments, and the like. Ever in love, and dote on all they see.
Mercurialists are solitary, much in contemplation, subtle, poets,
philosophers, and musing most part about such matters. If the moon have a
hand, they are all for peregrinations, sea voyages, much affected with
travels, to discourse, read, meditate of such things; wandering in their
thoughts, diverse, much delighting in waters, to fish, fowl, &amp;c.

<p>But the most immediate symptoms proceed from the temperature itself, and
the organical parts, as head, liver, spleen, mesaraic veins, heart, womb,
stomach, &amp;c., and most especially from distemperature of spirits (which, as
<a href="#note2543">[2543]</a>Hercules de Saxonia contends, are wholly immaterial), or from the
four humours in those seats, whether they be hot or cold, natural,
unnatural, innate or adventitious, intended or remitted, simple or mixed,
their diverse mixtures, and several adustions, combinations, which may be
as diversely varied, as those <a href="#note2544">[2544]</a>four first qualities in <a href="#note2545">[2545]</a>
Clavius, and produce as many several symptoms and monstrous fictions as
wine doth effect, which as Andreas Bachius observes, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de vino,
cap. 20.</span> are infinite. Of greater note be these.

<p>If it be natural melancholy, as Lod. Mercatus, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 17. de
melan.</span> T. Bright. <span class="cite">c. 16.</span> hath largely described, either of the spleen, or
of the veins, faulty by excess of quantity, or thickness of substance, it
is a cold and dry humour, as Montanus affirms, <span class="cite">consil. 26</span> the parties
are sad, timorous and fearful. Prosper Calenus, in his book <span class="cite">de atra bile</span>,
will have them to be more stupid than ordinary, cold, heavy, solitary,
sluggish. <span lang="la">Si multam atram bilem et frigidam habent</span>. Hercules de Saxonia,
<span class="cite">c. 19. l. 7.</span> <a href="#note2546">[2546]</a><q>holds these that are naturally melancholy, to be
of a leaden colour or black,</q> and so doth Guianerius, <span class="cite">c. 3. tract. 15.</span>
and such as think themselves dead many times, or that they see, talk with
black men, dead men, spirits and goblins frequently, if it be in excess.
These symptoms vary according to the mixture of those four humours adust,
which is unnatural melancholy. For as Trallianus hath written, <span class="cite">cap. 16.
l. 7.</span> <a href="#note2547">[2547]</a><q>There is not one cause of this melancholy, nor one humour
which begets, but divers diversely intermixed, from whence proceeds this
variety of symptoms:</q> and those varying again as they are hot or cold.
<a href="#note2548">[2548]</a><q>Cold melancholy</q> (saith Benedic. Vittorius Faventinus <span class="cite">pract. mag.</span>)
<q>is a cause of dotage, and more mild symptoms, if hot or more adust, of more
violent passions, and furies.</q> Fracastorius, <span class="cite">l. 2. de intellect.</span> will
have us to consider well of it, <a href="#note2549">[2549]</a><q>with what kind of melancholy every
one is troubled, for it much avails to know it; one is enraged by fervent
heat, another is possessed by sad and cold; one is fearful, shamefaced; the
other impudent and bold;</q> as Ajax, <span lang="la">Arma rapit superosque furens inpraelia
poscit</span>: quite mad or tending to madness. <span lang="la">Nunc hos, nunc impetit illos.</span>
Bellerophon on the other side, <span lang="la">solis errat male sanus in agris</span>, wanders
alone in the woods; one despairs, weeps, and is weary of his life, another
laughs, &amp;c. All which variety is produced from the several degrees of heat
and cold, which <a href="#note2550">[2550]</a>Hercules de Saxonia will have wholly proceed from
the distemperature of spirits alone, animal especially, and those
immaterial, the next and immediate causes of melancholy, as they are hot,
cold, dry, moist, and from their agitation proceeds that diversity of
symptoms, which he reckons up, in the <a href="#note2551">[2551]</a>thirteenth chap. of his Tract
of Melancholy, and that largely through every part. Others will have them
come from the diverse adustion of the four humours, which in this unnatural
melancholy, by corruption of blood, adust choler, or melancholy natural,
<a href="#note2552">[2552]</a><q>by excessive distemper of heat turned, in comparison of the
natural, into a sharp lye by force of adustion, cause, according to the
diversity of their matter, diverse and strange symptoms,</q> which T. Bright
reckons up in his following chapter. So doth <a href="#note2553">[2553]</a>Arculanus, according to
the four principal humours adust, and many others.

<p>For example, if it proceed from phlegm, (which is seldom and not so
frequently as the rest) <a href="#note2554">[2554]</a>it stirs up dull symptoms, and a kind of
stupidity, or impassionate hurt: they are sleepy, saith <a href="#note2555">[2555]</a>Savanarola,
dull, slow, cold, blockish, ass-like, <span lang="la">Asininam melancholiam</span>, <a href="#note2556">[2556]</a>
Melancthon calls it, <q>they are much given to weeping, and delight in
waters, ponds, pools, rivers, fishing, fowling, &amp;c.</q> (Arnoldus <span class="cite">breviar.
1. cap. 18.</span>) They are <a href="#note2557">[2557]</a>pale of colour, slothful, apt to sleep,
heavy; <a href="#note2558">[2558]</a>much troubled with headache, continual meditation, and
muttering to themselves; they dream of waters, <a href="#note2559">[2559]</a>that they are in
danger of drowning, and fear such things, Rhasis. They are fatter than
others that are melancholy, of a muddy complexion, apter to spit, <a href="#note2560">[2560]</a>
sleep, more troubled with rheum than the rest, and have their eyes still
fixed on the ground. Such a patient had Hercules de Saxonia, a widow in
Venice, that was fat and very sleepy still; Christophorus a Vega another
affected in the same sort. If it be inveterate or violent, the symptoms are
more evident, they plainly denote and are ridiculous to others, in all
their gestures, actions, speeches; imagining impossibilities, as he in
Christophorus a Vega, that thought he was a tun of wine, <a href="#note2561">[2561]</a>and that
Siennois, that resolved within himself not to piss, for fear he should
drown all the town.

<p>If it proceed from blood adust, or that there be a mixture of blood in it,
<a href="#note2562">[2562]</a><q>such are commonly ruddy of complexion, and high-coloured,</q>
according to Salust. Salvianus, and Hercules de Saxonia. And as Savanarola,
Vittorius Faventinus Emper. farther adds, <a href="#note2563">[2563]</a><q>the veins of their eyes
be red, as well as their faces.</q> They are much inclined to laughter, witty
and merry, conceited in discourse, pleasant, if they be not far gone, much
given to music, dancing, and to be in women's company. They meditate wholly
on such things, and think <a href="#note2564">[2564]</a><q>they see or hear plays, dancing, and
suchlike sports</q> (free from all fear and sorrow, as <a href="#note2565">[2565]</a>Hercules de
Saxonia supposeth.) If they be more strongly possessed with this kind of
melancholy, Arnoldus adds, <span class="cite">Breviar. lib. 1. cap. 18.</span> Like him of Argos
in the Poet, that sate laughing <a href="#note2566">[2566]</a>all day long, as if he had been at a
theatre. Such another is mentioned by <a href="#note2567">[2567]</a>Aristotle, living at Abydos, a
town of Asia Minor, that would sit after the same fashion, as if he had
been upon a stage, and sometimes act himself; now clap his hands, and
laugh, as if he had been well pleased with the sight. Wolfius relates of a
country fellow called Brunsellius, subject to this humour, <a href="#note2568">[2568]</a><q>that
being by chance at a sermon, saw a woman fall off from a form half asleep,
at which object most of the company laughed, but he for his part was so
much moved, that for three whole days after he did nothing but laugh, by
which means he was much weakened, and worse a long time following.</q> Such a
one was old Sophocles, and Democritus himself had <span lang="la">hilare delirium</span>, much
in this vein. Laurentius <span class="cite">cap. 3. de melan.</span> thinks this kind of
melancholy, which is a little adust with some mixture of blood, to be that
which Aristotle meant, when he said melancholy men of all others are most
witty, which causeth many times a divine ravishment, and a kind of
<span lang="la">enthusiasmus</span>, which stirreth them up to be excellent philosophers, poets,
prophets, &amp;c. Mercurialis, <span class="cite">consil. 110.</span> gives instance in a young man his
patient, sanguine melancholy, <a href="#note2569">[2569]</a><q>of a great wit, and excellently
learned.</q>

<p>If it arise from choler adust, they are bold and impudent, and of a more
harebrain disposition, apt to quarrel, and think of such things, battles,
combats, and their manhood, furious; impatient in discourse, stiff,
irrefragable and prodigious in their tenets; and if they be moved, most
violent, outrageous, <a href="#note2570">[2570]</a>ready to disgrace, provoke any, to kill
themselves and others; Arnoldus adds, stark mad by fits, <a href="#note2571">[2571]</a><q>they sleep
little, their urine is subtle and fiery.</q> (Guianerius.) <q>In their fits you
shall hear them speak all manner of languages, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin,
that never were taught or knew them before.</q> Apponensis in <span class="cite">com. in Pro.
sec. 30.</span> speaks of a mad woman that spake excellent good Latin: and Rhasis
knew another, that could prophecy in her fit, and foretell things truly to
come. <a href="#note2572">[2572]</a>Guianerius had a patient could make Latin verses when the moon
was combust, otherwise illiterate. Avicenna and some of his adherents will
have these symptoms, when they happen, to proceed from the devil, and that
they are rather <span lang="la">demoniaci</span>, possessed, than mad or melancholy, or both
together, as Jason Pratensis thinks, <span lang="la">Immiscent se mali genii</span>, &amp;c. but
most ascribe it to the humour, which opinion Montaltus <span class="cite">cap. 21.</span> stiffly
maintains, confuting Avicenna and the rest, referring it wholly to the
quality and disposition of the humour and subject. Cardan <span class="cite">de rerum var.
lib. 8. cap. 10.</span> holds these men of all others fit to be assassins,
bold, hardy, fierce, and adventurous, to undertake anything by reason of
their choler adust. <a href="#note2573">[2573]</a><q>This humour, saith he, prepares them to endure
death itself, and all manner of torments with invincible courage, and 'tis
a wonder to see with what alacrity they will undergo such tortures,</q> <span lang="la">ut
supra naturam res videatur</span>: he ascribes this generosity, fury, or rather
stupidity, to this adustion of choler and melancholy: but I take these
rather to be mad or desperate, than properly melancholy; for commonly this
humour so adust and hot, degenerates into madness.

<p>If it come from melancholy itself adust, those men, saith Avicenna, <a href="#note2574">[2574]</a>
<q>are usually sad and solitary, and that continually, and in excess, more
than ordinarily suspicious more fearful, and have long, sore, and most
corrupt imaginations;</q> cold and black, bashful, and so solitary, that as
<a href="#note2575">[2575]</a>Arnoldus writes, <q>they will endure no company, they dream of graves
still, and dead men, and think themselves bewitched or dead:</q> if it be
extreme, they think they hear hideous noises, see and talk <a href="#note2576">[2576]</a><q>with
black men, and converse familiarly with devils, and such strange chimeras
and visions,</q> (Gordonius) or that they are possessed by them, that somebody
talks to them, or within them. <span lang="la">Tales melancholici plerumque daemoniaci</span>,
Montaltus <span class="cite">consil. 26. ex Avicenna</span>. Valescus de Taranta had such a woman in
cure, <a href="#note2577">[2577]</a><q>that thought she had to do with the devil:</q> and Gentilis
Fulgosus <span class="cite">quaest. 55.</span> writes that he had a melancholy friend, that <a href="#note2578">[2578]</a>
<q>had a black man in the likeness of a soldier</q> still following him
wheresoever he was. Laurentius <span class="cite">cap. 7.</span> hath many stories of such as have
thought themselves bewitched by their enemies; and some that would eat no
meat as being dead. <a href="#note2579">[2579]</a><i>Anno</i> 1550 an advocate of Paris fell into such a
melancholy fit, that he believed verily he was dead, he could not be
persuaded otherwise, or to eat or drink, till a kinsman of his, a scholar
of Bourges, did eat before him dressed like a corse. The story, saith
Serres, was acted in a comedy before Charles the Ninth. Some think they are
beasts, wolves, hogs, and cry like dogs, foxes, bray like asses, and low
like kine, as King Praetus' daughters. <a href="#note2580">[2580]</a>Hildesheim <span class="cite">spicel. 2. de
mania</span>, hath an example of a Dutch baron so affected, and Trincavelius
<span class="cite">lib. 1. consil. 11.</span> another of a nobleman in his country, <a href="#note2581">[2581]</a><q>that
thought he was certainly a beast, and would imitate most of their voices,</q>
with many such symptoms, which may properly be reduced to this kind.

<p>If it proceed from the several combinations of these four humours, or
spirits, Herc. de Saxon. adds hot, cold, dry, moist, dark, confused,
settled, constringed, as it participates of matter, or is without matter,
the symptoms are likewise mixed. One thinks himself a giant, another a
dwarf. One is heavy as lead, another is as light as a feather. Marcellus
Donatus <span class="cite">l. 2. cap. 41.</span> makes mention out of Seneca, of one Seneccio, a
rich man, <a href="#note2582">[2582]</a><q>that thought himself and everything else he had, great:
great wife, great horses, could not abide little things, but would have
great pots to drink in, great hose, and great shoes bigger than his feet.</q>
Like her in <a href="#note2583">[2583]</a>Trallianus, that supposed she <q>could shake all the world
with her finger,</q> and was afraid to clinch her hand together, lest she
should crush the world like an apple in pieces: or him in Galen, that
thought he was <a href="#note2584">[2584]</a>Atlas, and sustained heaven with his shoulders.
Another thinks himself so little, that he can creep into a mouse-hole: one
fears heaven will fall on his head: a second is a cock; and such a one,
<a href="#note2585">[2585]</a>Guianerius saith he saw at Padua, that would clap his hands together
and crow. <a href="#note2586">[2586]</a>Another thinks he is a nightingale, and therefore sings
all the night long; another he is all glass, a pitcher, and will therefore
let nobody come near him, and such a one <a href="#note2587">[2587]</a>Laurentius gives out upon
his credit, that he knew in France. Christophorus a Vega <span class="cite">cap. 3. lib. 14.</span>
Skenkius and Marcellus Donatus <span class="cite">l. 2. cap. 1.</span> have many such examples, and
one amongst the rest of a baker in Ferrara that thought he was composed of
butter, and durst not sit in the sun, or come near the fire for fear of
being melted: of another that thought he was a case of leather, stuffed
with wind. Some laugh, weep; some are mad, some dejected, moped, in much
agony, some by fits, others continuate, &amp;c. Some have a corrupt ear, they
think they hear music, or some hideous noise as their phantasy conceives,
corrupt eyes, some smelling, some one sense, some another. <a href="#note2588">[2588]</a>Lewis the
Eleventh had a conceit everything did stink about him, all the odoriferous
perfumes they could get, would not ease him, but still he smelled a filthy
stink. A melancholy French poet in <a href="#note2589">[2589]</a>Laurentius, being sick of a
fever, and troubled with waking, by his physicians was appointed to use
<span lang="la">unguentum populeum</span> to anoint his temples; but he so distasted the smell
of it, that for many years after, all that came near him he imagined to
scent of it, and would let no man talk with him but aloof off, or wear any
new clothes, because he thought still they smelled of it; in all other
things wise and discreet, he would talk sensibly, save only in this. A
gentleman in Limousin, saith Anthony Verdeur, was persuaded he had but one
leg, affrighted by a wild boar, that by chance struck him on the leg; he
could not be satisfied his leg was sound (in all other things well) until
two Franciscans by chance coming that way, fully removed him from the
conceit. <span lang="la">Sed abunde fabularum audivimus</span>,&mdash;enough of story-telling.

<h4><a name="1.3.1.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Symptoms from Education, Custom, continuance of Time, our Condition, mixed with other Diseases, by Fits, Inclination, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Another great occasion of the variety of these symptoms proceeds from
custom, discipline, education, and several inclinations, <a href="#note2590">[2590]</a><q>this
humour will imprint in melancholy men the objects most answerable to their
condition of life, and ordinary actions, and dispose men according to their
several studies and callings.</q> If an ambitious man become melancholy, he
forthwith thinks he is a king, an emperor, a monarch, and walks alone,
pleasing himself with a vain hope of some future preferment, or present as
he supposeth, and withal acts a lord's part, takes upon him to be some
statesman or magnifico, makes conges, gives entertainment, looks big, &amp;c.
Francisco Sansovino records of a melancholy man in Cremona, that would not
be induced to believe but that he was pope, gave pardons, made cardinals,
&amp;c. <a href="#note2591">[2591]</a>Christophorus a Vega makes mention of another of his
acquaintance, that thought he was a king, driven from his kingdom, and was
very anxious to recover his estate. A covetous person is still conversant
about purchasing of lands and tenements, plotting in his mind how to
compass such and such manors, as if he were already lord of, and able to go
through with it; all he sees is his, <span lang="la">re</span> or <span lang="la">spe</span>, he hath devoured it in
hope, or else in conceit esteems it his own: like him in <a href="#note2592">[2592]</a>Athenaeus,
that thought all the ships in the haven to be his own. A lascivious
<span lang="la">inamorato</span> plots all the day long to please his mistress, acts and struts,
and carries himself as if she were in presence, still dreaming of her, as
Pamphilus of his Glycerium, or as some do in their morning sleep. <a href="#note2593">[2593]</a>
Marcellus Donatus knew such a gentlewoman in Mantua, called Elionora
Meliorina, that constantly believed she was married to a king, and <a href="#note2594">[2594]</a>
<q>would kneel down and talk with him, as if he had been there present with
his associates; and if she had found by chance a piece of glass in a
muck-hill or in the street, she would say that it was a jewel sent from her
lord and husband.</q> If devout and religious, he is all for fasting, prayer,
ceremonies, alms, interpretations, visions, prophecies, revelations, <a href="#note2595">[2595]</a>
he is inspired by the Holy Ghost, full of the spirit: one while he is
saved, another while damned, or still troubled in mind for his sins, the
devil will surely have him, &amp;c. more of these in the third partition of
love-melancholy. <a href="#note2596">[2596]</a>A scholar's mind is busied about his studies, he
applauds himself for that he hath done, or hopes to do, one while fearing
to be out in his next exercise, another while contemning all censures;
envies one, emulates another; or else with indefatigable pains and
meditation, consumes himself. So of the rest, all which vary according to
the more remiss and violent impression of the object, or as the humour
itself is intended or remitted. For some are so gently melancholy, that in
all their carriage, and to the outward apprehension of others it can hardly
be discerned, yet to them an intolerable burden, and not to be endured.
<a href="#note2597">[2597]</a><span lang="la">Quaedam occulta quaedam manifesta</span>, some signs are manifest and
obvious to all at all times, some to few, or seldom, or hardly perceived;
let them keep their own council, none will take notice or suspect them.
<q>They do not express in outward show their depraved imaginations,</q> as
<a href="#note2598">[2598]</a>Hercules de Saxonia observes, <q>but conceal them wholly to
themselves, and are very wise men, as I have often seen; some fear, some do
not fear at all, as such as think themselves kings or dead, some have more
signs, some fewer, some great, some less,</q> some vex, fret, still fear,
grieve, lament, suspect, laugh, sing, weep, chafe, &amp;c. by fits (as I have
said) or more during and permanent. Some dote in one thing, are most
childish, and ridiculous, and to be wondered at in that, and yet for all
other matters most discreet and wise. To some it is in disposition, to
another in habit; and as they write of heat and cold, we may say of this
humour, one is <span lang="la">melancholicus ad octo</span>, a second two degrees less, a third
halfway. 'Tis superparticular, <span lang="la">sesquialtera, sesquitertia</span>, and
<span lang="la">superbipartiens tertias, quintas Melancholiae</span>, &amp;c. all those geometrical
proportions are too little to express it. <a href="#note2599">[2599]</a><q>It comes to many by fits,
and goes; to others it is continuate:</q> many (saith <a href="#note2600">[2600]</a>Faventinus) <q>in
spring and fall only are molested,</q> some once a year, as that Roman <a href="#note2601">[2601]</a>
Galen speaks of: <a href="#note2602">[2602]</a>one, at the conjunction of the moon alone, or some
unfortunate aspects, at such and such set hours and times, like the
sea-tides, to some women when they be with child, as <a href="#note2603">[2603]</a>Plater notes,
never otherwise: to others 'tis settled and fixed; to one led about and
variable still by that <span lang="la">ignis fatuus</span> of phantasy, like an <span lang="la">arthritis</span> or
running gout, 'tis here and there, and in every joint, always molesting
some part or other; or if the body be free, in a myriad of forms exercising
the mind. A second once peradventure in his life hath a most grievous fit,
once in seven years, once in five years, even to the extremity of madness,
death, or dotage, and that upon, some feral accident or perturbation,
terrible object, and for a time, never perhaps so before, never after. A
third is moved upon all such troublesome objects, cross fortune, disaster,
and violent passions, otherwise free, once troubled in three or four years.
A fourth, if things be to his mind, or he in action, well pleased, in good
company, is most jocund, and of a good complexion: if idle, or alone, a la
mort, or carried away wholly with pleasant dreams and phantasies, but if
once crossed and displeased,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Pectore concipiet nil nisi triste suo;</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">He will imagine naught save sadness in his heart;</div>
</div>
his countenance is altered on a sudden, his heart heavy, irksome thoughts
crucify his soul, and in an instant he is moped or weary of his life, he
will kill himself. A fifth complains in his youth, a sixth in his middle
age, the last in his old age.

<p>Generally thus much we may conclude of melancholy; that it is <a href="#note2604">[2604]</a>most
pleasant at first, I say, <span lang="la">mentis gratissimus error</span>, <a href="#note2605">[2605]</a>a most
delightsome humour, to be alone, dwell alone, walk alone, meditate, lie in
bed whole days, dreaming awake as it were, and frame a thousand
fantastical imaginations unto themselves. They are never better pleased
than when they are so doing, they are in paradise for the time, and cannot
well endure to be interrupt; with him in the poet, <a href="#note2606">[2606]</a><span lang="la">pol me
occidistis amici, non servastis ait</span>? you have undone him, he complains, if
you trouble him: tell him what inconvenience will follow, what will be the
event, all is one, <span lang="la">canis ad vomitum</span>, <a href="#note2607">[2607]</a>'tis so pleasant he cannot
refrain. He may thus continue peradventure many years by reason of a strong
temperature, or some mixture of business, which may divert his cogitations:
but at the last <span lang="la">laesa imaginatio</span>, his phantasy is crazed, and now
habituated to such toys, cannot but work still like a fate, the scene
alters upon a sudden, fear and sorrow supplant those pleasing thoughts,
suspicion, discontent, and perpetual anxiety succeed in their places; so by
little and little, by that shoeing-horn of idleness, and voluntary
solitariness, melancholy this feral fiend is drawn on, <a href="#note2608">[2608]</a><span lang="la">et quantum
vertice ad auras Aethereas, tantum radice in Tartara tendit</span>, <q>extending up,
by its branches, so far towards Heaven, as, by its roots, it does down
towards Tartarus;</q> it was not so delicious at first, as now it is bitter
and harsh; a cankered soul macerated with cares and discontents, <span lang="la">taedium
vitae</span>, impatience, agony, inconstancy, irresolution, precipitate them unto
unspeakable miseries. They cannot endure company, light, or life itself,
some unfit for action, and the like. <a href="#note2609">[2609]</a>Their bodies are lean and dried
up, withered, ugly, their looks harsh, very dull, and their souls
tormented, as they are more or less entangled, as the humour hath been
intended, or according to the continuance of time they have been troubled.

<p>To discern all which symptoms the better, <a href="#note2610">[2610]</a>Rhasis the Arabian makes
three degrees of them. The first is, <span lang="la">falsa cogitatio</span>, false conceits and
idle thoughts: to misconstrue and amplify, aggravating everything they
conceive or fear; the second is, <span lang="la">falso cogitata loqui</span>, to talk to
themselves, or to use inarticulate incondite voices, speeches, obsolete
gestures, and plainly to utter their minds and conceits of their hearts, by
their words and actions, as to laugh, weep, to be silent, not to sleep, eat
their meat, &amp;c.: the third is to put in practice <a href="#note2611">[2611]</a>that which they
think or speak. Savanarola, <span class="cite">Rub. 11. tract. 8. cap. 1. de
aegritudine</span>, confirms as much, <a href="#note2612">[2612]</a><q>when he begins to express that in
words, which he conceives in his heart, or talks idly, or goes from one
thing to another,</q> which <a href="#note2613">[2613]</a>Gordonius calls <span lang="la">nec caput habentia, nec
caudam</span>, (<q>having neither head nor tail,</q>) he is in the middle way: <a href="#note2614">[2614]</a>
<q>but when he begins to act it likewise, and to put his fopperies in
execution, he is then in the extent of melancholy, or madness itself.</q> This
progress of melancholy you shall easily observe in them that have been so
affected, they go smiling to themselves at first, at length they laugh out;
at first solitary, at last they can endure no company: or if they do, they
are now dizzards, past sense and shame, quite moped, they care not what
they say or do, all their actions, words, gestures, are furious or
ridiculous. At first his mind is troubled, he doth not attend what is said,
if you tell him a tale, he cries at last, what said you? but in the end he
mutters to himself, as old women do many times, or old men when they sit
alone, upon a sudden they laugh, whoop, halloo, or run away, and swear they
see or hear players, <a href="#note2615">[2615]</a>devils, hobgoblins, ghosts, strike, or strut,
&amp;c., grow humorous in the end; like him in the poet, <span lang="la">saepe ducentos, saepe
decem servos</span>, (<q>at one time followed by two hundred servants, at another
only by ten</q>) he will dress himself, and undress, careless at last, grows
insensible, stupid, or mad. <a href="#note2616">[2616]</a>He howls like a wolf, barks like a dog,
and raves like Ajax and Orestes, hears music and outcries, which no man
else hears. As <a href="#note2617">[2617]</a>he did whom Amatus Lusitanus mentioneth <span class="cite">cent. 3,
cura. 55</span>, or that woman in <a href="#note2618">[2618]</a>Springer, that spake many languages,
and said she was possessed: that farmer in <a href="#note2619">[2619]</a>Prosper Calenius, that
disputed and discoursed learnedly in philosophy and astronomy, with
Alexander Achilles his master, at Bologna, in Italy. But of these I have
already spoken.

<p>Who can sufficiently speak of these symptoms, or prescribe rules to
comprehend them? as Echo to the painter in Ausonius, <span lang="la">vane quid affectas</span>,
&amp;c., foolish fellow; what wilt? if you must needs paint me, paint a voice,
<span lang="la">et similem si vis pingere, pinge sonum</span>; if you will describe melancholy,
describe a fantastical conceit, a corrupt imagination, vain thoughts and
different, which who can do? The four and twenty letters make no more
variety of words in diverse languages, than melancholy conceits produce
diversity of symptoms in several persons. They are irregular, obscure,
various, so infinite, Proteus himself is not so diverse, you may as well
make the moon a new coat, as a true character of a melancholy man; as soon
find the motion of a bird in the air, as the heart of man, a melancholy
man. They are so confused, I say, diverse, intermixed with other diseases.
As the species be confounded (which <a href="#note2620">[2620]</a>I have showed) so are the
symptoms; sometimes with headache, cachexia, dropsy, stone; as you may
perceive by those several examples and illustrations, collected by <a href="#note2621">[2621]</a>
Hildesheim <span class="cite">spicel. 2.</span> Mercurialis <span class="cite">consil. 118. cap. 6 and 11.</span> with
headache, epilepsy, priapismus. Trincavelius <span class="cite">consil. 12. lib. 1.
consil. 49.</span> with gout: <span lang="la">caninus appetitus</span>. Montanus <span class="cite">consil. 26, &amp;c.
23, 234, 249</span>, with falling-sickness, headache, vertigo, lycanthropia, &amp;c.
J. Caesar Claudinus <span class="cite">consult. 4. consult. 89 and 116.</span> with gout, agues,
haemorrhoids, stone, &amp;c., who can distinguish these melancholy symptoms so
intermixed with others, or apply them to their several kinds, confine them
into method? 'Tis hard I confess, yet I have disposed of them as I could,
and will descend to particularise them according to their species. For
hitherto I have expatiated in more general lists or terms, speaking
promiscuously of such ordinary signs, which occur amongst writers. Not that
they are all to be found in one man, for that were to paint a monster or
chimera, not a man: but some in one, some in another, and that successively
or at several times.

<p>Which I have been the more curious to express and report; not to upbraid
any miserable man, or by way of derision, (I rather pity them,) but the
better to discern, to apply remedies unto them; and to show that the best
and soundest of us all is in great danger; how much we ought to fear our
own fickle estates, remember our miseries and vanities, examine and
humiliate ourselves, seek to God, and call to Him for mercy, that needs not
look for any rods to scourge ourselves, since we carry them in our bowels,
and that our souls are in a miserable captivity, if the light of grace and
heavenly truth doth not shine continually upon us: and by our discretion to
moderate ourselves, to be more circumspect and wary in the midst of these
dangers.

<h4><a name="1.3.2.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Symptoms of Head-Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p><q>If <a href="#note2622">[2622]</a>no symptoms appear about the stomach, nor the blood be
misaffected, and fear and sorrow continue, it is to be thought the brain
itself is troubled, by reason of a melancholy juice bred in it, or
otherwise conveyed into it, and that evil juice is from the distemperature
of the part, or left after some inflammation,</q> thus far Piso. But this is
not always true, for blood and hypochondries both are often affected even
in head-melancholy. <a href="#note2623">[2623]</a>Hercules de Saxonia differs here from the common
current of writers, putting peculiar signs of head-melancholy, from the
sole distemperature of spirits in the brain, as they are hot, cold, dry,
moist, <q>all without matter from the motion alone, and tenebrosity of
spirits;</q> of melancholy which proceeds from humours by adustion, he treats
apart, with their several symptoms and cures. The common signs, if it be by
essence in the head, <q>are ruddiness of face, high sanguine complexion, most
part <span lang="la">rubore saturato</span>,</q> <a href="#note2624">[2624]</a>one calls it, a bluish, and sometimes full
of pimples, with red eyes. Avicenna <span class="cite">l. 3, Fen. 2, Tract. 4, c. 18.</span>
Duretus and others out of Galen, <span class="cite">de affect. l. 3, c. 6.</span> <a href="#note2625">[2625]</a>Hercules
de Saxonia to this of redness of face, adds <q>heaviness of the head, fixed
and hollow eyes.</q> <a href="#note2626">[2626]</a><q>If it proceed from dryness of the brain, then
their heads will be light, vertiginous, and they most apt to wake, and to
continue whole months together without sleep. Few excrements in their eyes
and nostrils, and often bald by reason of excess of dryness,</q> Montaltus
adds, <span class="cite">c. 17.</span> If it proceed from moisture: dullness, drowsiness, headache
follows; and as Salust. Salvianus, <span class="cite">c. 1, l. 2</span>, out of his own
experience found, epileptical, with a multitude of humours in the head.
They are very bashful, if ruddy, apt to blush, and to be red upon all
occasions, <span lang="la">praesertim si metus accesserit</span>. But the chiefest symptom to
discern this species, as I have said, is this, that there be no notable
signs in the stomach, hypochondries, or elsewhere, <span lang="la">digna</span>, as <a href="#note2627">[2627]</a>
Montaltus terms them, or of greater note, because oftentimes the passions
of the stomach concur with them. Wind is common to all three species, and
is not excluded, only that of the hypochondries is <a href="#note2628">[2628]</a>more windy than
the rest, saith Hollerius. Aetius <span class="cite">tetrab. l. 2, sc. 2, c. 9 and 10</span>,
maintains the same, <a href="#note2629">[2629]</a>if there be more signs, and more evident in the
head than elsewhere, the brain is primarily affected, and prescribes
head-melancholy to be cured by meats amongst the rest, void of wind, and
good juice, not excluding wind, or corrupt blood, even in head-melancholy
itself: but these species are often confounded, and so are their symptoms,
as I have already proved. The symptoms of the mind are superfluous and
continual cogitations; <a href="#note2630">[2630]</a><q>for when the head is heated, it scorcheth
the blood, and from thence proceed melancholy fumes, which trouble the
mind,</q> Avicenna. They are very choleric, and soon hot, solitary, sad, often
silent, watchful, discontent, Montaltus, <span class="cite">cap. 24.</span> If anything trouble
them, they cannot sleep, but fret themselves still, till another object
mitigate, or time wear it out. They have grievous passions, and immoderate
perturbations of the mind, fear, sorrow, &amp;c., yet not so continuate, but
that they are sometimes merry, apt to profuse laughter, which is more to be
wondered at, and that by the authority of <a href="#note2631">[2631]</a>Galen himself, by reason
of mixture of blood, <span lang="la">praerubri jocosis delectantur, et irrisores plerumque
sunt</span>, if they be ruddy, they are delighted in jests, and oftentimes
scoffers themselves, conceited: and as Rodericus a Vega comments on that
place of Galen, merry, witty, of a pleasant disposition, and yet grievously
melancholy anon after: <span lang="la">omnia discunt sine doctore</span>, saith Aretus, they
learn without a teacher: and as <a href="#note2632">[2632]</a>Laurentius supposeth, those feral
passions and symptoms of such as think themselves glass, pitchers,
feathers, &amp;c., speak strange languages, <span lang="la">a colore cerebri</span> (if it be in
excess) from the brain's distempered heat.

<h4><a name="1.3.2.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Symptoms of windy Hypochondriacal Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p><q>In this hypochondriacal or flatuous melancholy, the symptoms are so
ambiguous,</q> saith <a href="#note2633">[2633]</a>Crato in a counsel of his for a noblewoman, <q>that
the most exquisite physicians cannot determine of the part affected.</q>
Matthew Flaccius, consulted about a noble matron, confessed as much, that
in this malady he with Hollerius, Fracastorius, Falopius, and others, being
to give their sentence of a party labouring of hypochondriacal melancholy,
could not find out by the symptoms which part was most especially affected;
some said the womb, some heart, some stomach, &amp;c., and therefore Crato,
<span class="cite">consil. 24. lib. 1.</span> boldly avers, that in this diversity of symptoms,
which commonly accompany this disease, <a href="#note2634">[2634]</a><q>no physician can truly say
what part is affected.</q> Galen <span class="cite">lib. 3. de loc. affect.</span>, reckons up these
ordinary symptoms, which all the Neoterics repeat of Diocles; only this
fault he finds with him, that he puts not fear and sorrow amongst the other
signs. Trincavelius excuseth Diocles, <span class="cite">lib. 3. consil. 35.</span> because that
oftentimes in a strong head and constitution, a generous spirit, and a
valiant, these symptoms appear not, by reason of his valour and courage.
<a href="#note2635">[2635]</a>Hercules de Saxonia (to whom I subscribe) is of the same mind (which
I have before touched) that fear and sorrow are not general symptoms; some
fear and are not sad; some be sad and fear not; some neither fear nor
grieve. The rest are these, beside fear and sorrow, <a href="#note2636">[2636]</a><q>sharp
belchings, fulsome crudities, heat in the bowels, wind and rumbling in the
guts, vehement gripings, pain in the belly and stomach sometimes, after
meat that is hard of concoction, much watering of the stomach, and moist
spittle, cold sweat, <span lang="la">importunus sudor</span>, unseasonable sweat all over the
body,</q> as Octavius Horatianus <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 5.</span> calls it; <q>cold joints,
indigestion, <a href="#note2637">[2637]</a>they cannot endure their own fulsome belchings,
continual wind about their hypochondries, heat and griping in their bowels,
<span lang="la">praecordia sursum convelluntur</span>, midriff and bowels are pulled up, the
veins about their eyes look red, and swell from vapours and wind.</q> Their
ears sing now and then, vertigo and giddiness come by fits, turbulent
dreams, dryness, leanness, apt they are to sweat upon all occasions, of all
colours and complexions. Many of them are high-coloured especially after
meals, which symptom Cardinal Caecius was much troubled with, and of which
he complained to Prosper Calenus his physician, he could not eat, or drink
a cup of wine, but he was as red in the face as if he had been at a mayor's
feast. That symptom alone vexeth many. <a href="#note2638">[2638]</a>Some again are black, pale,
ruddy, sometimes their shoulders and shoulder blades ache, there is a
leaping all over their bodies, sudden trembling, a palpitation of the
heart, and that <span lang="la">cardiaca passio</span>, grief in the mouth of the stomach, which
maketh the patient think his heart itself acheth, and sometimes
suffocation, <span lang="la">difficultas anhelitus</span>, short breath, hard wind, strong
pulse, swooning. Montanus <span class="cite">consil. 55.</span> Trincavelius <span class="cite">lib. 3. consil. 36.
et 37.</span> Fernelius <span class="cite">cons. 43.</span> Frambesarius <span class="cite">consult. lib. 1. consil. 17.</span>
Hildesheim, Claudinus, &amp;c., give instance of every particular. The peculiar
symptoms which properly belong to each part be these. If it proceed from
the stomach, saith <a href="#note2639">[2639]</a>Savanarola, 'tis full of pain wind. Guianerius
adds, vertigo, nausea, much spitting, &amp;c. If from the mirach, a swelling
and wind in the hypochondries, a loathing, and appetite to vomit, pulling
upward. If from the heart, aching and trembling of it, much heaviness. If
from the liver, there is usually a pain in the right hypochondry. If from
the spleen, hardness and grief in the left hypochondry, a rumbling, much
appetite and small digestion, Avicenna. If from the mesaraic veins and
liver on the other side, little or no appetite, Herc. de Saxonia. If from
the hypochondries, a rumbling inflation, concoction is hindered, often
belching, &amp;c. And from these crudities, windy vapours ascend up to the
brain which trouble the imagination, and cause fear, sorrow, dullness,
heaviness, many terrible conceits and chimeras, as Lemnius well observes,
<span class="cite">l. 1. c. 16.</span> <q>as <a href="#note2640">[2640]</a>a black and thick cloud covers the sun, and
intercepts his beams and light, so doth this melancholy vapour obnubilate
the mind, enforce it to many absurd thoughts and imaginations,</q> and compel
good, wise, honest, discreet men (arising to the brain from the <a href="#note2641">[2641]</a>
lower parts, <q>as smoke out of a chimney</q>) to dote, speak, and do that which
becomes them not, their persons, callings, wisdoms. One by reason of those
ascending vapours and gripings, rumbling beneath, will not be persuaded but
that he hath a serpent in his guts, a viper, another frogs. Trallianus
relates a story of a woman, that imagined she had swallowed an eel, or a
serpent, and Felix Platerus, <span class="cite">observat. lib. 1.</span> hath a most memorable
example of a countryman of his, that by chance, falling into a pit where
frogs and frogs' spawn was, and a little of that water swallowed, began to
suspect that he had likewise swallowed frogs' spawn, and with that conceit
and fear, his phantasy wrought so far, that he verily thought he had young
live frogs in his belly, <span lang="la">qui vivebant ex alimento suo</span>, that lived by his
nourishment, and was so certainly persuaded of it, that for many years
afterwards he could not be rectified in his conceit: He studied physic
seven years together to cure himself, travelled into Italy, France and
Germany to confer with the best physicians about it, and A.D. 1609, asked
his counsel amongst the rest; he told him it was wind, his conceit, &amp;c.,
but <span lang="la">mordicus contradicere, et ore, et scriptis probare nitebatur</span>: no
saying would serve, it was no wind, but real frogs: <q>and do you not hear
them croak?</q> Platerus would have deceived him, by putting live frog's into
his excrements; but he, being a physician himself, would not be deceived,
<span lang="la">vir prudens alias, et doctus</span> a wise and learned man otherwise, a doctor
of physic, and after seven years' dotage in this kind, <span lang="la">a phantasia
liberatus est</span>, he was cured. Laurentius and Goulart have many such
examples, if you be desirous to read them. One commodity above the rest
which are melancholy, these windy flatuous have, <span lang="la">lucidia intervalla</span>,
their symptoms and pains are not usually so continuate as the rest, but
come by fits, fear and sorrow, and the rest: yet in another they exceed all
others; and that is, <a href="#note2642">[2642]</a>they are luxurious, incontinent, and prone to
venery, by reason of wind, <span lang="la">et facile amant, et quamlibet fere amant</span>.
(Jason Pratensis) <a href="#note2643">[2643]</a>Rhasis is of opinion, that Venus doth many of them
much good; the other symptoms of the mind be common with the rest.

<h4><a name="1.3.2.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Symptoms of Melancholy abounding in the whole body</i>.</h4>

<p>Their bodies that are affected with this universal melancholy are most part
black, <a href="#note2644">[2644]</a><q>the melancholy juice is redundant all over,</q> hirsute they
are, and lean, they have broad veins, their blood is gross and thick <a href="#note2645">[2645]</a>
<q>Their spleen is weak,</q> and a liver apt to engender the humour; they have
kept bad diet, or have had some evacuation stopped, as haemorrhoids, or
months in women, which <a href="#note2646">[2646]</a>Trallianus, in the cure, would have carefully
to be inquired, and withal to observe of what complexion the party is of,
black or red. For as Forrestus and Hollerius contend, if <a href="#note2647">[2647]</a>they be
black, it proceeds from abundance of natural melancholy; if it proceed from
cares, agony, discontents, diet, exercise, &amp;c., they may be as well of any
other colour: red, yellow, pale, as black, and yet their whole blood
corrupt: <span lang="la">praerubri colore saepe sunt tales, saepe flavi</span>, (saith <a href="#note2648">[2648]</a>
Montaltus <span class="cite">cap. 22.</span>) The best way to discern this species, is to let them
bleed, if the blood be corrupt, thick and black, and they withal free from
those hypochondriacal symptoms, and not so grievously troubled with them,
or those of the head, it argues they are melancholy, <span lang="la">a toto corpore</span>. The
fumes which arise from this corrupt blood, disturb the mind, and make them
fearful and sorrowful, heavy hearted, as the rest, dejected, discontented,
solitary, silent, weary of their lives, dull and heavy, or merry, &amp;c., and
if far gone, that which Apuleius wished to his enemy, by way of
imprecation, is true in them; <a href="#note2649">[2649]</a><q>Dead men's bones, hobgoblins, ghosts
are ever in their minds, and meet them still in every turn: all the
bugbears of the night, and terrors, fairy-babes of tombs, and graves are
before their eyes, and in their thoughts, as to women and children, if they
be in the dark alone.</q> If they hear, or read, or see any tragical object,
it sticks by them, they are afraid of death, and yet weary of their lives,
in their discontented humours they quarrel with all the world, bitterly
inveigh, tax satirically, and because they cannot otherwise vent their
passions or redress what is amiss, as they mean, they will by violent death
at last be revenged on themselves.

<h4><a name="1.3.2.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Symptoms of Maids, Nuns, and Widows' Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>Because Lodovicus Mercatus in his second book <span class="cite">de mulier. affect. cap. 4.</span>
and Rodericus a Castro <span class="cite">de morb. mulier. cap. 3. lib. 2.</span> two famous
physicians in Spain, Daniel Sennertus of Wittenberg <span class="cite">lib. 1. part 2. cap.
13.</span> with others, have vouchsafed in their works not long since published,
to write two just treatises <span class="cite">de Melancholia virginum, Monialium et
Viduarum</span>, as a particular species of melancholy (which I have already
specified) distinct from the rest; <a href="#note2650">[2650]</a>(for it much differs from that
which commonly befalls men and other women, as having one only cause proper
to women alone) I may not omit in this general survey of melancholy
symptoms, to set down the particular signs of such parties so misaffected.

<p>The causes are assigned out of Hippocrates, Cleopatra, Moschion, and those
old <span lang="la">Gynaeciorum Scriptores</span>, of this feral malady, in more ancient maids,
widows, and barren women, <span lang="la">ob septum transversum violatum</span>, saith Mercatus,
by reason of the midriff or <span lang="la">Diaphragma</span>, heart and brain offended with
those vicious vapours which come from menstruous blood, <span lang="la">inflammationem
arteriae circa dorsum</span>, Rodericus adds, an inflammation of the back, which
with the rest is offended by <a href="#note2651">[2651]</a>that fuliginous exhalation of corrupt
seed, troubling the brain, heart and mind; the brain, I say, not in
essence, but by consent, <span lang="la">Universa enim hujus affectus causa ab utero
pendet, et a sanguinis menstrui malitia</span>, for in a word, the whole malady
proceeds from that inflammation, putridity, black smoky vapours, &amp;c., from
thence comes care, sorrow, and anxiety, obfuscation of spirits, agony,
desperation, and the like, which are intended or remitted; <span lang="la">si amatorius
accesserit ardor</span>, or any other violent object or perturbation of mind. This
melancholy may happen to widows, with much care and sorrow, as frequently
it doth, by reason of a sudden alteration of their accustomed course of
life, &amp;c. To such as lie in childbed <span lang="la">ob suppressam purgationem</span>; but to
nuns and more ancient maids, and some barren women for the causes
abovesaid, 'tis more familiar, <span lang="la">crebrius his quam reliquis accidit, inquit
Rodericus</span>, the rest are not altogether excluded.

<p>Out of these causes Rodericus defines it with Areteus, to be <span lang="la">angorem
animi</span>, a vexation of the mind, a sudden sorrow from a small, light, or no
occasion, <a href="#note2652">[2652]</a>with a kind of still dotage and grief of some part or
other, head, heart, breasts, sides, back, belly, &amp;c., with much
solitariness, weeping, distraction, &amp;c., from which they are sometimes
suddenly delivered, because it comes and goes by fits, and is not so
permanent as other melancholy.

<p>But to leave this brief description, the most ordinary symptoms be these,
<span lang="la">pulsatio juxta dorsum</span>, a beating about the back, which is almost
perpetual, the skin is many times rough, squalid, especially, as Areteus
observes, about the arms, knees, and knuckles. The midriff and
heart-strings do burn and beat very fearfully, and when this vapour or fume
is stirred, flieth upward, the heart itself beats, is sore grieved, and
faints, <span lang="la">fauces siccitate praecluduntur, ut difficulter possit ab uteri
strangulatione decerni</span>, like fits of the mother, <span lang="la">Alvus plerisque nil
reddit, aliis exiguum, acre, biliosum, lotium flavum</span>. They complain many
times, saith Mercatus, of a great pain in their heads, about their hearts,
and hypochondries, and so likewise in their breasts, which are often sore,
sometimes ready to swoon, their faces are inflamed, and red, they are dry,
thirsty, suddenly hot, much troubled with wind, cannot sleep, &amp;c. And from
hence proceed <span lang="la">ferina deliramenta</span>, a brutish kind of dotage, troublesome
sleep, terrible dreams in the night, <span lang="la">subrusticus pudor et verecundia
ignava</span>, a foolish kind of bashfulness to some, perverse conceits and
opinions, <a href="#note2653">[2653]</a>dejection of mind, much discontent, preposterous judgment.
They are apt to loath, dislike, disdain, to be weary of every object, &amp;c.,
each thing almost is tedious to them, they pine away, void of counsel, apt
to weep, and tremble, timorous, fearful, sad, and out of all hope of better
fortunes. They take delight in nothing for the time, but love to be alone
and solitary, though that do them more harm: and thus they are affected so
long as this vapour lasteth; but by-and-by, as pleasant and merry as ever
they were in their lives, they sing, discourse, and laugh in any good
company, upon all occasions, and so by fits it takes them now and then,
except the malady be inveterate, and then 'tis more frequent, vehement, and
continuate. Many of them cannot tell how to express themselves in words, or
how it holds them, what ails them, you cannot understand them, or well tell
what to make of their sayings; so far gone sometimes, so stupefied and
distracted, they think themselves bewitched, they are in despair, <span lang="la">aptae ad
fletum, desperationem, dolores mammis et hypocondriis</span>. Mercatus therefore
adds, now their breasts, now their hypochondries, belly and sides, then
their heart and head aches, now heat, then wind, now this, now that
offends, they are weary of all; <a href="#note2654">[2654]</a>and yet will not, cannot again tell
how, where or what offends them, though they be in great pain, agony, and
frequently complain, grieving, sighing, weeping, and discontented still,
<span lang="la">sine causa manifesta</span>, most part, yet I say they will complain, grudge,
lament, and not be persuaded, but that they are troubled with an evil
spirit, which is frequent in Germany, saith Rodericus, amongst the common
sort: and to such as are most grievously affected, (for he makes three
degrees of this disease in women,) they are in despair, surely forespoken
or bewitched, and in extremity of their dotage, (weary of their lives,)
some of them will attempt to make away themselves. Some think they see
visions, confer with spirits and devils, they shall surely be damned, are
afraid of some treachery, imminent danger, and the like, they will not
speak, make answer to any question, but are almost distracted, mad, or
stupid for the time, and by fits: and thus it holds them, as they are more
or less affected, and as the inner humour is intended or remitted, or by
outward objects and perturbations aggravated, solitariness, idleness, &amp;c.

<p>Many other maladies there are incident to young women, out of that one and
only cause above specified, many feral diseases. I will not so much as
mention their names, melancholy alone is the subject of my present
discourse, from which I will not swerve. The several cures of this
infirmity, concerning diet, which must be very sparing, phlebotomy, physic,
internal, external remedies, are at large in great variety in <a href="#note2655">[2655]</a>
Rodericus a Castro, Sennertus, and Mercatus, which whoso will, as occasion
serves, may make use of. But the best and surest remedy of all, is to see
them well placed, and married to good husbands in due time, <span lang="la">hinc illae,
lachrymae</span>, that is the primary cause, and this the ready cure, to give them
content to their desires. I write not this to patronise any wanton, idle
flirt, lascivious or light housewives, which are too forward many times,
unruly, and apt to cast away themselves on him that comes next, without all
care, counsel, circumspection, and judgment. If religion, good discipline,
honest education, wholesome exhortation, fair promises, fame and loss of
good name cannot inhibit and deter such, (which to chaste and sober maids
cannot choose but avail much,) labour and exercise, strict diet, rigour and
threats may more opportunely be used, and are able of themselves to qualify
and divert an ill-disposed temperament. For seldom should you see an hired
servant, a poor handmaid, though ancient, that is kept hard to her work,
and bodily labour, a coarse country wench troubled in this kind, but noble
virgins, nice gentlewomen, such as are solitary and idle, live at ease,
lead a life out of action and employment, that fare well, in great houses
and jovial companies, ill-disposed peradventure of themselves, and not
willing to make any resistance, discontented otherwise, of weak judgment,
able bodies, and subject to passions, (<span lang="la">grandiores virgines</span>, saith
Mercatus, <span lang="la">steriles et viduae plerumque melancholicae</span>,) such for the most
part are misaffected, and prone to this disease. I do not so much pity them
that may otherwise be eased, but those alone that out of a strong
temperament, innate constitution, are violently carried away with this
torrent of inward humours, and though very modest of themselves, sober,
religious, virtuous, and well given, (as many so distressed maids are,) yet
cannot make resistance, these grievances will appear, this malady will take
place, and now manifestly show itself, and may not otherwise be helped. But
where am I? Into what subject have I rushed? What have I to do with nuns,
maids, virgins, widows? I am a bachelor myself, and lead a monastic life in
a college, <span lang="la">nae ego sane ineptus qui haec dixerim</span>,) I confess 'tis an
indecorum, and as Pallas a virgin blushed, when Jupiter by chance spake
of love matters in her presence, and turned away her face; <span lang="la">me reprimam</span>
though my subject necessarily require it, I will say no more.

<p>And yet I must and will say something more, add a word or two <span lang="la">in gratiam
virginum et viduarum</span>, in favour of all such distressed parties, in
commiseration of their present estate. And as I cannot choose but condole
their mishap that labour of this infirmity, and are destitute of help in
this case, so must I needs inveigh against them that are in fault, more
than manifest causes, and as bitterly tax those tyrannising
pseudopoliticians, superstitious orders, rash vows, hard-hearted parents,
guardians, unnatural friends, allies, (call them how you will,) those
careless and stupid overseers, that out of worldly respects, covetousness,
supine negligence, their own private ends (<span lang="la">cum sibi sit interim bene</span>) can
so severely reject, stubbornly neglect, and impiously contemn, without all
remorse and pity, the tears, sighs, groans, and grievous miseries of such
poor souls committed to their charge. How odious and abominable are those
superstitious and rash vows of Popish monasteries, so to bind and enforce
men and women to vow virginity, to lead a single life, against the laws of
nature, opposite to religion, policy, and humanity, so to starve, to offer
violence, to suppress the vigour of youth, by rigorous statutes, severe
laws, vain persuasions, to debar them of that to which by their innate
temperature they are so furiously inclined, urgently carried, and sometimes
precipitated, even irresistibly led, to the prejudice of their soul's
health, and good estate of body and mind: and all for base and private
respects, to maintain their gross superstition, to enrich themselves and
their territories as they falsely suppose, by hindering some marriages,
that the world be not full of beggars, and their parishes pestered with
orphans; stupid politicians; <span lang="la">haeccine fieri flagilia</span>? ought these things
so to be carried? better marry than burn, saith the Apostle, but they are
otherwise persuaded. They will by all means quench their neighbour's house
if it be on fire, but that fire of lust which breaks out into such
lamentable flames, they will not take notice of, their own bowels
oftentimes, flesh and blood shall so rage and burn, and they will not see
it: <span lang="la">miserum est</span>, saith Austin, <span lang="la">seipsum non miserescere</span>, and they are
miserable in the meantime that cannot pity themselves, the common good of
all, and <span lang="la">per consequens</span> their own estates. For let them but consider what
fearful maladies, feral diseases, gross inconveniences, come to both sexes
by this enforced temperance, it troubles me to think of, much more to
relate those frequent abortions and murdering of infants in their nunneries
(read <a href="#note2656">[2656]</a>Kemnitius and others), and notorious fornications, those
Spintrias, Tribadas, Ambubeias, &amp;c., those rapes, incests, adulteries,
mastuprations, sodomies, buggeries of monks and friars. See Bale's
visitation of abbeys, <a href="#note2657">[2657]</a>Mercurialis, Rodericus a Castro, Peter
Forestus, and divers physicians; I know their ordinary apologies and
excuses for these things, <span lang="la">sed viderint Politici, Medici, Theologi</span>, I
shall more opportunely meet with them <a href="#note2658">[2658]</a>elsewhere.

<h4><i>Immediate cause of these precedent Symptoms</i>.</h4>

<p>To give some satisfaction to melancholy men that are troubled with these
symptoms, a better means in my judgment cannot be taken, than to show them
the causes whence they proceed; not from devils as they suppose, or that
they are bewitched or forsaken of God, hear or see, &amp;c. as many of them
think, but from natural and inward causes, that so knowing them, they may
better avoid the effects, or at least endure them with more patience. The
most grievous and common symptoms are fear and sorrow, and that without a
cause to the wisest and discreetest men, in this malady not to be avoided.
The reason why they are so, Aetius discusseth at large, <span class="cite">Tetrabib. 2. 2.</span> in
his first problem out of Galen, <span class="cite">lib. 2. de causis sympt. 1.</span> For Galen
imputeth all to the cold that is black, and thinks that the spirits being
darkened, and the substance of the brain cloudy and dark, all the objects
thereof appear terrible, and the <a href="#note2660">[2660]</a>mind itself, by those dark,
obscure, gross fumes, ascending from black humours, is in continual
darkness, fear, and sorrow; divers terrible monstrous fictions in a
thousand shapes and apparitions occur, with violent passions, by which the
brain and fantasy are troubled and eclipsed. <a href="#note2661">[2661]</a>Fracastorius, <span class="cite">lib. 2.
de intellect</span>, <q>will have cold to be the cause of fear and sorrow; for
such as are cold are ill-disposed to mirth, dull, and heavy, by nature
solitary, silent; and not for any inward darkness (as physicians think) for
many melancholy men dare boldly be, continue, and walk in the dark, and
delight in it:</q> <span lang="la">solum frigidi timidi</span>: if they be hot, they are merry; and
the more hot, the more furious, and void of fear, as we see in madmen; but
this reason holds not, for then no melancholy, proceeding from choler
adust, should fear. <a href="#note2662">[2662]</a>Averroes scoffs at Galen for his reasons, and
brings five arguments to repel them: so doth Herc. de Saxonia, <span class="cite">Tract. de
Melanch. cap. 3.</span> assigning other causes, which are copiously censured
and confuted by Aelianus Montaltus, <span class="cite">cap. 5 and 6.</span> Lod. Mercatus <span class="cite">de
Inter. morb. cur. lib. 1. cap. 17.</span> Altomarus, <span class="cite">cap. 7. de mel.</span>
Guianerius, <span class="cite">tract. 15. c. 1.</span> Bright <span class="cite">cap. 37.</span> Laurentius, <span class="cite">cap. 5.</span>
Valesius, <span class="cite">med. cont. lib. 5, con. 1.</span> <a href="#note2663">[2663]</a><q>Distemperature,</q> they
conclude, <q>makes black juice, blackness obscures the spirits, the spirits
obscured, cause fear and sorrow.</q> Laurentius, <span class="cite">cap. 13.</span> supposeth these
black fumes offend specially the diaphragma or midriff, and so <span lang="la">per
consequens</span> the mind, which is obscured as <a href="#note2664">[2664]</a>the sun by a cloud. To
this opinion of Galen, almost all the Greeks and Arabians subscribe, the
Latins new and old, <span lang="la">internae, tenebrae offuscant animum, ut externae
nocent pueris</span>, as children are affrighted in the dark, so are melancholy
men at all times, <a href="#note2665">[2665]</a>as having the inward cause with them, and still
carrying it about. Which black vapours, whether they proceed from the black
blood about the heart, as T. W. Jes. thinks in his treatise of the passions
of the mind, or stomach, spleen, midriff, or all the misaffected parts
together, it boots not, they keep the mind in a perpetual dungeon, and
oppress it with continual fears, anxieties, sorrows, &amp;c. It is an ordinary
thing for such as are sound to laugh at this dejected pusillanimity, and
those other symptoms of melancholy, to make themselves merry with them, and
to wonder at such, as toys and trifles, which may be resisted and
withstood, if they will themselves: but let him that so wonders, consider
with himself, that if a man should tell him on a sudden, some of his
especial friends were dead, could he choose but grieve? Or set him upon a
steep rock, where he should be in danger to be precipitated, could he be
secure? His heart would tremble for fear, and his head be giddy. P. Byaras,
<span class="cite">Tract. de pest.</span> gives instance (as I have said) <a href="#note2666">[2666]</a><q>and put case</q>
(saith he) <q>in one that walks upon a plank, if it lie on the ground, he can
safely do it: but if the same plank be laid over some deep water, instead
of a bridge, he is vehemently moved, and 'tis nothing but his imagination,
<span lang="la">forma cadendi impressa</span>, to which his other members and faculties obey.</q>
Yea, but you infer, that such men have a just cause to fear, a true object
of fear; so have melancholy men an inward cause, a perpetual fume and
darkness, causing fear, grief, suspicion, which they carry with them, an
object which cannot be removed; but sticks as close, and is as inseparable
as a shadow to a body, and who can expel or overrun his shadow? Remove heat
of the liver, a cold stomach, weak spleen: remove those adust humours and
vapours arising from them, black blood from the heart, all outward
perturbations, take away the cause, and then bid them not grieve nor fear,
or be heavy, dull, lumpish, otherwise counsel can do little good; you may
as well bid him that is sick of an ague not to be a dry; or him that is
wounded not to feel pain.

<p>Suspicion follows fear and sorrow at heels, arising out of the same
fountain, so thinks <a href="#note2667">[2667]</a>Fracastorius, <q>that fear is the cause of
suspicion, and still they suspect some treachery, or some secret
machination to be framed against them, still they distrust.</q> Restlessness
proceeds from the same spring, variety of fumes make them like and dislike.
Solitariness, avoiding of light, that they are weary of their lives, hate
the world, arise from the same causes, for their spirits and humours are
opposite to light, fear makes them avoid company, and absent themselves,
lest they should be misused, hissed at, or overshoot themselves, which
still they suspect. They are prone to venery by reason of wind. Angry,
waspish, and fretting still, out of abundance of choler, which causeth
fearful dreams and violent perturbations to them, both sleeping and waking:
That they suppose they have no heads, fly, sink, they are pots, glasses,
&amp;c. is wind in their heads. <a href="#note2668">[2668]</a>Herc. de Saxonia doth ascribe this to
the several motions in the animal spirits, <q>their dilation, contraction,
confusion, alteration, tenebrosity, hot or cold distemperature,</q> excluding
all material humours. <a href="#note2669">[2669]</a>Fracastorius <q>accounts it a thing worthy of
inquisition, why they should entertain such false conceits, as that they
have horns, great noses, that they are birds, beasts,</q> &amp;c., why they should
think themselves kings, lords, cardinals. For the first, <a href="#note2670">[2670]</a>
Fracastorius gives two reasons: <q>One is the disposition of the body; the
other, the occasion of the fantasy,</q> as if their eyes be purblind, their
ears sing, by reason of some cold and rheum, &amp;c. To the second, Laurentius
answers, the imagination inwardly or outwardly moved, represents to the
understanding, not enticements only, to favour the passion or dislike, but
a very intensive pleasure follows the passion or displeasure, and the will
and reason are captivated by delighting in it.

<p>Why students and lovers are so often melancholy and mad, the philosopher of
<a href="#note2671">[2671]</a>Conimbra assigns this reason, <q>because by a vehement and continual
meditation of that wherewith they are affected, they fetch up the spirits
into the brain, and with the heat brought with them, they incend it beyond
measure: and the cells of the inner senses dissolve their temperature,
which being dissolved, they cannot perform their offices as they ought.</q>

<p>Why melancholy men are witty, which Aristotle hath long since maintained in
his problems; and that <a href="#note2672">[2672]</a>all learned men, famous philosophers, and
lawgivers, <span lang="la">ad unum fere omnes melancholici</span>, have still been melancholy,
is a problem much controverted. Jason Pratensis will have it understood of
natural melancholy, which opinion Melancthon inclines to, in his book <span class="cite">de
Anima</span>, and Marcilius Ficinus <span class="cite">de san. tuend. lib. 1. cap. 5.</span> but not
simple, for that makes men stupid, heavy, dull, being cold and dry,
fearful, fools, and solitary, but mixed with the other humours, phlegm only
excepted; and they not adust, <a href="#note2673">[2673]</a>but so mixed as that blood he half,
with little or no adustion, that they be neither too hot nor too cold.
Aponensis, cited by Melancthon, thinks it proceeds from melancholy adust,
excluding all natural melancholy as too cold. Laurentius condemns his
tenet, because adustion of humours makes men mad, as lime burns when water
is cast on it. It must be mixed with blood, and somewhat adust, and so that
old aphorism of Aristotle may be verified, <span lang="la">Nullum magnum ingenium sine
mixtura dementiae</span>, no excellent wit without a mixture of madness.
Fracastorius shall decide the controversy, <a href="#note2674">[2674]</a><q>phlegmatic are dull:
sanguine lively, pleasant, acceptable, and merry, but not witty; choleric
are too swift in motion, and furious, impatient of contemplation, deceitful
wits: melancholy men have the most excellent wits, but not all; this humour
may be hot or cold, thick, or thin; if too hot, they are furious and mad:
if too cold, dull, stupid, timorous, and sad: if temperate, excellent,
rather inclining to that extreme of heat, than cold.</q> This sentence of his
will agree with that of Heraclitus, a dry light makes a wise mind,
temperate heat and dryness are the chief causes of a good wit; therefore,
saith Aelian, an elephant is the wisest of all brute beasts, because his
brain is driest, <span lang="la">et ob atrae, bilis capiam</span>: this reason Cardan approves,
<span class="cite">subtil. l. 12.</span> Jo. Baptista Silvaticus, a physician of Milan, in his
first controversy, hath copiously handled this question: Rulandus in his
problems, Caelius Rhodiginus, <span class="cite">lib. 17.</span> Valleriola <span class="cite">6to. narrat. med.</span>
Herc. de Saxonia, <span class="cite">Tract. posth. de mel. cap. 3.</span> Lodovicus Mercatus, <span class="cite">de
inter. morb. cur. lib. cap. 17.</span> Baptista Porta, <span class="cite">Physiog. lib. 1. c.
13.</span> and many others.

<p>Weeping, sighing, laughing, itching, trembling, sweating, blushing, hearing
and seeing strange noises, visions, wind, crudity, are motions of the body,
depending upon these precedent motions of the mind: neither are tears,
affections, but actions (as Scaliger holds) <a href="#note2675">[2675]</a><q>the voice of such as
are afraid, trembles, because the heart is shaken</q> (<span class="cite">Conimb. prob. 6.
sec. 3. de som.</span>) why they stutter or falter in their speech,
Mercurialis and Montaltus, <span class="cite">cap. 17.</span> give like reasons out of Hippocrates,
<a href="#note2676">[2676]</a><q>dryness, which makes the nerves of the tongue torpid.</q> Fast
speaking (which is a symptom of some few) Aetius will have caused <a href="#note2677">[2677]</a>
<q>from abundance of wind, and swiftness of imagination:</q> <a href="#note2678">[2678]</a><q>baldness
comes from excess of dryness,</q> hirsuteness from a dry temperature. The
cause of much waking in a dry brain, continual meditation, discontent,
fears and cares, that suffer not the mind to be at rest, incontinency is
from wind, and a hot liver, Montanus, <span class="cite">cons. 26.</span> Rumbling in the guts is
caused from wind, and wind from ill concoction, weakness of natural heat,
or a distempered heat and cold; <a href="#note2679">[2679]</a>Palpitation of the heart from
vapours, heaviness and aching from the same cause. That the belly is hard,
wind is a cause, and of that leaping in many parts. Redness of the face,
and itching, as if they were flea-bitten, or stung with pismires, from a
sharp subtle wind. <a href="#note2680">[2680]</a>Cold sweat from vapours arising from the
hypochondries, which pitch upon the skin; leanness for want of good
nourishment. Why their appetite is so great, <a href="#note2681">[2681]</a>Aetius answers: <span lang="la">Os
ventris frigescit</span>, cold in those inner parts, cold belly, and hot liver,
causeth crudity, and intention proceeds from perturbations, <a href="#note2682">[2682]</a>our
souls for want of spirits cannot attend exactly to so many intentive
operations, being exhaust, and overswayed by passion, she cannot consider
the reasons which may dissuade her from such affections.

<p><a href="#note2683">[2683]</a>Bashfulness and blushing, is a passion proper to men alone, and is
not only caused for <a href="#note2684">[2684]</a>some shame and ignominy, or that they are guilty
unto themselves of some foul fact committed, but as <a href="#note2685">[2685]</a>Fracastorius
well determines, <span lang="la">ob defectum proprium, et timorem</span>, <q>from fear, and a
conceit of our defects; the face labours and is troubled at his presence
that sees our defects, and nature willing to help, sends thither heat, heat
draws the subtlest blood, and so we blush. They that are bold, arrogant,
and careless, seldom or never blush, but such as are fearful.</q> Anthonius
Lodovicus, in his book <span class="cite">de pudore</span>, will have this subtle blood to arise
in the face, not so much for the reverence of our betters in presence,
<a href="#note2686">[2686]</a><q>but for joy and pleasure, or if anything at unawares shall pass
from us, a sudden accident, occurse, or meeting:</q> (which Disarius in <a href="#note2687">[2687]</a>
Macrobius confirms) any object heard or seen, for blind men never blush, as
Dandinus observes, the night and darkness make men impudent. Or that we be
staid before our betters, or in company we like not, or if anything molest
and offend us, <span lang="la">erubescentia</span> turns to <span lang="la">rubor</span>, blushing to a continuate
redness. <a href="#note2688">[2688]</a>Sometimes the extremity of the ears tingle, and are red,
sometimes the whole face, <span lang="la">Etsi nihil vitiosum commiseris</span>, as Lodovicus
holds: though Aristotle is of opinion, <span lang="la">omnis pudor ex vitio commisso</span>, all
shame for some offence. But we find otherwise, it may as well proceed
<a href="#note2689">[2689]</a>from fear, from force and inexperience, (so <a href="#note2690">[2690]</a>Dandinus holds)
as vice; a hot liver, saith Duretus (<span lang="la">notis in Hollerium</span>:) <q>from a hot
brain, from wind, the lungs heated, or after drinking of wine, strong
drink, perturbations,</q> &amp;c.

<p>Laughter what it is, saith <a href="#note2691">[2691]</a>Tully, <q>how caused, where, and so
suddenly breaks out, that desirous to stay it, we cannot, how it comes to
possess and stir our face, veins, eyes, countenance, mouth, sides, let
Democritus determine.</q> The cause that it often affects melancholy men so
much, is given by Gomesius, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de sale genial. cap. 18.</span>
abundance of pleasant vapours, which, in sanguine melancholy especially,
break from the heart, <a href="#note2692">[2692]</a><q>and tickle the midriff, because it is
transverse and full of nerves: by which titillation the sense being moved,
and arteries distended, or pulled, the spirits from thence move and possess
the sides, veins, countenance, eyes.</q> See more in Jossius <span class="cite">de risu et fletu</span>,
Vives <span class="cite">3 de Anima</span>. Tears, as Scaliger defines, proceed from grief and
pity, <a href="#note2693">[2693]</a><q>or from the heating of a moist brain, for a dry cannot weep.</q>

<p>That they see and hear so many phantasms, chimeras, noises, visions, &amp;c. as
Fienus hath discoursed at large in his book of imagination, and <a href="#note2694">[2694]</a>
Lavater <span class="cite">de spectris, part. 1. cap. 2. 3. 4.</span> their corrupt phantasy
makes them see and hear that which indeed is neither heard nor seen, <span lang="la">Qui
multum jejunant, aut noctes ducunt insomnes</span>, they that much fast, or want
sleep, as melancholy or sick men commonly do, see visions, or such as are
weak-sighted, very timorous by nature, mad, distracted, or earnestly seek.
<span lang="la">Sabini quod volunt somniant</span>, as the saying is, they dream of that they
desire. Like Sarmiento the Spaniard, who when he was sent to discover the
straits of Magellan, and confine places, by the Prorex of Peru, standing on
the top of a hill, <span lang="la">Amaenissimam planitiem despicere sibi visus fuit,
aedificia magnifica, quamplurimos Pagos, alias Turres, splendida Templa</span>,
and brave cities, built like ours in Europe, not, saith mine <a href="#note2695">[2695]</a>author,
that there was any such thing, but that he was <span lang="la">vanissimus et nimis
credulus</span>, and would fain have had it so. Or as <a href="#note2696">[2696]</a>Lod. Mercatus
proves, by reason of inward vapours, and humours from blood, choler, &amp;c.
diversely mixed, they apprehend and see outwardly, as they suppose, divers
images, which indeed are not. As they that drink wine think all runs round,
when it is in their own brain; so is it with these men, the fault and cause
is inward, as Galen affirms, <a href="#note2697">[2697]</a>mad men and such as are near death,
<span lang="la">quas extra se videre putant Imagines, intra oculos habent</span>, 'tis in their
brain, which seems to be before them; the brain as a concave glass reflects
solid bodies. <span lang="la">Senes etiam decrepiti cerebrum habent concavum et aridum, ut
imaginentur se videre</span> (saith <a href="#note2698">[2698]</a>Boissardus) <span lang="la">quae non sunt</span>, old men
are too frequently mistaken and dote in like case: or as he that looketh
through a piece of red glass, judgeth everything he sees to be red; corrupt
vapours mounting from the body to the head, and distilling again from
thence to the eyes, when they have mingled themselves with the watery
crystal which receiveth the shadows of things to be seen, make all things
appear of the same colour, which remains in the humour that overspreads our
sight, as to melancholy men all is black, to phlegmatic all white, &amp;c. Or
else as before the organs corrupt by a corrupt phantasy, as Lemnius, <span class="cite">lib.
1. cap. 16.</span> well quotes, <a href="#note2699">[2699]</a><q>cause a great agitation of spirits, and
humours, which wander to and fro in all the creeks of the brain, and cause
such apparitions before their eyes.</q> One thinks he reads something written
in the moon, as Pythagoras is said to have done of old, another smells
brimstone, hears Cerberus bark: Orestes now mad supposed he saw the furies
tormenting him, and his mother still ready to run upon him,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note2700">[2700]</a>O mater obsecro noli me persequi</div>
<div class="line">His furiis, aspectu anguineis, horribilibus,</div>
<div class="line">Ecce ecce me invadunt, in me jam ruunt;</div>
</div>
but Electra told him thus raving in his mad fit, he saw no such sights at
all, it was but his crazed imagination.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

<div class="line">Non cernis etenim quae videre te putas.</div>
</div>
<p>So Pentheus (in Bacchis Euripidis) saw two suns, two Thebes, his brain
alone was troubled. Sickness is an ordinary cause of such sights. Cardan,
<span class="cite">subtil. 8.</span> <span lang="la">Mens aegra laboribus et jejuniis fracta, facit eos videre,
audire</span>, &amp;c. And, Osiander beheld strange visions, and Alexander ab
Alexandro both, in their sickness, which he relates <span class="cite">de rerum varietat.
lib. 8. cap. 44.</span> Albategnius that noble Arabian, on his death-bed, saw a
ship ascending and descending, which Fracastorius records of his friend
Baptista Tirrianus. Weak sight and a vain persuasion withal, may effect as
much, and second causes concurring, as an oar in water makes a refraction,
and seems bigger, bended double, &amp;c. The thickness of the air may cause
such effects, or any object not well-discerned in the dark, fear and
phantasy will suspect to be a ghost, a devil, &amp;c. <a href="#note2702">[2702]</a><span lang="la">Quod nimis miseri
timent, hoc facile credunt</span>, we are apt to believe, and mistake in such
cases. Marcellus Donatus, <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 1.</span> brings in a story out of
Aristotle, of one Antepharon which likely saw, wheresoever he was, his own
image in the air, as in a glass. Vitellio, <span class="cite">lib. 10. perspect.</span> hath such
another instance of a familiar acquaintance of his, that after the want of
three or four nights sleep, as he was riding by a river side, saw another
riding with him, and using all such gestures as he did, but when more light
appeared, it vanished. Eremites and anchorites have frequently such absurd
visions, revelations by reason of much fasting, and bad diet, many are
deceived by legerdemain, as Scot hath well showed in his book of the
discovery of witchcraft, and Cardan, <span class="cite">subtil. 18.</span> suffites, perfumes,
suffumigations, mixed candles, perspective glasses, and such natural
causes, make men look as if they were dead, or with horse-heads,
bull's-horns, and such like brutish shapes, the room full of snakes,
adders, dark, light, green, red, of all colours, as you may perceive in
Baptista Porta, Alexis, Albertus, and others, glow-worms, fire-drakes,
meteors, <span lang="la">Ignis fatuus</span>, which Plinius, <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 37.</span> calls Castor
and Pollux, with many such that appear in moorish grounds, about
churchyards, moist valleys, or where battles have been fought, the causes
of which read in Goclenius, Velouris, Fickius, &amp;c. such fears are often
done, to frighten children with squibs, rotten wood, &amp;c. to make folks look
as if they were dead, <a href="#note2703">[2703]</a><span lang="la">solito majores</span>, bigger, lesser, fairer,
fouler, <span lang="la">ut astantes sine capitibus videantur; aut toti igniti, aut
forma daemonum, accipe pilos canis nigri</span>, &amp;c. saith Albertus; and so 'tis
ordinary to see strange uncouth sights by catoptrics: who knows not that if
in a dark room, the light be admitted at one only little hole, and a paper
or glass put upon it, the sun shining, will represent on the opposite wall
all such objects as are illuminated by his rays? with concave and cylinder
glasses, we may reflect any shape of men, devils, antics, (as magicians
most part do, to gull a silly spectator in a dark room), we will ourselves,
and that hanging in the air, when 'tis nothing but such an horrible image
as <a href="#note2704">[2704]</a>Agrippa demonstrates, placed in another room. Roger Bacon of old
is said to have represented his own image walking in the air by this art,
though no such thing appear in his perspectives. But most part it is in the
brain that deceives them, although I may not deny, but that oftentimes the
devil deludes them, takes his opportunity to suggest, and represent vain
objects to melancholy men, and such as are ill affected. To these you may
add the knavish impostures of jugglers, exorcists, mass-priests, and
mountebanks, of whom Roger Bacon speaks, &amp;c. <span class="cite">de miraculis naturae et
artis. cap. 1.</span> <a href="#note2705">[2705]</a>they can counterfeit the voices of all birds and
brute beasts almost, all tones and tunes of men, and speak within their
throats, as if they spoke afar off, that they make their auditors believe
they hear spirits, and are thence much astonished and affrighted with it.
Besides, those artificial devices to overhear their confessions, like that
whispering place of Gloucester <a href="#note2706">[2706]</a>with us, or like the duke's place at
Mantua in Italy, where the sound is reverberated by a concave wall; a
reason of which Blancanus in his Echometria gives, and mathematically
demonstrates.

<p>So that the hearing is as frequently deluded as the sight, from the same
causes almost, as he that hears bells, will make them sound what he list.
<q>As the fool thinketh, so the bell clinketh.</q> Theophilus in Galen thought
he heard music, from vapours which made his ears sound, &amp;c. Some are
deceived by echoes, some by roaring of waters, or concaves and
reverberation of air in the ground, hollow places and walls. <a href="#note2707">[2707]</a>At
Cadurcum, in Aquitaine, words and sentences are repeated by a strange echo
to the full, or whatsoever you shall play upon a musical instrument, more
distinctly and louder, than they are spoken at first. Some echoes repeat a
thing spoken seven times, as at Olympus, in Macedonia, as Pliny relates,
<span class="cite">lib. 36. cap. 15.</span> Some twelve times, as at Charenton, a village near
Paris, in France. At Delphos, in Greece, heretofore was a miraculous echo,
and so in many other places. Cardan, <span class="cite">subtil. l. 18</span>, hath wonderful
stories of such as have been deluded by these echoes. Blancanus the Jesuit,
in his Echometria, hath variety of examples, and gives his reader full
satisfaction of all such sounds by way of demonstration. <a href="#note2708">[2708]</a>At Barrey,
an isle in the Severn mouth, they seem to hear a smith's forge; so at
Lipari, and those sulphureous isles, and many such like, which Olaus speaks
of in the continent of Scandia, and those northern countries. Cardan <span class="cite">de
rerum var. l. 15, c. 84</span>, mentioneth a woman, that still supposed she
heard the devil call her, and speaking to her, she was a painter's wife in
Milan: and many such illusions and voices, which proceed most part from a
corrupt imagination.

<p>Whence it comes to pass, that they prophesy, speak several languages, talk
of astronomy, and other unknown sciences to them (of which they have been
ever ignorant): <a href="#note2709">[2709]</a>I have in brief touched, only this I will here add,
that Arculanus, <span class="cite">Bodin. lib. 3, cap. 6, daemon.</span> and some others, <a href="#note2710">[2710]</a>
hold as a manifest token that such persons are possessed with the devil; so
doth <a href="#note2711">[2711]</a>Hercules de Saxonia, and Apponensis, and fit only to be cured
by a priest. But <a href="#note2712">[2712]</a>Guianerius, <a href="#note2713">[2713]</a>Montaltus, Pomporiatius of
Padua, and Lemnius <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 2</span>, refer it wholly to the
ill-disposition of the <a href="#note2714">[2714]</a>humour, and that out of the authority of
Aristotle <span class="cite">prob. 30. 1</span>, because such symptoms are cured by purging; and as
by the striking of a flint fire is enforced, so by the vehement motion of
spirits, they do <span lang="la">elicere voces inauditas</span>, compel strange speeches to be
spoken: another argument he hath from Plato's <span lang="la">reminiscentia</span>, which all
out as likely as that which <a href="#note2715">[2715]</a>Marsilius Ficinus speaks of his friend
Pierleonus; by a divine kind of infusion he understood the secrets of
nature, and tenets of Grecian and barbarian philosophers, before ever he
heard of, saw, or read their works: but in this I should rather hold with
Avicenna and his associates, that such symptoms proceed from evil spirits,
which take all opportunities of humours decayed, or otherwise to pervert
the soul of man: and besides, the humour itself is <span lang="la">balneum diaboli</span>, the
devil's bath; and as Agrippa proves, doth entice him to seize upon them.

is most secure, gentle, and remiss, Hercules de Saxonia. <a href="#note2716">[2716]</a><q>If that
evacuation of haemorrhoids, or <span lang="la">varices</span>, which they call the water between
the skin, shall happen to a melancholy man, his misery is ended,</q>
Hippocrates <span class="cite">Aphor. 6, 11.</span> Galen <span class="cite">l. 6, de morbis vulgar. com. 8</span>,
confirms the same; and to this aphorism of Hippocrates, all the Arabians,
new and old Latins subscribe; Montaltus <span class="cite">c. 25</span>, Hercules de Saxonia,
Mercurialis, Vittorius Faventinus, &amp;c. Skenkius, <span class="cite">l. 1, observat. med. c.
de Mania</span>, illustrates this aphorism, with an example of one Daniel Federer
a coppersmith that was long melancholy, and in the end mad about the 27th
year of his age, these <span lang="la">varices</span> or water began to arise in his thighs, and
he was freed from his madness. Marius the Roman was so cured, some, say,
though with great pain. Skenkius hath some other instances of women that
have been helped by flowing of their mouths, which before were stopped.
That the opening of the haemorrhoids will do as much for men, all physicians
jointly signify, so they be voluntary, some say, and not by compulsion. All
melancholy are better after a quartan; <a href="#note2717">[2717]</a>Jobertus saith, scarce any
man hath that ague twice; but whether it free him from this malady, 'tis a
question; for many physicians ascribe all long agues for especial causes,
and a quartan ague amongst the rest. <a href="#note2718">[2718]</a>Rhasis <span class="cite">cont. lib. 1, tract.
9.</span> <q>When melancholy gets out at the superficies of the skin, or settles
breaking out in scabs, leprosy, morphew, or is purged by stools, or by the
urine, or that the spleen is enlarged, and those <span lang="la">varices</span> appear, the
disease is dissolved.</q> Guianerius, <span class="cite">cap. 5, tract. 15</span>, adds dropsy,
jaundice, dysentery, leprosy, as good signs, to these scabs, morphews, and
breaking out, and proves it out of the 6th of Hippocrates' Aphorisms.

<p>Evil prognostics on the other part. <span lang="la">Inveterata melancholia incurabilis</span>,
if it be inveterate, it is <a href="#note2719">[2719]</a>incurable, a common axiom, <span lang="la">aut
difficulter curabilis</span> as they say that make the best, hardly cured. This
Galen witnesseth, <span class="cite">l. 3, de loc. affect. cap. 6</span>, <a href="#note2720">[2720]</a><q>be it in whom
it will, or from what cause soever, it is ever long, wayward, tedious, and
hard to be cured, if once it be habituated.</q> As Lucian said of the gout, she
was <a href="#note2721">[2721]</a><q>the queen of diseases, and inexorable,</q> may we say of
melancholy. Yet Paracelsus will have all diseases whatsoever curable, and
laughs at them which think otherwise, as T. Erastus <span class="cite">par. 3</span>, objects to
him; although in another place, hereditary diseases he accounts incurable,
and by no art to be removed. <a href="#note2722">[2722]</a>Hildesheim <span class="cite">spicel. 2, de mel.</span> holds
it less dangerous if only <a href="#note2723">[2723]</a><q>imagination be hurt, and not reason,</q>
<a href="#note2724">[2724]</a><q>the gentlest is from blood. Worse from choler adust, but the worst
of all from melancholy putrefied.</q> <a href="#note2725">[2725]</a>Bruel esteems hypochondriacal
least dangerous, and the other two species (opposite to Galen) hardest to
be cured. <a href="#note2726">[2726]</a>The cure is hard in man, but much more difficult in women.
And both men and women must take notice of that saying of Montanus
<span class="cite">consil. 230, pro Abate Italo</span>, <a href="#note2727">[2727]</a><q>This malady doth commonly
accompany them to their grave; physicians may ease, and it may lie hid for
a time, but they cannot quite cure it, but it will return again more
violent and sharp than at first, and that upon every small occasion or
error:</q> as in Mercury's weather-beaten statue, that was once all over gilt,
the open parts were clean, yet there was <span lang="la">in fimbriis aurum</span>, in the chinks
a remnant of gold: there will be some relics of melancholy left in the
purest bodies (if once tainted) not so easily to be rooted out. <a href="#note2728">[2728]</a>
Oftentimes it degenerates into epilepsy, apoplexy, convulsions, and
blindness: by the authority of Hippocrates and Galen, <a href="#note2729">[2729]</a>all aver, if
once it possess the ventricles of the brain, Frambesarius, and Salust.
Salvianus adds, if it get into the optic nerves, blindness. Mercurialis,
<span class="cite">consil. 20</span>, had a woman to his patient, that from melancholy became
epileptic and blind. <a href="#note2730">[2730]</a>If it come from a cold cause, or so continue
cold, or increase, epilepsy; convulsions follow, and blindness, or else in
the end they are moped, sottish, and in all their actions, speeches, and
gestures, ridiculous. <a href="#note2731">[2731]</a>If it come from a hot cause, they are more
furious, and boisterous, and in conclusion mad. <span lang="la">Calescentem melancholiam
saepius sequitur mania</span>. <a href="#note2732">[2732]</a>If it heat and increase, that is the common
event, <a href="#note2733">[2733]</a><span lang="la">per circuitus, aut semper insanit</span>, he is mad by fits, or
altogether. For as <a href="#note2734">[2734]</a>Sennertus contends out of Crato, there is
<span lang="la">seminarius ignis</span> in this humour, the very seeds of fire. If it come from
melancholy natural adust, and in excess, they are often demoniacal,
Montanus.

<p><a href="#note2735">[2735]</a>Seldom this malady procures death, except (which is the greatest,
most grievous calamity, and the misery of all miseries,) they make away
themselves, which is a frequent thing, and familiar amongst them. 'Tis

<p>In such sort doth the torture and extremity of his misery torment him, that
he can take no pleasure in his life, but is in a manner enforced to offer
violence unto himself, to be freed from his present insufferable pains. So
some (saith <a href="#note2739">[2739]</a>Fracastorius) <q>in fury, but most in despair, sorrow,
fear, and out of the anguish and vexation of their souls, offer violence to
themselves: for their life is unhappy and miserable. They can take no rest
in the night, nor sleep, or if they do slumber, fearful dreams astonish
them.</q> In the daytime they are affrighted still by some terrible object,
and torn in pieces with suspicion, fear, sorrow, discontents, cares, shame,
anguish, &amp;c. as so many wild horses, that they cannot be quiet an hour, a
minute of time, but even against their wills they are intent, and still
thinking of it, they cannot forget it, it grinds their souls day and night,
they are perpetually tormented, a burden to themselves, as Job was, they
can neither eat, drink or sleep. <span class="bibcite">Psal. cvii. 18.</span> <q>Their soul abhorreth all
meat, and they are brought to death's door, <a href="#note2740">[2740]</a>being bound in misery
and iron:</q> they <a href="#note2741">[2741]</a>curse their stars with Job, <a href="#note2742">[2742]</a><q>and day of their
birth, and wish for death:</q> for as Pineda and most interpreters hold, Job
was even melancholy to despair, and almost <a href="#note2743">[2743]</a>madness itself; they
murmur many times against the world, friends, allies, all mankind, even
against God himself in the bitterness of their passion, <a href="#note2744">[2744]</a><span lang="la">vivere
nolunt, mori nesciunt</span>, live they will not, die they cannot. And in the
midst of these squalid, ugly, and such irksome days, they seek at last,
finding no comfort, <a href="#note2745">[2745]</a>no remedy in this wretched life, to be eased of
all by death. <span lang="la">Omnia appetunt bonum</span>, all creatures seek the best, and for
their good as they hope, <span lang="la">sub specie</span>, in show at least, <span lang="la">vel quia mori
pulchrum putant</span> (saith <a href="#note2746">[2746]</a>Hippocrates) <span lang="la">vel quia putant inde se
majoribus malis liberari</span>, to be freed as they wish. Though many times, as
Aesop's fishes, they leap from the frying-pan into the fire itself, yet they
hope to be eased by this means: and therefore (saith Felix <a href="#note2747">[2747]</a>Platerus)
<q>after many tedious days at last, either by drowning, hanging, or some such
fearful end,</q> they precipitate or make away themselves: <q>many lamentable
examples are daily seen amongst us:</q> <span lang="la">alius ante, fores se laqueo
suspendit</span> (as Seneca notes), <span lang="la">alius se praecipitavit a tecto, ne dominum
stomachantem audiret, alius ne reduceretur a fuga ferrum redegit in
viscera</span>, <q>one hangs himself before his own door,&mdash;another throws himself
from the house-top, to avoid his master's anger,&mdash;a third, to escape
expulsion, plunges a dagger into his heart,</q>&mdash;so many causes there
are&mdash;<span lang="la">His amor exitio est, furor his</span>&mdash;love, grief, anger, madness, and
shame, &amp;c. 'Tis a common calamity, <a href="#note2748">[2748]</a>a fatal end to this disease, they
are condemned to a violent death, by a jury of physicians, furiously
disposed, carried headlong by their tyrannising wills, enforced by
miseries, and there remains no more to such persons, if that heavenly
Physician, by his assisting grace and mercy alone do not prevent, (for no
human persuasion or art can help) but to be their own butchers, and execute
themselves. Socrates his <span lang="la">cicuta</span>, Lucretia's dagger, Timon's halter, are
yet to be had; Cato's knife, and Nero's sword are left behind them, as so
many fatal engines, bequeathed to posterity, and will be used to the
world's end, by such distressed souls: so intolerable, insufferable,
grievous, and violent is their pain, <a href="#note2749">[2749]</a>so unspeakable and continuate.
One day of grief is an hundred years, as Cardan observes: 'Tis <span lang="la">carnificina
hominum, angor animi</span>, as well saith Areteus, a plague of the soul, the
cramp and convulsion of the soul, an epitome of hell; and if there be a
hell upon earth, it is to be found in a melancholy man's heart.

Yea, that which scoffing Lucian said of the gout in jest, I may truly
affirm of melancholy in earnest.

All fears, griefs, suspicions, discontents, imbonites, insuavities are
swallowed up, and drowned in this Euripus, this Irish sea, this ocean of
misery, as so many small brooks; 'tis <span lang="la">coagulum omnium aerumnarum</span>: which
<a href="#note2753">[2753]</a>Ammianus applied to his distressed Palladins. I say of our
melancholy man, he is the cream of human adversity, the <a href="#note2754">[2754]</a>
quintessence, and upshot; all other diseases whatsoever, are but
flea-bitings to melancholy in extent: 'Tis the pith of them all, <a href="#note2755">[2755]</a>
<span lang="la">Hospitium est calamitatis; quid verbis opus est</span>?
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Quamcunque malam rem quaeris, illic reperies:</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">What need more words? 'tis calamities inn,</div>
<div class="line">Where seek for any mischief, 'tis within;</div>
</div>
and a melancholy man is that true Prometheus, which is bound to Caucasus;
the true Titius, whose bowels are still by a vulture devoured (as poets
feign) for so doth <a href="#note2756">[2756]</a>Lilius Geraldus interpret it, of anxieties, and
those griping cares, and so ought it to be understood. In all other
maladies, we seek for help, if a leg or an arm ache, through any
distemperature or wound, or that we have an ordinary disease, above all
things whatsoever, we desire help and health, a present recovery, if by any
means possible it may be procured; we will freely part with all our other
fortunes, substance, endure any misery, drink bitter potions, swallow those
distasteful pills, suffer our joints to be seared, to be cut off, anything
for future health: so sweet, so dear, so precious above all other things in
this world is life: 'tis that we chiefly desire, long life and happy days,
<a href="#note2757">[2757]</a><span lang="la">multos da Jupiter annos</span>, increase of years all men wish; but to a
melancholy man, nothing so tedious, nothing so odious; that which they so
carefully seek to preserve <a href="#note2758">[2758]</a>he abhors, he alone; so intolerable are
his pains; some make a question, <span lang="la">graviores morbi corporis an animi</span>,
whether the diseases of the body or mind be more grievous, but there is no
comparison, no doubt to be made of it, <span lang="la">multo enim saevior longeque est
atrocior animi, quam corporis cruciatus</span> (Lem. <span class="cite">l. 1. c. 12.</span>) the diseases
of the mind are far more grievous.&mdash;<span lang="la">Totum hic pro vulnere corpus</span>, body
and soul is misaffected here, but the soul especially. So Cardan testifies
<span class="cite">de rerum var. lib. 8. 40.</span> <a href="#note2759">[2759]</a>Maximus Tyrius a Platonist, and
Plutarch, have made just volumes to prove it. <a href="#note2760">[2760]</a><span lang="la">Dies adimit
aegritudinem hominibus</span>, in other diseases there is some hope likely, but
these unhappy men are born to misery, past all hope of recovery, incurably
sick, the longer they live the worse they are, and death alone must ease
them.

<p>Another doubt is made by some philosophers, whether it be lawful for a man
in such extremity of pain and grief, to make away himself: and how these
men that so do are to be censured. The Platonists approve of it, that it is
lawful in such cases, and upon a necessity; Plotinus <span class="cite">l. de beatitud. c.
7.</span> and Socrates himself defends it, in Plato's Phaedon, <q>if any man labour
of an incurable disease, he may despatch himself, if it be to his good.</q>
Epicurus and his followers, the cynics and stoics in general affirm it,
Epictetus and <a href="#note2761">[2761]</a>Seneca amongst the rest, <span lang="la">quamcunque veram esse viam
ad libertatem</span>, any way is allowable that leads to liberty, <a href="#note2762">[2762]</a><q>let us
give God thanks, that no man is compelled to live against his will;</q> <a href="#note2763">[2763]</a>
<span lang="la">quid ad hominem claustra, career, custodia? liberum ostium habet</span>, death
is always ready and at hand. <span lang="la">Vides illum praecipitem locum, illud flumen</span>,
dost thou see that steep place, that river, that pit, that tree, there's
liberty at hand, <span lang="la">effugia servitutis et doloris sunt</span>, as that Laconian lad
cast himself headlong (<span lang="la">non serviam aiebat puer</span>) to be freed of his
misery: every vein in thy body, if these be <span lang="la">nimis operosi exitus</span>, will
set thee free, <span lang="la">quid tua refert finem facias an accipias</span>? there's no
necessity for a man to live in misery. <span lang="la">Malum est necessitati vivere; sed
in necessitate vivere, necessitas nulla est. Ignavus qui sine causa
moritur, et stultus qui cum dolore vivit</span>. <span class="cite">Idem epi. 58.</span> Wherefore hath our
mother the earth brought out poisons, saith <a href="#note2764">[2764]</a>Pliny, in so great a
quantity, but that men in distress might make away themselves? which kings
of old had ever in a readiness, <span lang="la">ad incerta fortunae venenum sub custode
promptum</span>, Livy writes, and executioners always at hand. Speusippes being
sick was met by Diogenes, and carried on his slaves' shoulders, he made his
moan to the philosopher; but I pity thee not, quoth Diogenes, <span lang="la">qui cum
talis vivere sustines</span>, thou mayst be freed when thou wilt, meaning by
death. <a href="#note2765">[2765]</a>Seneca therefore commends Cato, Dido, and Lucretia, for their
generous courage in so doing, and others that voluntarily die, to avoid a
greater mischief, to free themselves from misery, to save their honour, or
vindicate their good name, as Cleopatra did, as Sophonisba, Syphax's wife
did, Hannibal did, as Junius Brutus, as Vibius Virus, and those Campanian
senators in Livy (<span class="cite">Dec. 3. lib. 6.</span>) to escape the Roman tyranny, that
poisoned themselves. Themistocles drank bull's blood, rather than he would
fight against his country, and Demosthenes chose rather to drink poison,
Publius Crassi <span lang="la">filius</span>, Censorius and Plancus, those heroical Romans to
make away themselves, than to fall into their enemies' hands. How many
myriads besides in all ages might I remember, <span lang="la">qui sibi lethum Insontes
pepperere manu</span>, &amp;c. <a href="#note2766">[2766]</a>Rhasis in the Maccabees is magnified for it,
Samson's death approved. So did Saul and Jonas sin, and many worthy men and
women, <span lang="la">quorum memoria celebratur in Ecclesia</span>, saith <a href="#note2767">[2767]</a>Leminchus, for
killing themselves to save their chastity and honour, when Rome was taken,
as Austin instances, <span class="cite">l. 1. de Civit. Dei, cap. 16.</span> Jerome vindicateth
the same in <span class="cite">Ionam</span> and Ambrose, <span class="cite">l. 3. de virginitate</span> commendeth Pelagia
for so doing. Eusebius, <span class="cite">lib. 8. cap. 15.</span> admires a Roman matron for the
same fact to save herself from the lust of Maxentius the Tyrant.
Adelhelmus, abbot of Malmesbury, calls them <span lang="la">Beatas virgines quae sic</span>, &amp;c.
Titus Pomponius Atticus, that wise, discreet, renowned Roman senator,
Tully's dear friend, when he had been long sick, as he supposed, of an
incurable disease, <span lang="la">vitamque produceret ad augendos dolores, sine spe
salutis</span>, was resolved voluntarily by famine to despatch himself to be rid
of his pain; and when as Agrippa, and the rest of his weeping friends
earnestly besought him, <span lang="la">osculantes obsecrarent ne id quod natura cogeret,
ipse acceleraret</span>, not to offer violence to himself, <q>with a settled
resolution he desired again they would approve of his good intent, and not
seek to dehort him from it:</q> and so constantly died, <span lang="la">precesque eorum
taciturna sua obstinatione depressit</span>. Even so did Corellius Rufus, another
grave senator, by the relation of Plinius Secundus, <span class="cite">epist. lib. 1.
epist. 12.</span> famish himself to death; <span lang="la">pedibus correptus cum incredibiles
cruciatus et indignissima tormenta pateretur, a cibis omnino abstinuit</span>;
<a href="#note2768">[2768]</a>neither he nor Hispilla his wife could divert him, but <span lang="la">destinatus
mori obstinate magis</span>, &amp;c. die he would, and die he did. So did Lycurgus,
Aristotle, Zeno, Chrysippus, Empedocles, with myriads, &amp;c. In wars for a
man to run rashly upon imminent danger, and present death, is accounted
valour and magnanimity, <a href="#note2769">[2769]</a>to be the cause of his own, and many a
thousand's ruin besides, to commit wilful murder in a manner, of himself
and others, is a glorious thing, and he shall be crowned for it. The <a href="#note2770">[2770]</a>
Massegatae in former times, <a href="#note2771">[2771]</a>Barbiccians, and I know not what nations
besides, did stifle their old men, after seventy years, to free them from
those grievances incident to that age. So did the inhabitants of the island
of Choa, because their air was pure and good, and the people generally long
lived, <span lang="la">antevertebant fatum suum, priusquam manci forent, aut imbecillitas
accederet, papavere vel cicuta</span>, with poppy or hemlock they prevented
death. Sir Thomas More in his Utopia commends voluntary death, if he be
<span lang="la">sibi aut aliis molestus</span>, troublesome to himself or others, (<a href="#note2772">[2772]</a>
<q>especially if to live be a torment to him,) let him free himself with his
own hands from this tedious life, as from a prison, or suffer himself to be
freed by others.</q> <a href="#note2773">[2773]</a>And 'tis the same tenet which Laertius relates of
Zeno, of old, <span lang="la">Juste sapiens sibi mortem consciscit, si in acerbis
doloribus versetur, membrorum mutilatione aut morbis aegre curandis</span>, and
which Plato <span class="cite">9. de legibus</span> approves, if old age, poverty, ignominy, &amp;c.
oppress, and which Fabius expresseth in effect. (<span class="cite">Praefat. 7. Institut</span>.)
<span lang="la">Nemo nisi sua culpa diu dolet</span>. It is an ordinary thing in China, (saith
Mat. Riccius the Jesuit,) <a href="#note2774">[2774]</a><q>if they be in despair of better fortunes,
or tired and tortured with misery, to bereave themselves of life, and many
times, to spite their enemies the more, to hang at their door.</q> Tacitus the
historian, Plutarch the philosopher, much approve a voluntary departure,
and Aust. <span class="cite">de civ. Dei, l. 1. c. 29.</span> defends a violent death, so that
it be undertaken in a good cause, <span lang="la">nemo sic mortuus, qui non fuerat</span>
<span lang="la">aliquando moriturus</span>; <span lang="la">quid autem interest, quo mortis genere vita ista
finiatur, quando ille cui finitur, iterum mori non cogitur</span>? &amp;c. <a href="#note2775">[2775]</a>no
man so voluntarily dies, but <span lang="la">volens nolens</span>, he must die at last, and our
life is subject to innumerable casualties, who knows when they may happen,
<span lang="la">utrum satius est unam perpeti moriendo, an omnes timere vivendo</span>, <a href="#note2776">[2776]</a>
rather suffer one, than fear all. <q>Death is better than a bitter life,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Eccl. xxx. 17.</span> <a href="#note2777">[2777]</a>and a harder choice to live in fear, than by once
dying, to be freed from all. Theombrotus Ambraciotes persuaded I know not
how many hundreds of his auditors, by a luculent oration he made of the
miseries of this, and happiness of that other life, to precipitate
themselves. And having read Plato's divine tract <span class="cite">de anima</span>, for example's
sake led the way first. That neat epigram of Callimachus will tell you as
much,

<a href="#note2779">[2779]</a>Calenus and his Indians hated of old to die a natural death: the
Circumcellians and Donatists, loathing life, compelled others to make them
away, with many such: <a href="#note2780">[2780]</a>but these are false and pagan positions,
profane stoical paradoxes, wicked examples, it boots not what heathen
philosophers determine in this kind, they are impious, abominable, and upon
a wrong ground. <q>No evil is to be done that good may come of it;</q> <span lang="la">reclamat
Christus, reclamat Scriptura</span>, God, and all good men are <a href="#note2781">[2781]</a>against it:
He that stabs another, can kill his body; but he that stabs himself, kills
his own soul. <a href="#note2782">[2782]</a><span lang="la">Male meretur, qui dat mendico, quod edat</span>; <span lang="la">nam et
illud quod dat, perit</span>; <span lang="la">et illi producit vitam ad miseriam</span>: he that
gives a beggar an alms (as that comical poet said) doth ill, because he
doth but prolong his miseries. But Lactantius <span class="cite">l. 6. c. 7. de vero
cultu</span>, calls it a detestable opinion, and fully confutes it, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de
sap. cap. 18.</span> and S. Austin, <span class="cite">epist. 52. ad Macedonium, cap. 61. ad
Dulcitium Tribunum</span>: so doth Hierom to Marcella of Blesilla's death, <span lang="la">Non
recipio tales animas</span>, &amp;c., he calls such men <span lang="la">martyres stultae
Philosophiae</span>: so doth Cyprian <span lang="la">de duplici martyrio; Si qui sic
moriantur, aut infirmitas, aut ambitio, aut dementia cogit eos</span>; 'tis mere
madness so to do, <a href="#note2783">[2783]</a><span lang="la">furore est ne moriare mori</span>. To this effect
writes Arist. <span class="cite">3. Ethic.</span> Lipsius <span class="cite">Manuduc. ad Stoicam Philosophiaem
lib. 3. dissertat. 23.</span> but it needs no confutation. This only let me
add, that in some cases, those <a href="#note2784">[2784]</a>hard censures of such as offer
violence to their own persons, or in some desperate fit to others, which
sometimes they do, by stabbing, slashing, &amp;c. are to be mitigated, as in
such as are mad, beside themselves for the time, or found to have been long
melancholy, and that in extremity, they know not what they do, deprived of
reason, judgment, all, <a href="#note2785">[2785]</a>as a ship that is void of a pilot, must needs
impinge upon the next rock or sands, and suffer shipwreck. <a href="#note2786">[2786]</a>P.
Forestus hath a story of two melancholy brethren, that made away
themselves, and for so foul a fact, were accordingly censured to be
infamously buried, as in such cases they use: to terrify others, as it did
the Milesian virgins of old; but upon farther examination of their misery
and madness, the censure was <a href="#note2787">[2787]</a>revoked, and they were solemnly
interred, as Saul was by David, <span class="bibcite">2 Sam. ii. 4.</span> and Seneca well adviseth,
<span lang="la">Irascere interfectori, sed miserere interfecti</span>; be justly offended with
him as he was a murderer, but pity him now as a dead man. Thus of their
goods and bodies we can dispose; but what shall become of their souls, God
alone can tell; his mercy may come <span lang="la">inter pontem et fontem, inter gladium
et jugulum</span>, betwixt the bridge and the brook, the knife and the throat.
<span lang="la">Quod cuiquam contigit, quivis potest</span>: Who knows how he may be tempted? It
is his case, it may be thine: <a href="#note2788">[2788]</a><span lang="la">Quae sua sors hodie est, eras fore
vestra potest.</span> We ought not to be so rash and rigorous in our censures, as
some are; charity will judge and hope the best: God be merciful unto us
all.

<div class="note"><a name="note2103">2103</a>. As for ourselves (for neither are we free from this fault) the same guilt, the same crime, may be objected against us: for it is through our fault, negligence, and avarice, that so many and such shameful corruptions occur in the church (both the temple and the Deity are offered for sale), that such sordidness is introduced, such impiety committed, such wickedness, such a mad gulf of wretchedness and irregularity&mdash;these I say arise from all our faults, but more particularly from ours of the University. We are the nursery in which those ills are bred with which the state is afflicted; we voluntarily introduce them, and are deserving of every opprobrium and suffering, since we do not afterwards encounter them according to our strength. For what better can we expect when so many poor, beggarly fellows, men of every order, are readily and without election, admitted to degrees? Who, if they can only commit to memory a few definitions and divisions, and pass the customary period in the study of logics, no matter with what effect, whatever sort they prove to be, idiots, triflers, idlers, gamblers, sots, sensualists, <div class="poem"> <div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;mere ciphers in the book of life</div> <div class="line">Like those who boldly woo'd Ulysses' wife;</div> <div class="line">Born to consume the fruits of earth: in truth,</div> <div class="line">As vain and idle as Pheacia's youth;</div> </div> only let them have passed the stipulated period in the University, and professed themselves collegians: either for the sake of profit, or through the influence of their friends, they obtain a presentation; nay, sometimes even accompanied by brilliant eulogies upon their morals and acquirements; and when they are about to take leave, they are honoured with the most flattering literary testimonials in their favour, by those who undoubtedly sustain a loss of reputation in granting them. For doctors and professors (as an author says) are anxious about one thing only, viz., that out of their various callings they may promote their own advantage, and convert the public loss into their private gains. For our annual officers wish this only, that those who commence, whether they are taught or untaught is of no moment, shall be sleek, fat, pigeons, worth the plucking. The Philosophastic are admitted to a degree in Arts, because they have no acquaintance with them. And they are desired to be wise men, because they are endowed with no wisdom, and bring no qualification for a degree, except the wish to have it. The Theologastic (only let them pay) thrice learned, are promoted to every academic honour. Hence it is that so many vile buffoons, so many idiots everywhere, placed in the twilight of letters, the mere ghosts of scholars, wanderers in the market place, vagrants, barbels, mushrooms, dolts, asses, a growling herd, with unwashed feet, break into the sacred precincts of theology, bringing nothing along with them but an impudent front, some vulgar trifles and foolish scholastic technicalities, unworthy of respect even at the crossing of the highways. This is the unworthy, vagrant, voluptuous race, fitter for the hog sty (haram) than the altar (aram), that basely prostitute divine literature; these are they who fill the pulpits, creep into the palaces of our nobility after all other prospects of existence fail them, owing to their imbecility of body and mind, and their being incapable of sustaining any other parts in the commonwealth; to this sacred refuge they fly, undertaking the office of the ministry, not from sincerity, but as St. Paul says, huckstering the word of God. Let not any one suppose that it is here intended to detract from those many exemplary men of which the Church of England may boast, learned, eminent, and of spotless fame, for they are more numerous in that than in any other church of Europe: nor from those most learned universities which constantly send forth men endued with every form of virtue. And these seminaries would produce a still greater number of inestimable scholars hereafter if sordidness did not obscure the splendid light, corruption interrupt, and certain truckling harpies and beggars envy them their usefulness. Nor can any one be so blind as not to perceive this&mdash;any so stolid as not to understand it&mdash;any so perverse as not to acknowledge how sacred Theology has been contaminated by those notorious idiots, and the celestial Muse treated with profanity. Vile and shameless souls (says Luther) for the sake of gain, like flies to a milk-pail, crowd round the tables of the nobility in expectation of a church living, any office, or honour, and flock into any public hall or city ready to accept of any employment that may offer. <q>A thing of wood and wires by others played.</q> Following the paste as the parrot, they stutter out anything in hopes of reward: obsequious parasites, says Erasmus, teach, say, write, admire, approve, contrary to their conviction, anything you please, not to benefit the people but to improve their own fortunes. They subscribe to any opinions and decisions contrary to the word of God, that they may not offend their patron, but retain the favour of the great, the applause of the multitude, and thereby acquire riches for themselves; for they approach Theology, not that they may perform a sacred duty, but make a fortune: nor to promote the interests of the church, but to pillage it: seeking, as Paul says, not the things which are of Jesus Christ, but what may be their own: not the treasure of their Lord, but the enrichment of themselves and their followers. Nor does this evil belong to those of humbler birth and fortunes only, it possesses the middle and higher ranks, <i>bishops excepted</i>. <q>O Pontiffs, tell the efficacy of gold in sacred matters!</q> Avarice often leads the highest men astray, and men, admirable in all other respects: these find a salvo for simony; and, striking against this rock of corruption, they do not shear but flay the flock; and, wherever they teem, plunder, exhaust, raze, making shipwreck of their reputation, if not of their souls also. Hence it appears that this malady did not flow from the humblest to the highest classes, but <i>vice versa</i>, so that the maxim is true although spoken in jest&mdash;<q>he bought first, therefore has the best right to sell.</q> For a Simoniac (that I may use the phraseology of Leo) has not received a favour; since he has not received one he does not possess one; and since he does not possess one he cannot confer one. So far indeed are some of those who are placed at the helm from promoting others, that they completely obstruct them, from a consciousness of the means by which themselves obtained the honour. For he who imagines that they emerged from their obscurity through their learning, is deceived; indeed, whoever supposes promotion to be the reward of genius, erudition, experience, probity, piety, and poetry (which formerly was the case, but nowadays is only promised) is evidently deranged. How or when this malady commenced, I shall not further inquire; but from these beginnings, this accumulation of vices, all her calamities and miseries have been brought upon the Church; hence such frequent acts of simony, complaints, fraud, impostures&mdash; from this one fountain spring all its conspicuous iniquities. I shall not press the question of ambition and courtly flattery, lest they may be chagrined about luxury, base examples of life, which offend the honest, wanton drinking parties, &amp;c. Yet; hence is that academic squalor, the muses now look sad, since every low fellow ignorant of the arts, by those very arts rises, is promoted, and grows rich, distinguished by ambitious titles, and puffed up by his numerous honours; he just shows himself to the vulgar, and by his stately carriage displays a species of majesty, a remarkable solicitude, letting down a flowing beard, decked in a brilliant toga resplendent with purple, and respected also on account of the splendour of his household and number of his servants. There are certain statues placed in sacred edifices that seem to sink under their load, and almost to perspire, when in reality they are void of sensation, and do not contribute to the stony stability, so these men would wish to look like Atlases, when they are no better than statues of stone, insignificant scrubs, funguses, dolts, little different from stone. Meanwhile really learned men, endowed with all that can adorn a holy life, men who have endured the heat of mid-day, by some unjust lot obey these, dizzards, content probably with a miserable salary, known by honest appellations, humble, obscure, although eminently worthy, needy, leading a private life without honour, buried alive in some poor benefice, or incarcerated for ever in their college chambers, lying hid ingloriously. But I am unwilling to stir this sink any longer or any deeper; hence those tears, this melancholy habit of the muses; hence (that I may speak with Secellius) is it that religion is brought into disrepute and contempt, and the priesthood abject; (and since this is so, I must speak out and use a filthy witticism of the filthy) a foetid. crowd, poor, sordid, melancholy, miserable, despicable, contemptible.</div>
