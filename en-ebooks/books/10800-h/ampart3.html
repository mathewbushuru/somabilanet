<h2><a name="3.1.1.1"></a>THE THIRD PARTITION,</h2>
<h2>LOVE-MELANCHOLY.</h2>
<div class="section">
<div class="member">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>THE FIRST SECTION, MEMBER, SUBSECTION.</h3>
<h4><i>The Preface</i>.</h4>

<p>There will not be wanting, I presume, one or other that will much
discommend some part of this treatise of love-melancholy, and object (which
<a href="#note4414">[4414]</a>Erasmus in his preface to Sir Thomas More suspects of his) <q>that it
is too light for a divine, too comical a subject to speak of love symptoms,
too fantastical, and fit alone for a wanton poet, a feeling young lovesick
gallant, an effeminate courtier, or some such idle person.</q> And 'tis true
they say: for by the naughtiness of men it is so come to pass, as <a href="#note4415">[4415]</a>
Caussinus observes, <span lang="la">ut castis auribus vox amoris suspecta sit, et invisa</span>,
the very name of love is odious to chaster ears; and therefore some again,
out of an affected gravity, will dislike all for the name's sake before
they read a word; dissembling with him in <a href="#note4416">[4416]</a>Petronius, and seem to be
angry that their ears are violated with such obscene speeches, that so they
may be admired for grave philosophers and staid carriage. They cannot abide
to hear talk of love toys, or amorous discourses, <span lang="la">vultu, gestu, oculis</span> in
their outward actions averse, and yet in their cogitations they are all out
as bad, if not worse than others.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4417">[4417]</a>Erubuit, posuitque meum Lucretia librum</div>
<div class="line">Sed coram Bruto, Brute recede, legit.</div>
</div>
But let these cavillers and counterfeit Catos know, that as the Lord John
answered the Queen in that Italian <a href="#note4418">[4418]</a>Guazzo, an old, a grave discreet
man is fittest to discourse of love matters, because he hath likely more
experience, observed more, hath a more staid judgment, can better discern,
resolve, discuss, advise, give better cautions, and more solid precepts,
better inform his auditors in such a subject, and by reason of his riper
years sooner divert. Besides, <span lang="la">nihil in hac amoris voce subtimendum</span>, there
is nothing here to be excepted at; love is a species of melancholy, and a
necessary part of this my treatise, which I may not omit; <span lang="la">operi suscepto
inserviendum fuit</span>: so Jacobus Mysillius pleadeth for himself in his
translation of Lucian's dialogues, and so do I; I must and will perform my
task. And that short excuse of Mercerus, for his edition of Aristaenetus
shall be mine, <a href="#note4419">[4419]</a><q>If I have spent my time ill to write, let not them
be so idle as to read.</q> But I am persuaded it is not so ill spent, I ought
not to excuse or repent myself of this subject; on which many grave and
worthy men have written whole volumes, Plato, Plutarch, Plotinus, Maximus,
Tyrius, Alcinous, Avicenna, Leon Hebreus in three large dialogues, Xenophon
<span class="cite">sympos.</span> Theophrastus, if we may believe Athenaeus, <span class="cite">lib. 13. cap. 9.</span>
Picus Mirandula, Marius, Aequicola, both in Italian, Kornmannus <span class="cite">de linea
Amoris, lib. 3.</span> Petrus Godefridus hath handled in three books, P. Haedus,
and which almost every physician, as Arnoldus, Villanovanus, Valleriola
<span class="cite">observat. med. lib. 2. observ. 7.</span> Aelian Montaltus and Laurentius in their
treatises of melancholy, Jason Pratensis <span class="cite">de morb. cap.</span> Valescus de
Taranta, Gordonius, Hercules de Saxonia, Savanarola, Langius, &amp;c., have
treated of apart, and in their works. I excuse myself, therefore, with
Peter Godefridus, Valleriola, Ficinus, and in <a href="#note4420">[4420]</a>Langius' words. Cadmus
Milesius writ fourteen books of love, <q>and why should I be ashamed to write
an epistle in favour of young men, of this subject?</q> A company of stern
readers dislike the second of the Aeneids, and Virgil's gravity, for
inserting such amorous passions in an heroical subject; but <a href="#note4421">[4421]</a>Servius,
his commentator, justly vindicates the poet's worth, wisdom, and discretion
in doing as he did. Castalio would not have young men read the <a href="#note4422">[4422]</a>
Canticles, because to his thinking it was too light and amorous a tract, a
ballad of ballads, as our old English translation hath it. He might as well
forbid the reading of Genesis, because of the loves of Jacob and Rachael,
the stories of Sichem and Dinah, Judah and Thamar; reject the Book of
Numbers, for the fornications of the people of Israel with the Moabites;
that of Judges for Samson and Dalilah's embracings; that of the Kings, for
David and Bersheba's adulteries, the incest of Ammon and Thamar, Solomon's
concubines, &amp;c. The stories of Esther, Judith, Susanna, and many such.
Dicearchus, and some other, carp at Plato's majesty, that he would
vouchsafe to indite such love toys: amongst the rest, for that dalliance
with Agatho,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">Suavia dans Agathoni, animam ipse in labra tenebam;</div>
<div class="line">Aegra etenim properans tanquam abitura fuit.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For my part, saith <a href="#note4423">[4423]</a>Maximus Tyrius, a great Platonist himself, <span lang="la">me
non tantum admiratio habet, sed eliam stupor</span>, I do not only admire, but
stand amazed to read, that Plato and Socrates both should expel Homer from
their city, because he writ of such light and wanton subjects, <span lang="la">Quod
Junonem cum Jove in Ida concumbentes inducit, ab immortali nube contectos</span>,
Vulcan's net. Mars and Venus' fopperies before all the gods, because Apollo
fled, when he was persecuted by Achilles, the <a href="#note4424">[4424]</a>gods were wounded and
ran whining away, as Mars that roared louder than Stentor, and covered nine
acres of ground with his fall; Vulcan was a summer's day falling down from
heaven, and in Lemnos Isle brake his leg, &amp;c., with such ridiculous
passages; when, as both Socrates and Plato, by his testimony, writ lighter
themselves: <span lang="la">quid enim tam distat</span> (as he follows it) <span lang="la">quam amans a
temperante, formarum admirator a demente</span>, what can be more absurd than for
grave philosophers to treat of such fooleries, to admire Autiloquus,
Alcibiades, for their beauties as they did, to run after, to gaze, to dote
on fair Phaedrus, delicate Agatho, young Lysis, fine Charmides, <span lang="la">haeccine
Philosophum decent</span>? Doth this become grave philosophers? Thus peradventure
Callias, Thrasimachus, Polus, Aristophanes, or some of his adversaries and
emulators might object; but neither they nor <a href="#note4425">[4425]</a>Anytus and Melitus his
bitter enemies, that condemned him for teaching Critias to tyrannise, his
impiety for swearing by dogs and plain trees, for his juggling sophistry,
&amp;c., never so much as upbraided him with impure love, writing or speaking
of that subject; and therefore without question, as he concludes, both
Socrates and Plato in this are justly to be excused. But suppose they had
been a little overseen, should divine Plato be defamed? no, rather as he
said of Cato's drunkenness, if Cato were drunk, it should be no vice at all
to be drunk. They reprove Plato then, but without cause (as <a href="#note4426">[4426]</a>Ficinus
pleads) <q>for all love is honest and good, and they are worthy to be loved
that speak well of love.</q> Being to speak of this admirable affection of
love (saith <a href="#note4427">[4427]</a>Valleriola) <q>there lies open a vast and philosophical
field to my discourse, by which many lovers become mad; let me leave my
more serious meditations, wander in these philosophical fields, and look
into those pleasant groves of the Muses, where with unspeakable variety of
flowers, we may make garlands to ourselves, not to adorn us only, but with
their pleasant smell and juice to nourish our souls, and fill our minds
desirous of knowledge,</q> &amp;c. After a harsh and unpleasing discourse of
melancholy, which hath hitherto molested your patience, and tired the
author, give him leave with <a href="#note4428">[4428]</a>Godefridus the lawyer, and Laurentius
(<span class="cite">cap. 5.</span>) to recreate himself in this kind after his laborious studies,
<q>since so many grave divines and worthy men have without offence to
manners, to help themselves and others, voluntarily written of it.</q>
Heliodorus, a bishop, penned a love story of Theagines and Chariclea, and
when some Catos of his time reprehended him for it, chose rather, saith
<a href="#note4429">[4429]</a>Nicephorus, to leave his bishopric than his book. Aeneas Sylvius, an
ancient divine, and past forty years of age, (as <a href="#note4430">[4430]</a>he confesseth
himself, after Pope Pius Secundus) indited that wanton history of Euryalus
and Lucretia. And how many superintendents of learning could I reckon up
that have written of light fantastical subjects? Beroaldus, Erasmus,
Alpheratius, twenty-four times printed in Spanish, &amp;c. Give me leave then
to refresh my muse a little, and my weary readers, to expatiate in this
delightsome field, <span lang="la">hoc deliciarum campo</span>, as Fonseca terms it, to <a href="#note4431">[4431]</a>
season a surly discourse with a more pleasing aspersion of love matters:
<span lang="la">Edulcare vitam convenit</span>, as the poet invites us, <span lang="la">curas nugis</span>, &amp;c., 'tis
good to sweeten our life with some pleasing toys to relish it, and as Pliny
tells us, <span lang="la">magna pars studiosorum amaenitates quaerimus</span>, most of our
students love such pleasant <a href="#note4432">[4432]</a>subjects. Though Macrobius teach us
otherwise, <a href="#note4433">[4433]</a><q>that those old sages banished all such light tracts from
their studies, to nurse's cradles, to please only the ear;</q> yet out of
Apuleius I will oppose as honourable patrons, Solon, Plato, <a href="#note4434">[4434]</a>
Xenophon, Adrian, &amp;c. that as highly approve of these treatises. On the
other side methinks they are not to be disliked, they are not so unfit. I
will not peremptorily say as one did <a href="#note4435">[4435]</a><span lang="la">tam suavia dicam facinora, ut
male sit ei qui talibus non delectetur</span>, I will tell you such pretty
stories, that foul befall him that is not pleased with them; <span lang="la">Neque dicam
ea quae vobis usui sit audivisse, et voluptati meminisse</span>, with that
confidence, as Beroaldus doth his enarrations on Propertius. I will not
expert or hope for that approbation, which Lipsius gives to his Epictetus;
<span lang="la">pluris facio quum relego; semper ut novum, et quum repetivi, repetendum</span>,
the more I read, the more shall I covet to read. I will not press you with
my pamphlets, or beg attention, but if you like them you may. Pliny holds
it expedient, and most fit, <span lang="la">severitatem jucunditate etiam in scriptis
condire</span>, to season our works with some pleasant discourse; Synesius
approves it, <span lang="la">licet in ludicris ludere</span>, the <a href="#note4436">[4436]</a>poet admires it, <span lang="la">Omne
tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci</span>; and there be those, without
question, that are more willing to read such toys, than <a href="#note4437">[4437]</a>I am to
write: <q>Let me not live,</q> saith Aretine's Antonia, <q>If I had not rather
hear thy discourse, <a href="#note4438">[4438]</a>than see a play?</q> No doubt but there be more of
her mind, ever have been, ever will be, as <a href="#note4439">[4439]</a>Hierome bears me witness.
A far greater part had rather read Apuleius than Plato: Tully himself
confesseth he could not understand Plato's Timaeus, and therefore cared less
for it: but every schoolboy hath that famous testament of Grunnius
Corocotta Porcellus at his fingers' ends. The comical poet,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4440">[4440]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Id sibi negoti credidit solum dari,</div>
<div class="line">Populo ut placrent, quas fecissit fabulas,</div>
</div>
made this his only care and sole study to please the people, tickle the
ear, and to delight; but mine earnest intent is as much to profit as to
please; <span lang="la">non tam ut populo placerem, quam ut populum juvarem</span>, and these my
writings, I hope, shall take like gilded pills, which are so composed as
well to tempt the appetite, and deceive the palate, as to help and
medicinally work upon the whole body; my lines shall not only recreate, but
rectify the mind. I think I have said enough; if not, let him that is
otherwise minded, remember that of <a href="#note4441">[4441]</a>Maudarensis, <q>he was in his life
a philosopher</q> (as Ausonius apologiseth for him), <q>in his epigrams a lover,
in his precepts most severe; in his epistle to Caerellia, a wanton.</q>
Annianus, Sulpicius, Evemus, Menander, and many old poets besides, did <span lang="la">in
scriptis prurire</span>, write Fescennines, Atellans, and lascivious songs;
<span lang="la">laetam materiam</span>; yet they had <span lang="la">in moribus censuram, et severitatem</span>, they
were chaste, severe, and upright livers.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

</div>
I am of Catullus' opinion, and make the same apology in mine own behalf;
<span lang="la">Hoc etiam quod scribo, pendet plerumque ex aliorum sententia et
auctoritate; nec ipse forsan insanio, sed insanientes sequor. Atqui detur
hoc insanire me; Semel insanivimus omnes, et tute ipse opinor insanis

nihil alienum puto</span>:<a href="#note4444">[4444]</a> And which he urgeth for himself, accused of the
like fault, I as justly plead, <a href="#note4445">[4445]</a><span lang="la">lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba
est</span>. Howsoever my lines err, my life is honest, <a href="#note4446">[4446]</a><span lang="la">vita verecunda
est, musa jocosa mihi</span>. But I presume I need no such apologies, I need not,
as Socrates in Plato, cover his face when he spake of love, or blush and
hide mine eyes, as Pallas did in her hood, when she was consulted by
Jupiter about Mercury's marriage, <span lang="la">quod, super nuptiis virgo consulitur</span>,
it is no such lascivious, obscene, or wanton discourse; I have not offended
your chaster ears with anything that is here written, as many French and
Italian authors in their modern language of late have done, nay some of our
Latin pontificial writers, Zanches, Asorius, Abulensis, Burchardus, &amp;c.,
whom <a href="#note4447">[4447]</a>Rivet accuseth to be more lascivious than Virgil in Priapeiis,
Petronius in Catalectis, Aristophanes in Lycistratae, Martialis, or any
other pagan profane writer, <span lang="la">qui tam atrociter</span> (<a href="#note4448">[4448]</a>one notes) <span lang="la">hoc

part serious, and even of religion itself. <a href="#note4449">[4449]</a><q>Incensed</q> (as he said)
<q>with the love of finding love, we have sought it, and found it.</q> More yet,
I have augmented and added something to this light treatise (if light)
which was not in the former editions, I am not ashamed to confess it, with
a good <a href="#note4450">[4450]</a>author, <span lang="la">quod extendi et locupletari hoc subjectum plerique

<p>And thus much I have thought good to say by way of preface, lest any man
(which <a href="#note4453">[4453]</a>Godefridus feared in his book) should blame in me lightness,
wantonness, rashness, in speaking of love's causes, enticements, symptoms,
remedies, lawful and unlawful loves, and lust itself, <a href="#note4454">[4454]</a>I speak it
only to tax and deter others from it, not to teach, but to show the
vanities and fopperies of this heroical or Herculean love,<a href="#note4455">[4455]</a>and to
apply remedies unto it. I will treat of this with like liberty as of the
rest.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

</div>
Condemn me not good reader then, or censure me hardly, if some part of this
treatise to thy thinking as yet be too light; but consider better of it;
<span lang="la">Omnia munda mundis</span>, <a href="#note4457">[4457]</a>a naked man to a modest woman is no otherwise
than a picture, as Augusta Livia truly said, and <a href="#note4458">[4458]</a><span lang="la">mala mens, malus
animus</span>, 'tis as 'tis taken. If in thy censure it be too light, I advise
thee as Lipsius did his reader for some places of Plautus, <span lang="la">istos quasi
Sirenum scopulos praetervehare</span>, if they like thee not, let them pass; or
oppose that which is good to that which is bad, and reject not therefore
all. For to invert that verse of Martial, and with Hierom Wolfius to apply
it to my present purpose, <span lang="la">sunt mala, sunt quaedam mediocria, sunt bona
plura</span>; some is good, some bad, some is indifferent. I say further with him
yet, I have inserted (<a href="#note4459">[4459]</a><span lang="la">levicula quaedam et ridicula ascribere non sum
gravatus, circumforanea quaedam e theatris, e plateis, etiam e popinis</span>)
some things more homely, light, or comical, <span lang="la">litans gratiis</span>, &amp;c. which I
would request every man to interpret to the best, and as Julius Caesar
Scaliger besought Cardan (<span lang="la">si quid urbaniuscule lusum a nobis, per deos
immortales te oro Hieronyme Cardane ne me male capias</span>). I beseech thee,
good reader, not to mistake me, or misconstrue what is here written; <span lang="la">Per
Musas et Charites, et omnia Poetarum numina, benigne lector, oro te ne me
male capias</span>. 'Tis a comical subject; in sober sadness I crave pardon of
what is amiss, and desire thee to suspend thy judgment, wink at small
faults, or to be silent at least; but if thou likest, speak well of it, and
wish me good success. <span lang="la">Extremum hunc Arethusa mihi concede laborem</span>.<a href="#note4460">[4460]</a>

<p>I am resolved howsoever, <span lang="la">velis, nolis, audacter stadium intrare</span>, in the
Olympics, with those Aeliensian wrestlers in Philostratus, boldly to show
myself in this common stage, and in this tragicomedy of love, to act
several parts, some satirically, some comically, some in a mixed tone, as
the subject I have in hand gives occasion, and present scene shall require,
or offer itself.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.1.1.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Love's Beginning, Object, Definition, Division</i>.</h4>

<p><q>Love's limits are ample and great, and a spacious walk it hath, beset with
thorns,</q> and for that cause, which <a href="#note4461">[4461]</a>Scaliger reprehends in Cardan, <q>not
lightly to be passed over.</q> Lest I incur the same censure, 1 will examine
all the kinds of love, his nature, beginning, difference, objects, how it
is honest or dishonest, a virtue or vice, a natural passion, or a disease,
his power and effects, how far it extends: of which, although something has
been said in the first partition, in those sections of perturbations (<a href="#note4462">[4462]</a>
<q>for love and hatred are the first and most common passions, from which all
the rest arise, and are attendant,</q> as Picolomineus holds, or as Nich.
Caussinus, the <span lang="la">primum mobile</span> of all other affections, which carry them
all about them) I will now more copiously dilate, through all his parts and
several branches, that so it may better appear what love is, and how it
varies with the objects, how in defect, or (which is most ordinary and
common) immoderate, and in excess, causeth melancholy.

<p>Love universally taken, is defined to be a desire, as a word of more ample
signification: and though Leon Hebreus, the most copious writer of this
subject, in his third dialogue make no difference, yet in his first he
distinguisheth them again, and defines love by desire. <a href="#note4463">[4463]</a><q>Love is a
voluntary affection, and desire to enjoy that which is good. <a href="#note4464">[4464]</a>Desire
wisheth, love enjoys; the end of the one is the beginning of the other;
that which we love is present; that which we desire is absent.</q> <a href="#note4465">[4465]</a><q>It is
worth the labour,</q> saith Plotinus, <q>to consider well of love, whether it be
a god or a devil, or passion of the mind, or partly god, partly devil,
partly passion.</q> He concludes love to participate of all three, to arise
from desire of that which is beautiful and fair, and defines it to be <q>an
action of the mind desiring that which is good.</q> <a href="#note4466">[4466]</a>Plato calls it the
great devil, for its vehemency, and sovereignty over all other passions,
and defines it an appetite, <a href="#note4467">[4467]</a><q>by which we desire some good to be
present.</q> Ficinus in his comment adds the word fair to this definition.
Love is a desire of enjoying that which is good and fair. Austin dilates
this common definition, and will have love to be a delectation of the
heart, <a href="#note4468">[4468]</a><q>for something which we seek to win, or joy to have, coveting
by desire, resting in joy.</q> <a href="#note4469">[4469]</a>Scaliger <span class="cite">exerc. 301.</span> taxeth these
former definitions, and will not have love to be defined by desire or
appetite; <q>for when we enjoy the things we desire, there remains no more
appetite:</q> as he defines it, <q>Love is an affection by which we are either
united to the thing we love, or perpetuate our union;</q> which agrees in part
with Leon Hebreus.

<p>Now this love varies as its object varies, which is always good, amiable,
fair, gracious, and pleasant. <a href="#note4470">[4470]</a><q>All things desire that which is
good,</q> as we are taught in the Ethics, or at least that which to them seems
to be good; <span lang="la">quid enim vis mali</span> (as Austin well infers) <span lang="la">dic mihi? puto
nihil in omnibus actionibus</span>; thou wilt wish no harm, I suppose, no ill in
all thine actions, thoughts or desires, <span lang="la">nihil mali vis</span>; <a href="#note4471">[4471]</a>thou wilt
not have bad corn, bad soil, a naughty tree, but all good; a good servant,
a good horse, a good son, a good friend, a good neighbour, a good wife.
From this goodness comes beauty; from beauty, grace, and comeliness, which
result as so many rays from their good parts, make us to love, and so to
covet it: for were it not pleasing and gracious in our eyes, we should not
seek. <a href="#note4472">[4472]</a><q>No man loves</q> (saith Aristotle <span class="cite">9. mor. cap. 5.</span>) <q>but he that
was first delighted with comeliness and beauty.</q> As this fair object
varies, so doth our love; for as Proclus holds, <span lang="la">Omne pulchrum amabile</span>,
every fair thing is amiable, and what we love is fair and gracious in our
eyes, or at least we do so apprehend and still esteem of it. <a href="#note4473">[4473]</a>
<q>Amiableness is the object of love, the scope and end is to obtain it, for
whose sake we love, and which our mind covets to enjoy.</q> And it seems to us
especially fair and good; for good, fair, and unity, cannot be separated.
Beauty shines, Plato saith, and by reason of its splendour and shining
causeth admiration; and the fairer the object is, the more eagerly it is
sought. For as the same Plato defines it, <a href="#note4474">[4474]</a><q>Beauty is a lively,
shining or glittering brightness, resulting from effused good, by ideas,
seeds, reasons, shadows, stirring up our minds, that by this good they may
be united and made one.</q> Others will have beauty to be the perfection of the
whole composition, <a href="#note4475">[4475]</a><q>caused out of the congruous symmetry, measure,
order and manner of parts, and that comeliness which proceeds from this
beauty is called grace, and from thence all fair things are gracious.</q> For
grace and beauty are so wonderfully annexed, <a href="#note4476">[4476]</a><q>so sweetly and gently
win our souls, and strongly allure, that they confound our judgment and
cannot be distinguished. Beauty and grace are like those beams and shinings
that come from the glorious and divine sun,</q> which are diverse, as they
proceed from the diverse objects, to please and affect our several senses.
<a href="#note4477">[4477]</a><q>As the species of beauty are taken at our eyes, ears, or conceived
in our inner soul,</q> as Plato disputes at large in his <span class="cite">Dialogue de pulchro,
Phaedro, Hyppias</span>, and after many sophistical errors confuted, concludes
that beauty is a grace in all things, delighting the eyes, ears, and soul
itself; so that, as Valesius infers hence, whatsoever pleaseth our ears,
eyes, and soul, must needs be beautiful, fair, and delightsome to us.
<a href="#note4478">[4478]</a><q>And nothing can more please our ears than music, or pacify our
minds.</q> Fair houses, pictures, orchards, gardens, fields, a fair hawk, a
fair horse is most acceptable unto us; whatsoever pleaseth our eyes and
ears, we call beautiful and fair; <a href="#note4479">[4479]</a><q>Pleasure belongeth to the rest of
the senses, but grace and beauty to these two alone.</q> As the objects vary
and are diverse, so they diversely affect our eyes, ears, and soul itself.
Which gives occasion to some to make so many several kinds of love as there
be objects. One beauty ariseth from God, of which and divine love S.
Dionysius, <a href="#note4480">[4480]</a>with many fathers and neoterics, have written just
volumes, <span lang="la">De amore Dei</span>, as they term it, many paraenetical discourses;
another from his creatures; there is a beauty of the body, a beauty of the
soul, a beauty from virtue, <span lang="la">formam martyrum</span>, Austin calls it, <span lang="la">quam
videmus oculis animi</span>, which we see with the eyes of our mind; which
beauty, as Tully saith, if we could discern with these corporeal eyes,
<span lang="la">admirabili sui amores excitaret</span>, would cause admirable affections, and
ravish our souls. This other beauty which ariseth from those extreme parts,
and graces which proceed from gestures, speeches, several motions, and
proportions of creatures, men and women (especially from women, which made
those old poets put the three graces still in Venus' company, as attending
on her, and holding up her train) are infinite almost, and vary their names
with their objects, as love of money, covetousness, love of beauty, lust,
immoderate desire of any pleasure, concupiscence, friendship, love,
goodwill, &amp;c. and is either virtue or vice, honest, dishonest, in excess,
defect, as shall be showed in his place. Heroical love, religious love, &amp;c.
which may be reduced to a twofold division, according to the principal
parts which are affected, the brain and liver. <span lang="la">Amor et amicitia</span>, which
Scaliger <span class="cite">exercitat. 301.</span> Valesius and Melancthon warrant out of Plato
<span lang="gr">&Phi;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&nu;</span> and <span lang="gr">&#x1F10;&rho;&#x1FB6;&nu;</span> from that speech of Pausanias belike,
that makes two Veneres and two loves. <a href="#note4481">[4481]</a><q>One Venus is ancient without
a mother, and descended from heaven, whom we call celestial; the younger,
begotten of Jupiter and Dione, whom commonly we call Venus.</q> Ficinus, in
his comment upon this place, <span class="cite">cap. 8.</span> following Plato, calls these two
loves, two devils, <a href="#note4482">[4482]</a>or good and bad angels according to us, which are
still hovering about our souls. <a href="#note4483">[4483]</a><q>The one rears to heaven, the other
depresseth us to hell; the one good, which stirs us up to the contemplation
of that divine beauty for whose sake we perform justice and all godly
offices, study philosophy, &amp;c.; the other base, and though bad yet to be
respected; for indeed both are good in their own natures: procreation of
children is as necessary as that finding out of truth, but therefore called
bad, because it is abused, and withdraws our souls from the speculation of
that other to viler objects,</q> so far Ficinus. S. Austin, <span class="cite">lib. 15. de civ.
Dei et sup. Psal. lxiv.</span>, hath delivered as much in effect. <a href="#note4484">[4484]</a><q>Every
creature is good, and may be loved well or ill:</q> and <a href="#note4485">[4485]</a><q>Two cities
make two loves, Jerusalem and Babylon, the love of God the one, the love of
the world the other; of these two cities we all are citizens, as by
examination of ourselves we may soon find, and of which.</q> The one love is
the root of all mischief, the other of all good. So, in his <span class="cite">15. cap. lib.
de amor. Ecclesiae</span>, he will have those four cardinal virtues to be nought
else but love rightly composed; in his 15. book <span class="cite">de civ. Dei, cap. 22.</span> he
calls virtue the order of love, whom Thomas following <span class="cite">1. part. 2. quaest.
55. art. 1.</span> and <span class="cite">quaest. 56. 3. quaest. 62. art. 2.</span> confirms as much, and
amplifies in many words. <a href="#note4486">[4486]</a>Lucian, to the same purpose, hath a
division of his own, <q>One love was born in the sea, which is as various and
raging in young men's breasts as the sea itself, and causeth burning lust:
the other is that golden chain which was let down from heaven, and with a
divine fury ravisheth our souls, made to the image of God, and stirs us up
to comprehend the innate and incorruptible beauty to which we were once
created.</q> Beroaldus hath expressed all this in an epigram of his:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">Dogmata divini memorant si vera Platonis,</div>
<div class="line">Sunt geminae Veneres, et geminatus amor.</div>
</div>
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">Coelestis Venus est nullo generata parente,</div>
<div class="line">Quae casto sanctos nectit amore viros.</div>
</div>
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">Altera sed Venus est totum vulgata per orbem,</div>
<div class="line">Quae divum mentes alligat, atque hominum;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Improba, seductrix, petulans, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">If divine Plato's tenets they be true,</div>
<div class="line">Two Veneres, two loves there be,</div>
<div class="line">The one from heaven, unbegotten still,</div>
<div class="line">Which knits our souls in unity.</div>
<div class="line">The other famous over all the world,</div>
<div class="line">Binding the hearts of gods and men;</div>
<div class="line">Dishonest, wanton, and seducing she,</div>
<div class="line">Rules whom she will, both where and when.</div>
</div>
<p>This twofold division of love, Origen likewise follows, in his Comment on
the Canticles, one from God, the other from the devil, as he holds
(understanding it in the worse sense) which many others repeat and imitate.
Both which (to omit all subdivisions) in excess or defect, as they are
abused, or degenerate, cause melancholy in a particular kind, as shall be
shown in his place. Austin, in another Tract, makes a threefold division of
this love, which we may use well or ill: <a href="#note4487">[4487]</a><q>God, our neighbour, and
the world: God above us, our neighbour next us, the world beneath us. In
the course of our desires, God hath three things, the world one, our
neighbour two. Our desire to God, is either from God, with God, or to God,
and ordinarily so runs. From God, when it receives from him, whence, and
for which it should love him: with God, when it contradicts his will in
nothing: to God, when it seeks to him, and rests itself in him. Our love to
our neighbour may proceed from him, and run with him, not to him: from him,
as when we rejoice of his good safety, and well doing: with him, when we
desire to have him a fellow and companion of our journey in the way of the
Lord: not in him, because there is no aid, hope, or confidence in man. From
the world our love comes, when we begin to admire the Creator in his works,
and glorify God in his creatures: with the world it should run, if,
according to the mutability of all temporalities, it should be dejected in
adversity, or over elevated in prosperity: to the world, if it would settle
itself in its vain delights and studies.</q> Many such partitions of love I
could repeat, and subdivisions, but least (which Scaliger objects to
Cardan, <span class="cite">Exercitat. 501.</span>) <a href="#note4488">[4488]</a><q>I confound filthy burning lust with pure
and divine love,</q> I will follow that accurate division of Leon Hebreus,
dial. 2. betwixt Sophia and Philo, where he speaks of natural, sensible,
and rational love, and handleth each apart. Natural love or hatred, is that
sympathy or antipathy which is to be seen in animate and inanimate
creatures, in the four elements, metals, stones, <span lang="la">gravia tendunt deorsum</span>,
as a stone to his centre, fire upward, and rivers to the sea. The sun,
moon, and stars go still around, <a href="#note4489">[4489]</a><span lang="la">Amantes naturae, debita exercere</span>,
for love of perfection. This love is manifest, I say, in inanimate
creatures. How comes a loadstone to draw iron to it? jet chaff? the ground
to covet showers, but for love? No creature, S. Hierom concludes, is to be
found, <span lang="la">quod non aliquid amat</span>, no stock, no stone, that hath not some
feeling of love, 'Tis more eminent in plants, herbs, and is especially
observed in vegetables; as between the vine and elm a great sympathy,
between the vine and the cabbage, between the vine and the olive, <a href="#note4490">[4490]</a>
<span lang="la">Virgo fugit Bromium</span>, between the vine and bays a great antipathy, the
vine loves not the bay, <a href="#note4491">[4491]</a><q>nor his smell, and will kill him, if he
grow near him;</q> the bur and the lentil cannot endure one another, the olive
<a href="#note4492">[4492]</a>and the myrtle embrace each other, in roots and branches if they
grow near. Read more of this in Picolomineus <span class="cite">grad. 7. cap. 1.</span>

plant. dodio et element. sym.</span> Fracastorius <span class="cite">de sym. et antip.</span> of the love
and hatred of planets, consult with every astrologer. Leon Hebreus gives
many fabulous reasons, and moraliseth them withal.

<p>Sensible love is that of brute beasts, of which the same Leon Hebreus
<span class="cite">dial. 2.</span> assigns these causes. First for the pleasure they take in the
act of generation, male and female love one another. Secondly, for the
preservation of the species, and desire of young brood. Thirdly, for the
mutual agreement, as being of the same kind: <span lang="la">Sus sui, canis cani, bos
bovi, et asinus asino pulcherrimus videtur</span>, as Epicharmus held, and
according to that adage of Diogenianus, <span lang="la">Adsidet usque graculus apud
graculum</span>, they much delight in one another's company, <a href="#note4493">[4493]</a><span lang="la">Formicae
grata est formica, cicada cicadae</span>, and birds of a feather will gather
together. Fourthly, for custom, use, and familiarity, as if a dog be
trained up with a lion and a bear, contrary to their natures, they will
love each other. Hawks, dogs, horses, love their masters and keepers: many
stories I could relate in this kind, but see Gillius <span class="cite">de hist. anim. lib.
3. cap. 14.</span> those two Epistles of Lipsius, of dogs and horses, Agellius,
&amp;c. Fifthly, for bringing up, as if a bitch bring up a kid, a hen
ducklings, a hedge-sparrow a cuckoo, &amp;c.

<p>The third kind is <span lang="la">Amor cognitionis</span>, as Leon calls it, rational love,
<span lang="la">Intellectivus amor</span>, and is proper to men, on which I must insist. This
appears in God, angels, men. God is love itself, the fountain of love, the
disciple of love, as Plato styles him; the servant of peace, the God of
love and peace; have peace with all men and God is with you.

Hosea xiv. 5. speaks, and dearly respects, <a href="#note4500">[4500]</a><span lang="la">Charior est ipsis homo

we are most vile and base; but out of His incomparable love and goodness,
out of His Divine Nature. And this is that Homer's golden chain, which
reacheth down from heaven to earth, by which every creature is annexed, and
depends on his Creator. He made all, saith <a href="#note4501">[4501]</a>Moses, <q>and it was good;</q>
He loves it as good.

<p>The love of angels and living souls is mutual amongst themselves, towards
us militant in the church, and all such as love God; as the sunbeams

reflect on us, <a href="#note4502">[4502]</a><span lang="la">in salute hominum promovenda alacres, et constantes

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.1.2.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Love of Men, which varies as his Objects, Profitable, Pleasant, Honest</i>.</h4>

<p>Valesius, <span class="cite">lib. 3. contr. 13</span>, defines this love which is in men, <q>to be
<a href="#note4505">[4505]</a>an affection of both powers, appetite and reason.</q> The rational
resides in the brain, the other in the liver (as before hath been said out
of Plato and others); the heart is diversely affected of both, and carried
a thousand ways by consent. The sensitive faculty most part overrules
reason, the soul is carried hoodwinked, and the understanding captive like
a beast. <a href="#note4506">[4506]</a><q>The heart is variously inclined, sometimes they are merry,
sometimes sad, and from love arise hope and fear, jealousy, fury,
desperation.</q> Now this love of men is diverse, and varies, as the object
varies, by which they are enticed, as virtue, wisdom, eloquence, profit,
wealth, money, fame, honour, or comeliness of person, &amp;c. Leon Hubreus, in
his first dialogue, reduceth them all to these three, <span lang="la">utile, jucundum,
honestum</span>, profitable, pleasant, honest; (out of Aristotle belike
<span class="cite">8. moral.</span>) of which he discourseth at large, and whatsoever is beautiful and
fair, is referred to them, or any way to be desired. <a href="#note4507">[4507]</a><q>To profitable
is ascribed health, wealth, honour, &amp;c., which is rather ambition, desire,
covetousness, than love:</q> friends, children, love of women, <a href="#note4508">[4508]</a>all
delightful and pleasant objects, are referred to the second. The love of
honest things consists in virtue and wisdom, and is preferred before that
which is profitable and pleasant: intellectual, about that which is honest.
<a href="#note4509">[4509]</a>St. Austin calls <q>profitable, worldly; pleasant, carnal; honest,
spiritual. <a href="#note4510">[4510]</a>Of and from all three, result charity, friendship, and
true love, which respects God and our neighbour.</q> Of each of these I will
briefly dilate, and show in what sort they cause melancholy.

<p>Amongst all these fair enticing objects, which procure love, and bewitch
the soul of man, there is none so moving, so forcible as profit; and that
which carrieth with it a show of commodity. Health indeed is a precious
thing, to recover and preserve which we will undergo any misery, drink
bitter potions, freely give our goods: restore a man to his health, his
purse lies open to thee, bountiful he is, thankful and beholding to thee;
but give him wealth and honour, give him gold, or what shall be for his
advantage and preferment, and thou shalt command his affections, oblige him
eternally to thee, heart, hand, life, and all is at thy service, thou art
his dear and loving friend, good and gracious lord and master, his Mecaenas;
he is thy slave, thy vassal, most devote, affectioned, and bound in all
duty: tell him good tidings in this kind, there spoke an angel, a blessed
hour that brings in gain, he is thy creature, and thou his creator, he hugs
and admires thee; he is thine for ever. No loadstone so attractive as that
of profit, none so fair an object as this of gold; <a href="#note4511">[4511]</a>nothing wins a
man sooner than a good turn, bounty and liberality command body and soul:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">Munera (crede mihi) placant hominesque deosque;</div>
<div class="line">Placatur donis Jupiter ipse datis.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Good turns doth pacify both God and men,</div>
<div class="line">And Jupiter himself is won by them.</div>
</div>
<p>Gold of all other is a most delicious object; a sweet light, a goodly
lustre it hath; <span lang="la">gratius aurum quam solem intuemur</span>, saith Austin, and we
had rather see it than the sun. Sweet and pleasant in getting, in keeping;
it seasons all our labours, intolerable pains we take for it, base
employments, endure bitter flouts and taunts, long journeys, heavy burdens,
all are made light and easy by this hope of gain: <span lang="la">At mihi plaudo ipse
domi, simul ac nummos contemplor in arca</span>. The sight of gold refresheth our
spirits, and ravisheth our hearts, as that Babylonian garment and <a href="#note4512">[4512]</a>
golden wedge did Achan in the camp, the very sight and hearing sets on fire
his soul with desire of it. It will make a man run to the antipodes, or
tarry at home and turn parasite, lie, flatter, prostitute himself, swear
and bear false witness; he will venture his body, kill a king, murder his
father, and damn his soul to come at it. <span lang="la">Formosior auri massa</span>, as <a href="#note4513">[4513]</a>
he well observed, the mass of gold is fairer than all your Grecian
pictures, that Apelles, Phidias, or any doting painter could ever make: we
are enamoured with it,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4514">[4514]</a>Prima fere vota, et cunctis notissima templis,</div>
<div class="line">Divitiae ut crescant.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
All our labours, studies, endeavours, vows, prayers and wishes, are to get,
how to compass it.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4515">[4515]</a>Haec est illa cui famulatur maximus orbis,</div>
<div class="line">Diva potens rerum, domitrixque pecunia fati.</div>
</div>
<q>This is the great goddess we adore and worship; this is the sole object of
our desire.</q> If we have it, as we think, we are made for ever, thrice
happy, princes, lords, &amp;c. If we lose it, we are dull, heavy, dejected,
discontent, miserable, desperate, and mad. Our estate and <span lang="la">bene esse</span> ebbs
and flows with our commodity; and as we are endowed or enriched, so are we
beloved and esteemed: it lasts no longer than our wealth; when that is
gone, and the object removed, farewell friendship: as long as bounty, good
cheer, and rewards were to be hoped, friends enough; they were tied to thee
by the teeth, and would follow thee as crows do a carcass: but when thy
goods are gone and spent, the lamp of their love is out, and thou shalt be
contemned, scorned, hated, injured. <a href="#note4516">[4516]</a>Lucian's Timon, when he lived in
prosperity, was the sole spectacle of Greece, only admired; who but Timon?
Everybody loved, honoured, applauded him, each man offered him his service,
and sought to be kin to him; but when his gold was spent, his fair
possessions gone, farewell Timon: none so ugly, none so deformed, so odious
an object as Timon, no man so ridiculous on a sudden, they gave him a penny
to buy a rope, no man would know him.

<p>'Tis the general humour of the world, commodity steers our affections
throughout, we love those that are fortunate and rich, that thrive, or by
whom we may receive mutual kindness, hope for like courtesies, get any
good, gain, or profit; hate those, and abhor on the other side, which are
poor and miserable, or by whom we may sustain loss or inconvenience. And
even those that were now familiar and dear unto us, our loving and long
friends, neighbours, kinsmen, allies, with whom we have conversed, and
lived as so many Geryons for some years past, striving still to give one
another all good content and entertainment, with mutual invitations,
feastings, disports, offices, for whom we would ride, run, spend ourselves,
and of whom we have so freely and honourably spoken, to whom we have given
all those turgent titles, and magnificent eulogiums, most excellent and
most noble, worthy, wise, grave, learned, valiant, &amp;c., and magnified
beyond measure: if any controversy arise between us, some trespass, injury,
abuse, some part of our goods be detained, a piece of land come to be
litigious, if they cross us in our suit, or touch the string of our
commodity, we detest and depress them upon a sudden: neither affinity,
consanguinity, or old acquaintance can contain us, but <a href="#note4517">[4517]</a><span lang="la">rupto jecore
exierit Caprificus</span>. A golden apple sets altogether by the ears, as if a
marrowbone or honeycomb were flung amongst bears: father and son, brother
and sister, kinsmen are at odds: and look what malice, deadly hatred can
invent, that shall be done, <span lang="la">Terrible, dirum, pestilens, atrox, ferum</span>,
mutual injuries, desire of revenge, and how to hurt them, him and his, are
all our studies. If our pleasures be interrupt, we can tolerate it: our
bodies hurt, we can put it up and be reconciled: but touch our commodities,
we are most impatient: fair becomes foul, the graces are turned to harpies,
friendly salutations to bitter imprecations, mutual feastings to plotting
villainies, minings and counterminings; good words to satires and
invectives, we revile <span lang="la">e contra</span>, nought but his imperfections are in our
eyes, he is a base knave, a devil, a monster, a caterpillar, a viper, a
hog-rubber, &amp;c. <span lang="la">Desinit in piscem mulier formosa superne</span>;<a href="#note4518">[4518]</a> the scene
is altered on a sudden, love is turned to hate, mirth to melancholy: so
furiously are we most part bent, our affections fixed upon this object of
commodity, and upon money, the desire of which in excess is covetousness:
ambition tyranniseth over our souls, as <a href="#note4519">[4519]</a>I have shown, and in defect
crucifies as much, as if a man by negligence, ill husbandry, improvidence,
prodigality, waste and consume his goods and fortunes, beggary follows, and
melancholy, he becomes an abject, <a href="#note4520">[4520]</a>odious and <q>worse than an infidel,
in not providing for his family.</q>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.1.2.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Pleasant Objects of Love</i>.</h4>

<p>Pleasant objects are infinite, whether they be such as have life, or be
without life; inanimate are countries, provinces, towers, towns, cities, as
he said, <a href="#note4521">[4521]</a><span lang="la">Pulcherrimam insulam videmus, etiam cum non videmus</span> we
see a fair island by description, when we see it not. The <a href="#note4522">[4522]</a>sun never
saw a fairer city, Thessala Tempe, orchards, gardens, pleasant walks,
groves, fountains, &amp;c. The heaven itself is said to be <a href="#note4523">[4523]</a>fair or foul:
fair buildings, <a href="#note4524">[4524]</a>fair pictures, all artificial, elaborate and curious
works, clothes, give an admirable lustre: we admire, and gaze upon them,
<span lang="la">ut pueri Junonis avem</span>, as children do on a peacock: a fair dog, a fair
horse and hawk, &amp;c. <a href="#note4525">[4525]</a><span lang="la">Thessalus amat equum pullinum, buculum
Aegyptius, Lacedaemonius Catulum</span>, &amp;c., such things we love, are most
gracious in our sight, acceptable unto us, and whatsoever else may cause
this passion, if it be superfluous or immoderately loved, as Guianerius
observes. These things in themselves are pleasing and good, singular
ornaments, necessary, comely, and fit to be had; but when we fix an
immoderate eye, and dote on them over much, this pleasure may turn to pain,
bring much sorrow and discontent unto us, work our final overthrow, and
cause melancholy in the end. Many are carried away with those bewitching
sports of gaming, hawking, hunting, and such vain pleasures, as <a href="#note4526">[4526]</a>I
have said: some with immoderate desire of fame, to be crowned in the
Olympics, knighted in the field, &amp;c., and by these means ruinate
themselves. The lascivious dotes on his fair mistress, the glutton on his
dishes, which are infinitely varied to please the palate, the epicure on
his several pleasures, the superstitious on his idol, and fats himself with
future joys, as Turks feed themselves with an imaginary persuasion of a
sensual paradise: so several pleasant objects diversely affect diverse men.
But the fairest objects and enticings proceed from men themselves, which
most frequently captivate, allure, and make them dote beyond all measure
upon one another, and that for many respects: first, as some suppose, by
that secret force of stars, (<span lang="la">quod me tibi temperat astrum</span>?) They do
singularly dote on such a man, hate such again, and can give no reason for
it. <a href="#note4527">[4527]</a><span lang="la">Non amo te Sabidi</span>, &amp;c. Alexander admired Ephestion, Adrian
Antinous, Nero Sporus, &amp;c. The physicians refer this to their temperament,
astrologers to trine and sextile aspects, or opposite of their several
ascendants, lords of their genitures, love and hatred of planets; <a href="#note4528">[4528]</a>
Cicogna, to concord and discord of spirits; but most to outward graces. A
merry companion is welcome and acceptable to all men, and therefore, saith
<a href="#note4529">[4529]</a>Gomesius, princes and great men entertain jesters and players
commonly in their courts. But <a href="#note4530">[4530]</a><span lang="la">Pares cum paribus facillime
congregantur</span>, 'tis that <a href="#note4531">[4531]</a>similitude of manners, which ties most men
in an inseparable link, as if they be addicted to the same studies or
disports, they delight in one another's companies, <q>birds of a feather will
gather together:</q> if they be of divers inclinations, or opposite in
manners, they can seldom agree. Secondly, <a href="#note4532">[4532]</a>affability, custom, and
familiarity, may convert nature many times, though they be different in
manners, as if they be countrymen, fellow-students, colleagues, or have
been fellow-soldiers, <a href="#note4533">[4533]</a>brethren in affliction, (<a href="#note4534">[4534]</a><span lang="la">acerba
calamitatum societas, diversi etiam ingenii homines conjungit</span>) affinity,
or some such accidental occasion, though they cannot agree amongst
themselves, they will stick together like burrs, and bold against a third;
so after some discontinuance, or death, enmity ceaseth; or in a foreign
place:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Pascitur in vivis livor, post fata quiescit:</div>
<div class="line">Et cecidere odia, et tristes mors obruit iras.</div>
</div>
A third cause of love and hate, may be mutual offices, <span lang="la">acceptum
beneficium</span>, <a href="#note4535">[4535]</a>commend him, use him kindly, take his part in a
quarrel, relieve him in his misery, thou winnest him for ever; do the
opposite, and be sure of a perpetual enemy. Praise and dispraise of each
other, do as much, though unknown, as <a href="#note4536">[4536]</a>Schoppius by Scaliger and
Casaubonus: <span lang="la">mulus mulum scabit</span>; who but Scaliger with him? what
encomiums, epithets, eulogiums? <span lang="la">Antistes sapientiae, perpetuus dictator,
literarum ornamentum, Europae miraculum</span>, noble Scaliger, <a href="#note4537">[4537]</a>
<span lang="la">incredibilis ingenii praestantia, &amp;c., diis potius quam hominibus per
omnia comparandus, scripta ejus aurea ancylia de coelo delapsa poplitibus
veneramur flexis</span>, &amp;c.,<a href="#note4538">[4538]</a> but when they began to vary, none so absurd
as Scaliger, so vile and base, as his books <span class="cite">de Burdonum familia</span>, and other
satirical invectives may witness, Ovid, <span class="cite">in Ibin</span>, Archilocus himself was
not so bitter. Another great tie or cause of love, is consanguinity:
parents are clear to their children, children to their parents, brothers
and sisters, cousins of all sorts, as a hen and chickens, all of a knot:
every crow thinks her own bird fairest. Many memorable examples are in this
kind, and 'tis <span lang="la">portenti simile</span>, if they do not: <a href="#note4539">[4539]</a><q>a mother cannot
forget her child:</q> Solomon so found out the true owner; love of parents may
not be concealed, 'tis natural, descends, and they that are inhuman in this
kind, are unworthy of that air they breathe, and of the four elements; yet
many unnatural examples we have in this rank, of hard-hearted parents,
disobedient children, of <a href="#note4540">[4540]</a>disagreeing brothers, nothing so common.
The love of kinsmen is grown cold, <a href="#note4541">[4541]</a><q>many kinsmen</q> (as the saying is)
<q>few friends;</q> if thine estate be good, and thou able, <span lang="la">par pari referre</span>,
to requite their kindness, there will be mutual correspondence, otherwise
thou art a burden, most odious to them above all others. The last object
that ties man and man, is comeliness of person, and beauty alone, as men
love women with a wanton eye: which <span lang="gr">&kappa;&alpha;&tau;' &#x1F10;&xi;&omicron;&chi;&#x1F74;&nu;</span> is termed
heroical, or love-melancholy. Other loves (saith Picolomineus) are so
called with some contraction, as the love of wine, gold, &amp;c., but this of
women is predominant in a higher strain, whose part affected is the liver,
and this love deserves a longer explication, and shall be dilated apart in
the next section.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.1.2.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Honest Objects of Love</i>.</h4>

<p>Beauty is the common object of all love, <a href="#note4542">[4542]</a><q>as jet draws a straw, so
doth beauty love:</q> virtue and honesty are great motives, and give as fair a
lustre as the rest, especially if they be sincere and right, not fucate,
but proceeding from true form, and an incorrupt judgment; those two Venus'
twins, Eros and Anteros, are then most firm and fast. For many times
otherwise men are deceived by their flattering gnathos, dissembling
camelions, outsides, hypocrites that make a show of great love, learning,
pretend honesty, virtue, zeal, modesty, with affected looks and counterfeit
gestures: feigned protestations often steal away the hearts and favours of
men, and deceive them, <span lang="la">specie virtutis et umbra</span>, when as <span lang="la">revera</span> and
indeed, there is no worth or honesty at all in them, no truth, but mere
hypocrisy, subtlety, knavery, and the like. As true friends they are, as he
that Caelius Secundus met by the highway side; and hard it is in this
temporising age to distinguish such companions, or to find them out. Such
gnathos as these for the most part belong to great men, and by this glozing
flattery, affability, and such like philters, so dive and insinuate into
their favours, that they are taken for men of excellent worth, wisdom,
learning, demigods, and so screw themselves into dignities, honours,
offices; but these men cause harsh confusion often, and as many times stirs
as Rehoboam's counsellors in a commonwealth, overthrew themselves and
others. Tandlerus and some authors make a doubt, whether love and hatred
may be compelled by philters or characters; Cardan and Marbodius, by
precious stones and amulets; astrologers by election of times, &amp;c. as
<a href="#note4543">[4543]</a>I shall elsewhere discuss. The true object of this honest love is
virtue, wisdom, honesty, <a href="#note4544">[4544]</a>real worth, <span lang="la">Interna forma</span>, and this love
cannot deceive or be compelled, <span lang="la">ut ameris amabilis esto</span>, love itself is
the most potent philtrum, virtue and wisdom, <span lang="la">gratia gratum faciens</span>, the
sole and only grace, not counterfeit, but open, honest, simple, naked,
<a href="#note4545">[4545]</a><q>descending from heaven,</q> as our apostle hath it, an infused habit
from God, which hath given several gifts, as wit, learning, tongues, for
which they shall be amiable and gracious, <span class="bibcite">Eph. iv. 11.</span> as to Saul stature and
a goodly presence, <span class="bibcite">1 Sam. ix. 1.</span> Joseph found favour in Pharaoh's court,
<span class="bibcite">Gen. xxxix</span>, for <a href="#note4546">[4546]</a>his person; and Daniel with the princes of the
eunuchs, <span class="bibcite">Dan. xix. 19.</span> Christ was gracious with God and men, <span class="bibcite">Luke ii. 52.</span>
There is still some peculiar grace, as of good discourse, eloquence, wit,
honesty, which is the <span lang="la">primum mobile</span>, first mover, and a most forcible
loadstone to draw the favours and good wills of men's eyes, ears, and
affections unto them. When <q>Jesus spake, they were all astonished at his
answers,</q> (<span class="bibcite">Luke ii. 47.</span>) <q>and wondered at his gracious words which proceeded
from his mouth.</q> An orator steals away the hearts of men, and as another
Orpheus, <span lang="la">quo vult, unde vult</span>, he pulls them to him by speech alone: a
sweet voice causeth admiration; and he that can utter himself in good
words, in our ordinary phrase, is called a proper man, a divine spirit. For
which cause belike, our old poets, <span lang="la">Senatus populusque poetarum</span>, made
Mercury the gentleman-usher to the Graces, captain of eloquence, and those
charities to be Jupiter's and Eurymone's daughters, descended from above.
Though they be otherwise deformed, crooked, ugly to behold, those good
parts of the mind denominate them fair. Plato commends the beauty of
Socrates; yet who was more grim of countenance, stern and ghastly to look
upon? So are and have been many great philosophers, as <a href="#note4547">[4547]</a>Gregory
Nazianzen observes, <q>deformed most part in that which is to be seen with
the eyes, but most elegant in that which is not to be seen.</q> <span lang="la">Saepe sub
attrita latitat sapientia veste</span>. Aesop, Democritus, Aristotle, Politianus,
Melancthon, Gesner, &amp;c. withered old men, <span lang="la">Sileni Alcibiadis</span>, very harsh
and impolite to the eye; but who were so terse, polite, eloquent, generally
learned, temperate and modest? No man then living was so fair as
Alcibiades, so lovely <span lang="la">quo ad superficiem</span>, to the eye, as <a href="#note4548">[4548]</a>Boethius
observes, but he had <span lang="la">Corpus turpissimum interne</span>, a most deformed soul;
honesty, virtue, fair conditions, are great enticers to such as are well
given, and much avail to get the favour and goodwill of men. Abdolominus
in Curtius, a poor man, (but which mine author notes, <a href="#note4549">[4549]</a><q>the cause of
this poverty was his honesty</q>) for his modesty and continency from a
private person (for they found him digging in his garden) was saluted king,
and preferred before all the magnificoes of his time, <span lang="la">injecta ei vestis
purpura auroque distincta</span>, <q>a purple embroidered garment was put upon him,
<a href="#note4550">[4550]</a>and they bade him wash himself, and, as he was worthy, take upon him
the style and spirit of a king,</q> continue his continency and the rest of
his good parts. Titus Pomponius Atticus, that noble citizen of Rome, was so
fair conditioned, of so sweet a carriage, that he was generally beloved of
all good men, of Caesar, Pompey, Antony, Tully, of divers sects, &amp;c.
<span lang="la">multas haereditates</span> (<a href="#note4551">[4551]</a>Cornelius Nepos writes) <span lang="la">sola bonitate
consequutus. Operae, pretium audire</span>, &amp;c. It is worthy of your attention,
Livy cries, <a href="#note4552">[4552]</a><q>you that scorn all but riches, and give no esteem to
virtue, except they be wealthy withal, Q. Cincinnatus had but four acres,
and by the consent of the senate was chosen dictator of Rome.</q> Of such
account were Cato, Fabricius, Aristides, Antonius, Probus, for their
eminent worth: so Caesar, Trajan, Alexander, admired for valour, <a href="#note4553">[4553]</a>
Haephestion loved Alexander, but Parmenio the king: <span lang="la">Titus deliciae humani
generis</span>, and which Aurelius Victor hath of Vespasian, the darling of his
time, as <a href="#note4554">[4554]</a>Edgar Etheling was in England, for his <a href="#note4555">[4555]</a>excellent
virtues: their memory is yet fresh, sweet, and we love them many ages
after, though they be dead: <span lang="la">Suavem memoriam sui reliquit</span>, saith Lipsius
of his friend, living and dead they are all one. <a href="#note4556">[4556]</a><q>I have ever loved
as thou knowest</q> (so Tully wrote to Dolabella) <q>Marcus Brutus for his great
wit, singular honesty, constancy, sweet conditions; and believe it</q> <a href="#note4557">[4557]</a>
<q>there is nothing so amiable and fair as virtue.</q> <q>I <a href="#note4558">[4558]</a>do mightily love
Calvisinus,</q> (so Pliny writes to Sossius) <q>a most industrious, eloquent,
upright man, which is all in all with me:</q> the affection came from his good
parts. And as St. Austin comments on the 84th Psalm, <a href="#note4559">[4559]</a><q>there is a
peculiar beauty of justice, and inward beauty, which we see with the eyes
of our hearts, love, and are enamoured with, as in martyrs, though their
bodies be torn in pieces with wild beasts, yet this beauty shines, and we
love their virtues.</q> The <a href="#note4560">[4560]</a>stoics are of opinion that a wise man is
only fair; and Cato in Tully <span class="cite">3 de Finibus</span> contends the same, that the
lineaments of the mind are far fairer than those of the body, incomparably
beyond them: wisdom and valour according to <a href="#note4561">[4561]</a>Xenophon, especially
deserve the name of beauty, and denominate one fair, <span lang="la">et incomparabiliter
pulchrior est</span> (as Austin holds) <span lang="la">veritas Christianorum quam Helena
Graecorum</span>. <q>Wine is strong, the king is strong, women are strong, but
truth overcometh all things,</q> <span class="bibcite">Esd. i. 3, 10, 11, 12.</span> <q>Blessed is the man
that findeth wisdom, and getteth understanding, for the merchandise thereof
is better than silver, and the gain thereof better than gold: it is more
precious than pearls, and all the things thou canst desire are not to be
compared to her,</q> <span class="bibcite">Prov. ii. 13, 14, 15</span>, a wise, true, just, upright, and
good man, I say it again, is only fair: <a href="#note4562">[4562]</a>it is reported of Magdalene
Queen of France, and wife to Lewis 11th, a Scottish woman by birth, that
walking forth in an evening with her ladies, she spied M. Alanus, one of
the king's chaplains, a silly, old, <a href="#note4563">[4563]</a>hard-favoured man fast asleep in
a bower, and kissed him sweetly; when the young ladies laughed at her for
it, she replied, that it was not his person that she did embrace and
reverence, but, with a platonic love, the divine beauty of <a href="#note4564">[4564]</a>his soul.
Thus in all ages virtue hath been adored, admired, a singular lustre hath
proceeded from it: and the more virtuous he is, the more gracious, the more
admired. No man so much followed upon earth as Christ himself: and as the
Psalmist saith, <span class="bibcite">xlv. 2</span>, <q>He was fairer than the sons of men.</q> Chrysostom
<span class="cite">Hom. 8 in Mat.</span> Bernard <span class="cite">Ser. 1. de omnibus sanctis</span>; Austin,
Cassiodore, <span class="cite">Hier. in 9 Mat.</span> interpret it of the <a href="#note4565">[4565]</a>beauty of his
person; there was a divine majesty in his looks, it shined like lightning
and drew all men to it: but Basil, <span class="cite">Cyril, lib. 6. super. 55. Esay.</span>
Theodoret, Arnobius, &amp;c. of the beauty of his divinity, justice, grace,
eloquence, &amp;c. Thomas <span class="cite">in Psal. xliv.</span> of both; and so doth Baradius and
Peter Morales, <span class="cite">lib de pulchritud. Jesu et Mariae</span>, adding as much of Joseph
and the Virgin Mary,&mdash;<span lang="la">haec alias forma praecesserit omnes</span>, <a href="#note4566">[4566]</a>according
to that prediction of Sibylla Cumea. Be they present or absent, near us, or
afar off, this beauty shines, and will attract men many miles to come and
visit it. Plato and Pythagoras left their country, to see those wise
Egyptian priests: Apollonius travelled into Ethiopia, Persia, to consult
with the Magi, Brachmanni, gymnosophists. The Queen of Sheba came to visit
Solomon; and <q>many,</q> saith <a href="#note4567">[4567]</a>Hierom, <q>went out of Spain and remote
places a thousand miles, to behold that eloquent Livy:</q> <a href="#note4568">[4568]</a><span lang="la">Multi Romam
non ut urbem pulcherrimam, aut urbis et orbis dominum Octavianum, sed ut
hunc unum inviserent audirentque, a Gadibus profecti sunt.</span> No beauty
leaves such an impression, strikes so deep <a href="#note4569">[4569]</a>, or links the souls of
men closer than virtue.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4570">[4570]</a>Non per deos aut pictor posset,</div>
<div class="line">Aut statuarius ullus fingere</div>
<div class="line">Talem pulchritudinem qualem virtus habet;</div>
</div>
<q>no painter, no graver, no carver can express virtue's lustre, or those
admirable rays that come from it, those enchanting rays that enamour
posterity, those everlasting rays that continue to the world's end.</q> Many,
saith Phavorinus, that loved and admired Alcibiades in his youth, knew not,
cared not for Alcibiades a man, <span lang="la">nunc intuentes quaerebant Alcibiadem</span>; but
the beauty of Socrates is still the same; <a href="#note4571">[4571]</a>virtue's lustre never
fades, is ever fresh and green, <span lang="la">semper viva</span> to all succeeding ages, and a
most attractive loadstone, to draw and combine such as are present. For
that reason belike, Homer feigns the three Graces to be linked and tied
hand in hand, because the hearts of men are so firmly united with such
graces. <a href="#note4572">[4572]</a><q>O sweet bands (Seneca exclaims), which so happily combine,
that those which are bound by them love their binders, desiring withal much
more harder to be bound,</q> and as so many Geryons to be united into one. For
the nature of true friendship is to combine, to be like affected, of one
mind,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4573">[4573]</a>Velle et nolle ambobus idem, satiataque toto</div>
<div class="line">Mens aevo&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
as the poet saith, still to continue one and the same. And where this love
takes place there is peace and quietness, a true correspondence, perfect
amity, a diapason of vows and wishes, the same opinions, as between <a href="#note4574">[4574]</a>
David and Jonathan, Damon and Pythias, Pylades and Orestes, <a href="#note4575">[4575]</a>Nysus
and Euryalus, Theseus and Pirithous, <a href="#note4576">[4576]</a>they will live and die
together, and prosecute one another with good turns. <a href="#note4577">[4577]</a><span lang="la">Nam vinci in
amore turpissimum putant</span>, not only living, but when their friends are
dead, with tombs and monuments, nenias, epitaphs elegies, inscriptions,
pyramids, obelisks, statues, images, pictures, histories, poems, annals,
feasts, anniversaries, many ages after (as Plato's scholars did) they will
<span lang="la">parentare</span> still, omit no good office that may tend to the preservation of
their names, honours, and eternal memory. <a href="#note4578">[4578]</a><span lang="la">Illum coloribus, illum

brass, in ivory, marble, gold, and silver</q> (as Pliny reports of a citizen in
Rome), <q>and in a great auditory not long since recited a just volume of his
life.</q> In another place, <a href="#note4579">[4579]</a>speaking of an epigram which Martial had
composed in praise of him, <a href="#note4580">[4580]</a><q>He gave me as much as he might, and
would have done more if he could: though what can a man give more than
honour, glory, and eternity?</q> But that which he wrote peradventure will not
continue, yet he wrote it to continue. 'Tis all the recompense a poor
scholar can make his well-deserving patron, Mecaenas, friend, to mention
him in his works, to dedicate a book to his name, to write his life, &amp;c.,
as all our poets, orators, historiographers have ever done, and the
greatest revenge such men take of their adversaries, to persecute them with
satires, invectives, &amp;c., and 'tis both ways of great moment, as <a href="#note4581">[4581]</a>
Plato gives us to understand. Paulus Jovius, in the fourth book of the life
and deeds of Pope Leo Decimus, his noble patron, concludes in these words,
<a href="#note4582">[4582]</a><q>Because I cannot honour him as other rich men do, with like
endeavour, affection, and piety, I have undertaken to write his life; since
my fortunes will not give me leave to make a more sumptuous monument, I
will perform those rites to his sacred ashes, which a small, perhaps, but a
liberal wit can afford.</q> But I rove. Where this true love is wanting, there
can be no firm peace, friendship from teeth outward, counterfeit, or for
some by-respects, so long dissembled, till they have satisfied their own
ends, which, upon every small occasion, breaks out into enmity, open war,
defiance, heart-burnings, whispering, calumnies, contentions, and all
manner of bitter melancholy discontents. And those men which have no other
object of their love, than greatness, wealth, authority, &amp;c., are rather
feared than beloved; <span lang="la">nec amant quemquam, nec amantur ab ullo</span>: and
howsoever borne with for a time, yet for their tyranny and oppression,
griping, covetousness, currish hardness, folly, intemperance, imprudence,
and such like vices, they are generally odious, abhorred of all, both God
and men.

<q>wife and children, friends, neighbours, all the world forsakes them, would
feign be rid of them,</q> and are compelled many times to lay violent hands on
them, or else God's judgments overtake them: instead of graces, come
furies. So when fair <a href="#note4583">[4583]</a>Abigail, a woman of singular wisdom, was

<a href="#note4584">[4584]</a>Mordecai was received, when Haman was executed, Haman the favourite,
<q>that had his seat above the other princes, to whom all the king's servants

flourished many times, such hypocrites, such temporising foxes, and blear
the world's eyes by flattery, bribery, dissembling their natures, or other
men's weakness, that cannot so apprehend their tricks, yet in the end they

<q>thou hast set them in slippery places,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psal. xxxvii. 5.</span> as so many Sejani,

down headlong on a sudden. Or put case they escape, and rest unmasked to
their lives' end, yet after their death their memory stinks as a snuff of a
candle put out, and those that durst not so much as mutter against them in
their lives, will prosecute their name with satires, libels, and bitter
imprecations, they shall <span lang="la">male audire</span> in all succeeding ages, and be

<h4><i>Charity composed of all three Kinds, Pleasant, Profitable, Honest</i>.</h4>

<p>Besides this love that comes from profit, pleasant, honest (for one good
turn asks another in equity), that which proceeds from the law of nature,
or from discipline and philosophy, there is yet another love compounded of
all these three, which is charity, and includes piety, dilection,
benevolence, friendship, even all those virtuous habits; for love is the
circle equant of all other affections, of which Aristotle dilates at large
in his Ethics, and is commanded by God, which no man can well perform, but
he that is a Christian, and a true regenerate man; this is,<a href="#note4586">[4586]</a><q>To love
God above all, and our neighbour as ourself;</q> for this love is <span lang="la">lychnus
accendens et accensus</span>, a communicating light, apt to illuminate itself as
well as others. All other objects are fair, and very beautiful, I confess;
kindred, alliance, friendship, the love that we owe to our country, nature,
wealth, pleasure, honour, and such moral respects, &amp;c., of which read
<a href="#note4587">[4587]</a>copious Aristotle in his morals; a man is beloved of a man, in that
he is a man; but all these are far more eminent and great, when they shall
proceed from a sanctified spirit, that hath a true touch of religion, and a
reference to God. Nature binds all creatures to love their young ones; a
hen to preserve her brood will run upon a lion, a hind will fight with a
bull, a sow with a bear, a silly sheep with a fox. So the same nature
urgeth a man to love his parents, (<a href="#note4588">[4588]</a><span lang="la">dii me pater omnes oderint, ni
te magis quam oculos amem meos!</span>) and this love cannot be dissolved, as
Tully holds, <a href="#note4589">[4589]</a><q>without detestable offence:</q> but much more God's
commandment, which enjoins a filial love, and an obedience in this kind.
<a href="#note4590">[4590]</a><q>The love of brethren is great, and like an arch of stones, where if
one be displaced, all comes down,</q> no love so forcible and strong, honest,
to the combination of which, nature, fortune, virtue, happily concur; yet
this love comes short of it. <a href="#note4591">[4591]</a><span lang="la">Dulce et decorum pro patria mori</span>,
<a href="#note4592">[4592]</a>it cannot be expressed, what a deal of charity that one name of
country contains. <span lang="la">Amor laudis et patriae pro stipendio est</span>; the Decii did
<span lang="la">se devovere</span>, Horatii, Curii, Scaevola, Regulus, Codrus, sacrifice
themselves for their country's peace and good.

Fifty thousand Englishmen lost their lives willingly near Battle Abbey, in

of Calais, that came with halters in their hands to the king of England, to
die for the rest. This love makes so many writers take such pains, so many
historiographers, physicians, &amp;c., or at least, as they pretend, for common
safety, and their country's benefit. <a href="#note4595">[4595]</a><span lang="la">Sanctum nomen amiciticae,
sociorum communio sacra</span>; friendship is a holy name, and a sacred communion
of friends. <a href="#note4596">[4596]</a><q>As the sun is in the firmament, so is friendship in the
world,</q> a most divine and heavenly band. As nuptial love makes, this
perfects mankind, and is to be preferred (if you will stand to the judgment
of <a href="#note4597">[4597]</a>Cornelius Nepos) before affinity or consanguinity; <span lang="la">plus in
amiciticia valet similitudo morum, quam affinitas</span>, &amp;c., the cords of love
bind faster than any other wreath whatsoever. Take this away, and take all
pleasure, joy, comfort, happiness, and true content out of the world; 'tis
the greatest tie, the surest indenture, strongest band, and, as our modern
Maro decides it, is much to be preferred before the rest.
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4598">[4598]</a>Hard is the doubt, and difficult to deem,</div>
<div class="line">When all three kinds of love together meet;</div>
<div class="line">And do dispart the heart with power extreme,</div>
<div class="line">Whether shall weigh the balance down; to wit,</div>
<div class="line">The dear affection unto kindred sweet,</div>
<div class="line">Or raging fire of love to women kind,</div>
<div class="line">Or zeal of friends, combin'd by virtues meet;</div>
<div class="line">But of them all the band of virtuous mind,</div>
<div class="line">Methinks the gentle heart should most assured bind.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">For natural affection soon doth cease,</div>
<div class="line">And quenched is with Cupid's greater flame;</div>
<div class="line">But faithful friendship doth them both suppress,</div>
<div class="line">And them with mastering discipline doth tame,</div>
<div class="line">Through thoughts aspiring to eternal fame.</div>
<div class="line">For as the soul doth rule the earthly mass,</div>
<div class="line">And all the service of the body frame,</div>
<div class="line">So love of soul doth love of body pass,</div>
<div class="line">No less than perfect gold surmounts the meanest brass.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="#note4599">[4599]</a>A faithful friend is better than <a href="#note4600">[4600]</a>gold, a medicine of misery,
<a href="#note4601">[4601]</a>an only possession; yet this love of friends, nuptial, heroical,
profitable, pleasant, honest, all three loves put together, are little
worth, if they proceed not from a true Christian illuminated soul, if it be
not done <span lang="la">in ordine ad Deum</span> for God's sake. <q>Though I had the gift of
prophecy, spake with tongues of men and angels, though I feed the poor with
all my goods, give my body to be burned, and have not this love, it
profiteth me nothing,</q> <span class="bibcite">1 Cor. xiii. 1, 3.</span> 'tis <span lang="la">splendidum peccatum</span>,
without charity. This is an all-apprehending love, a deifying love, a
refined, pure, divine love, the quintessence of all love, the true
philosopher's stone, <span lang="la">Non potest enim</span>, as <a href="#note4602">[4602]</a>Austin infers, <span lang="la">veraciter
amicus esse hominis, nisi fuerit ipsius primitus veritatis</span>, He is no true
friend that loves not God's truth. And therefore this is true love indeed,
the cause of all good to mortal men, that reconciles all creatures, and
glues them together in perpetual amity and firm league; and can no more
abide bitterness, hate, malice, than fair and foul weather, light and
darkness, sterility and plenty may be together; as the sun in the firmament
(I say), so is love in the world; and for this cause 'tis love without an
addition, love <span lang="gr">&kappa;&alpha;&tau;' &#x1F10;&xi;&omicron;&chi;&#x1F74;&nu;</span>, love of God, and love of men. <a href="#note4603">[4603]</a><q>The love of God
begets the love of man; and by this love of our neighbour, the love of God
is nourished and increased.</q> By this happy union of love, <a href="#note4604">[4604]</a><q>all
well-governed families and cities are combined, the heavens annexed, and
divine souls complicated, the world itself composed, and all that is in it
conjoined in God, and reduced to one.</q> <a href="#note4605">[4605]</a><q>This love causeth true and
absolute virtues, the life, spirit, and root of every virtuous action, it
finisheth prosperity, easeth adversity, corrects all natural encumbrances,</q>
inconveniences, sustained by faith and hope, which with this our love make
an indissoluble twist, a Gordian knot, an equilateral triangle, <q>and yet the
greatest of them is love,</q> <span class="bibcite">1 Cor. xiii. 13</span>, <a href="#note4606">[4606]</a><q>which inflames our
souls with a divine heat, and being so inflamed, purged, and so purgeth,
elevates to God, makes an atonement, and reconciles us unto him.</q> <a href="#note4607">[4607]</a>
<q>That other love infects the soul of man, this cleanseth; that depresses,
this rears; that causeth cares and troubles, this quietness of mind; this
informs, that deforms our life; that leads to repentance, this to heaven.</q>
For if once we be truly linked and touched with this charity, we shall love
God above all, our neighbour as ourself, as we are enjoined, <span class="bibcite">Mark xii. 31.</span>
<span class="bibcite">Matt. xix. 19.</span> perform those duties and exercises, even all the operations
of a good Christian.

<p><q>This love suffereth long, it is bountiful, envieth not, boasteth not
itself, is not puffed up, it deceiveth not, it seeketh not his own things,
is not provoked to anger, it thinketh not evil, it rejoiceth not in
iniquity, but in truth. It suffereth all things, believeth all things,
hopeth all things,</q> <span class="bibcite">1 Cor. xiii. 4, 5, 6, 7</span>; <q>it covereth all trespasses,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Prov, x. 12</span>; <q>a multitude of sins,</q> <span class="bibcite">1 Pet. 4</span>, as our Saviour told the woman
in the Gospel, that washed his feet, <q>many sins were forgiven her, for she
loved much,</q> <span class="bibcite">Luke vii. 47</span>; <q>it will defend the fatherless and the widow,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Isa. i. 17</span>; <q>will seek no revenge, or be mindful of wrong,</q> <span class="bibcite">Levit. xix. 18</span>;
<q>will bring home his brother's ox if he go astray, as it is commanded,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Deut. xxii. 1</span>; <q>will resist evil, give to him that asketh, and not turn
from him that borroweth, bless them that curse him, love his enemy,</q> <span class="bibcite">Matt.
v</span>; <q>bear his brother's burthen,</q> <span class="bibcite">Gal. vi. 7.</span> He that so loves will be
hospitable, and distribute to the necessities of the saints; he will, if it
be possible, have peace with all men, <q>feed his enemy if he be hungry, if
he be athirst give him drink;</q> he will perform those seven works of mercy,
<q>he will make himself equal to them of the lower sort, rejoice with them
that rejoice, weep with them that weep,</q> <span class="bibcite">Rom. xii</span>; he will speak truth to
his neighbour, be courteous and tender-hearted, <q>forgiving others for
Christ's sake, as God forgave him,</q> <span class="bibcite">Eph. iv. 32</span>; <q>he will be like minded,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Phil. ii. 2.</span> <q>Of one judgment; be humble, meek, long-suffering,</q> <span class="bibcite">Colos.
iii.</span> <q>Forbear, forget and forgive,</q> <span class="bibcite">xii. 13. 23.</span> and what he doth shall be
heartily done to God, and not to men. <q>Be pitiful and courteous,</q> <span class="bibcite">1 Pet.
iii.</span> <q>Seek peace and follow it.</q> He will love his brother, not in word and
tongue, but in deed and truth, <span class="bibcite">John iii. 18.</span> <q>and he that loves God, Christ
will love him that is begotten of him,</q> <span class="bibcite">John v. 1</span>, &amp;c. Thus should we
willingly do, if we had a true touch of this charity, of this divine love,
if we could perform this which we are enjoined, forget and forgive, and
compose ourselves to those Christian laws of love.

<div class="line"><a href="#note4608">[4608]</a>O felix hominum genus,</div>
<div class="line">Si vestros animos amor</div>
<div class="line">Quo coelum regitur regat!</div>
</div>
<q>Angelical souls, how blessed, how happy should we be, so loving, how might
we triumph over the devil, and have another heaven upon earth!</q>

<p>But this we cannot do; and which is the cause of all our woes, miseries,
discontent, melancholy, <a href="#note4609">[4609]</a>want of this charity. We do <span lang="la">invicem
angariare</span>, contemn, consult, vex, torture, molest, and hold one another's
noses to the grindstone hard, provoke, rail, scoff, calumniate, challenge,
hate, abuse (hard-hearted, implacable, malicious, peevish, inexorable as we
are), to satisfy our lust or private spleen, for <a href="#note4610">[4610]</a>toys, trifles, and
impertinent occasions, spend ourselves, goods, friends, fortunes, to be
revenged on our adversary, to ruin him and his. 'Tis all our study,
practice, and business how to plot mischief, mine, countermine, defend and
offend, ward ourselves, injure others, hurt all; as if we were born to do
mischief, and that with such eagerness and bitterness, with such rancour,
malice, rage, and fury, we prosecute our intended designs, that neither
affinity or consanguinity, love or fear of God or men can contain us: no
satisfaction, no composition will be accepted, no offices will serve, no
submission; though he shall upon his knees, as Sarpedon did to Glaucus in
Homer, acknowledging his error, yield himself with tears in his eyes, beg
his pardon, we will not relent, forgive, or forget, till we have confounded
him and his, <q>made dice of his bones,</q> as they say, see him rot in prison,
banish his friends, followers, <span lang="la">et omne invisum genus</span>, rooted him out and
all his posterity. Monsters of men as we are, dogs, wolves, <a href="#note4611">[4611]</a>tigers,
fiends, incarnate devils, we do not only contend, oppress, and tyrannise
ourselves, but as so many firebrands, we set on, and animate others: our
whole life is a perpetual combat, a conflict, a set battle, a snarling fit.
<span lang="la">Eris dea</span> is settled in our tents, <a href="#note4612">[4612]</a><span lang="la">Omnia de lite</span>, opposing wit to
wit, wealth to wealth, strength to strength, fortunes to fortunes, friends
to friends, as at a sea-fight, we turn our broadsides, or two millstones
with continual attrition, we fire ourselves, or break another's backs, and
both are ruined and consumed in the end. Miserable wretches, to fat and
enrich ourselves, we care not how we get it, <span lang="la">Quocunque modo rem</span>; how many
thousands we undo, whom we oppress, by whose ruin and downfall we arise,
whom we injure, fatherless children, widows, common societies, to satisfy
our own private lust. Though we have myriads, abundance of wealth and
treasure, (pitiless, merciless, remorseless, and uncharitable in the
highest degree), and our poor brother in need, sickness, in great
extremity, and now ready to be starved for want of food, we had rather, as
the fox told the ape, his tail should sweep the ground still, than cover
his buttocks; rather spend it idly, consume it with dogs, hawks, hounds,
unnecessary buildings, in riotous apparel, ingurgitate, or let it be lost,
than he should have part of it; <a href="#note4613">[4613]</a>rather take from him that little
which he hath, than relieve him.

<p>Like the dog in the manger, we neither use it ourselves, let others make
use of or enjoy it; part with nothing while we live: for want of disposing
our household, and setting things in order, set all the world together by
the ears after our death. Poor Lazarus lies howling at his gates for a few
crumbs, he only seeks chippings, offals; let him roar and howl, famish, and
eat his own flesh, he respects him not. A poor decayed kinsman of his sets
upon him by the way in all his jollity, and runs begging bareheaded by him,
conjuring by those former bonds of friendship, alliance, consanguinity,
&amp;c., uncle, cousin, brother, father,
<div class="poem" lang="la">

</div>
<q>Show some pity for Christ's sake, pity a sick man, an old man,</q> &amp;c., he
cares not, ride on: pretend sickness, inevitable loss of limbs, goods,
plead suretyship, or shipwreck, fires, common calamities, show thy wants
and imperfections,

<div class="line">Et si per sanctum juratus dicat Osyrim,</div>

Swear, protest, take God and all his angels to witness, <span lang="la">quaere
peregrinum</span>, thou art a counterfeit crank, a cheater, he is not touched
with it, <span lang="la">pauper ubique jacet</span>, ride on, he takes no notice of it. Put up
a supplication to him in the name of a thousand orphans, a hospital, a
spittle, a prison, as he goes by, they cry out to him for aid, ride on,
<span lang="la">surdo narras</span>, he cares not, let them eat stones, devour themselves with
vermin, rot in their own dung, he cares not. Show him a decayed haven, a
bridge, a school, a fortification, etc., or some public work, ride on; good
your worship, your honour, for God's sake, your country's sake, ride on.
But show him a roll wherein his name shall be registered in golden letters,
and commended to all posterity, his arms set up, with his devices to be
seen, then peradventure he will stay and contribute; or if thou canst
thunder upon him, as Papists do, with satisfactory and meritorious works,
or persuade him by this means he shall save his soul out of hell, and free
it from purgatory (if he be of any religion), then in all likelihood he
will listen and stay; or that he have no children, no near kinsman, heir,
he cares for, at least, or cannot well tell otherwise how or where to
bestow his possessions (for carry them with him he cannot), it may be then
he will build some school or hospital in his life, or be induced to give
liberally to pious uses after his death. For I dare boldly say, vainglory,
that opinion of merit, and this enforced necessity, when they know not
otherwise how to leave, or what better to do with them, is the main cause
of most of our good works. I will not urge this to derogate from any man's
charitable devotion, or bounty in this kind, to censure any good work; no
doubt there be many sanctified, heroical, and worthy-minded men, that in
true zeal, and for virtue's sake (divine spirits), that out of
commiseration and pity extend their liberality, and as much as in them lies
do good to all men, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, comfort the sick and
needy, relieve all, forget and forgive injuries, as true charity requires;
yet most part there is <span lang="la">simulatum quid</span>, a deal of hypocrisy in this kind,
much default and defect. <a href="#note4614">[4614]</a>Cosmo de Medici, that rich citizen of
Florence, ingeniously confessed to a near friend of his, that would know of
him why he built so many public and magnificent palaces, and bestowed so
liberally on scholars, not that he loved learning more than others, <q>but to
<a href="#note4615">[4615]</a>eternise his own name, to be immortal by the benefit of scholars;
for when his friends were dead, walls decayed, and all inscriptions gone,
books would remain to the world's end.</q> The lantern in <a href="#note4616">[4616]</a>Athens was
built by Zenocles, the theatre by Pericles, the famous port Pyraeum by
Musicles, Pallas Palladium by Phidias, the Pantheon by Callicratidas; but
these brave monuments are decayed all, and ruined long since, their
builders' names alone flourish by meditation of writers. And as <a href="#note4617">[4617]</a>he
said of that Marian oak, now cut down and dead, <span lang="la">nullius Agricolae manu
vulta stirps tam diuturna, quam quae poetae, versu seminari potest</span>, no plant
can grow so long as that which is <span lang="la">ingenio sata</span>, set and manured by those
ever-living wits. <a href="#note4618">[4618]</a>Allon Backuth, that weeping oak, under which
Deborah, Rebecca's nurse, died, and was buried, may not survive the memory
of such everlasting monuments. Vainglory and emulation (as to most men)
was the cause efficient, and to be a trumpeter of his own fame, Cosmo's
sole intent so to do good, that all the world might take notice of it. Such
for the most part is the charity of our times, such our benefactors,
Mecaenates and patrons. Show me amongst so many myriads, a truly devout, a
right, honest, upright, meek, humble, a patient, innocuous, innocent, a
merciful, a loving, a charitable man! <a href="#note4619">[4619]</a><span lang="la">Probus quis nobiscum vivit</span>?
Show me a Caleb or a Joshua! <span lang="la">Dic mihi Musa virum</span>&mdash;show a virtuous woman,
a constant wife, a good neighbour, a trusty servant, an obedient child, a
true friend, &amp;c. Crows in Africa are not so scant. He that shall examine
this <a href="#note4620">[4620]</a>iron age wherein we live, where love is cold, <span lang="la">et jam terras

all goodness gone, where vice abounds, the devil is loose, and see one man
vilify and insult over his brother, as if he were an innocent, or a block,
oppress, tyrannise, prey upon, torture him, vex, gall, torment and crucify
him, starve him, where is charity? He that shall see men <a href="#note4622">[4622]</a>swear and
forswear, lie and bear false witness, to advantage themselves, prejudice
others, hazard goods, lives, fortunes, credit, all, to be revenged on their
enemies, men so unspeakable in their lusts, unnatural in malice, such
bloody designments, Italian blaspheming, Spanish renouncing, &amp;c., may well
ask where is charity? He that shall observe so many lawsuits, such endless
contentions, such plotting, undermining, so much money spent with such
eagerness and fury, every man for himself, his own ends, the devil for all:
so many distressed souls, such lamentable complaints, so many factions,
conspiracies, seditions, oppressions, abuses, injuries, such grudging,
repining, discontent, so much emulation, envy, so many brawls, quarrels,
monomachies, &amp;c., may well require what is become of charity? when we see
and read of such cruel wars, tumults, uproars, bloody battles, so many
<a href="#note4623">[4623]</a>men slain, so many cities ruinated, &amp;c. (for what else is the
subject of all our stones almost, but bills, bows, and guns!) so many
murders and massacres, &amp;c., where is charity? Or see men wholly devote to
God, churchmen, professed divines, holy men, <a href="#note4624">[4624]</a><q>to make the trumpet of
the gospel the trumpet of war,</q> a company of hell-born Jesuits, and
fiery-spirited friars, <span lang="la">facem praeferre</span> to all seditions: as so many
firebrands set all the world by the ears (I say nothing of their
contentious and railing books, whole ages spent in writing one against
another, and that with such virulency and bitterness, <span lang="la">Bionaeis sermonibus
et sale nigro</span>), and by their bloody inquisitions, that in thirty years,
Bale saith, consumed 39 princes, 148 earls, 235 barons, 14,755 commons;
worse than those ten persecutions, may justly doubt where is charity?
<span lang="la">Obsecro vos quales hi demum Christiani!</span> Are these Christians? I beseech
you tell me: he that shall observe and see these things, may say to them as
Cato to Caesar, <span lang="la">credo quae de inferis dicuntur falsa existimas</span>, <q>sure I
think thou art of opinion there is neither heaven nor hell.</q> Let them
pretend religion, zeal, make what shows they will, give alms, peace-makers,
frequent sermons, if we may guess at the tree by the fruit, they are no
better than hypocrites, epicures, atheists, with the <a href="#note4625">[4625]</a><q>fool in their
hearts they say there is no God.</q> 'Tis no marvel then if being so
uncharitable, hard-hearted as we are, we have so frequent and so many
discontents, such melancholy fits, so many bitter pangs, mutual discords,
all in a combustion, often complaints, so common grievances, general
mischiefs, <span lang="la">si tantae in terris tragoediae, quibus labefactatur et misere
laceratur humanum genus</span>, so many pestilences, wars, uproars, losses,
deluges, fires, inundations, God's vengeance and all the plagues of Egypt,
come upon us, since we are so currish one towards another, so respectless
of God, and our neighbours, and by our crying sins pull these miseries upon
our own heads. Nay more, 'tis justly to be feared, which <a href="#note4626">[4626]</a>Josephus
once said of his countrymen Jews, <q>if the Romans had not come when they did
to sack their city, surely it had been swallowed up with some earthquake,
deluge, or fired from heaven as Sodom and Gomorrah: their desperate malice,
wickedness and peevishness was such.</q> 'Tis to be suspected, if we continue
these wretched ways, we may look for the like heavy visitations to come
upon us. If we had any sense or feeling of these things, surely we should
not go on as we do, in such irregular courses, practise all manner of
impieties; our whole carriage would not be so averse from God. If a man
would but consider, when he is in the midst and full career of such
prodigious and uncharitable actions, how displeasing they are in God's
sight, how noxious to himself, as Solomon told Joab, <span class="bibcite">1 Kings, ii.</span> <q>The Lord
shall bring this blood upon their heads.</q> <span class="bibcite">Prov. i. 27</span>, <q>sudden desolation
and destruction shall come like a whirlwind upon them: affliction, anguish,
the reward of his hand shall be given him,</q> <span class="bibcite">Isa. iii. 11</span>, &amp;c., <q>they shall
fall into the pit they have digged for others,</q> and when they are scraping,
tyrannising, getting, wallowing in their wealth, <q>this night, O fool, I
will take away thy soul,</q> what a severe account they must make; and how
<a href="#note4627">[4627]</a>gracious on the other side a charitable man is in God's eyes,
<span lang="la">haurit sibi gratiam</span>. <span class="bibcite">Matt. v. 7</span>, <q>Blessed are the merciful, for they
shall obtain mercy: he that lendeth to the poor, gives to God,</q> and how it
shall be restored to them again; <q>how by their patience and long-suffering
they shall heap coals on their enemies' heads,</q> <span class="bibcite">Rom. xii.</span> <q>and he that
followeth after righteousness and mercy, shall find righteousness and
glory;</q> surely they would check their desires, curb in their unnatural,
inordinate affections, agree amongst themselves, abstain from doing evil,
amend their lives, and learn to do well. <q>Behold how comely and good a
thing it is for brethren to live together in <a href="#note4628">[4628]</a>union: it is like the
precious ointment, &amp;c. How odious to contend one with the other!</q> <a href="#note4629">[4629]</a>
<span lang="la">Miseriquid luctatiunculis hisce volumus? ecce mors supra caput est, et
supremum illud tribunal, ubi et dicta et facta nostra examinanda sunt:

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.2.1.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Heroical love causeth Melancholy. His Pedigree, Power, and Extent</i>.</h4>

<p>In the preceding section mention was made, amongst other pleasant objects,
of this comeliness and beauty which proceeds from women, that causeth
heroical, or love-melancholy, is more eminent above the rest, and properly
called love. The part affected in men is the liver, and therefore called
heroical, because commonly gallants. Noblemen, and the most generous
spirits are possessed with it. His power and extent is very large, <a href="#note4630">[4630]</a>
and in that twofold division of love, <span lang="gr">&phi;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&nu;</span> and <span lang="gr">&#x1F10;&rho;&#x1FB6;&nu;</span>
<a href="#note4631">[4631]</a>those two veneries which Plato and some other make mention of it is
most eminent, and <span lang="gr">&kappa;&alpha;&tau;' &#x1F10;&xi;&omicron;&chi;&#x1F74;&nu;</span> called Venus, as I have said, or
love itself. Which although it be denominated from men, and most evident in
them, yet it extends and shows itself in vegetal and sensible creatures,
those incorporeal substances (as shall be specified), and hath a large
dominion of sovereignty over them. His pedigree is very ancient, derived
from the beginning of the world, as <a href="#note4632">[4632]</a>Phaedrus contends, and his <a href="#note4633">[4633]</a>
parentage of such antiquity, that no poet could ever find it out. Hesiod
makes <a href="#note4634">[4634]</a>Terra and Chaos to be Love's parents, before the Gods were
born: <span lang="la">Ante deos omnes primum generavit amorem</span>. Some think it is the
self-same fire Prometheus fetched from heaven. Plutarch <span class="cite">amator. libello</span>,
will have Love to be the son of Iris and Favonius; but Socrates in that
pleasant dialogue of Plato, when it came to his turn to speak of love, (of
which subject Agatho the rhetorician, <span lang="la">magniloquus</span> Agatho, that chanter
Agatho, had newly given occasion) in a poetical strain, telleth this tale:
when Venus was born, all the gods were invited to a banquet, and amongst
the rest, <a href="#note4635">[4635]</a>Porus the god of bounty and wealth; Penia or Poverty came
a begging to the door; Porus well whittled with nectar (for there was no
wine in those days) walking in Jupiter's garden, in a bower met with Penia,
and in his drink got her with child, of whom was born Love; and because he
was begotten on Venus's birthday, Venus still attends upon him. The moral
of this is in <a href="#note4636">[4636]</a>Ficinus. Another tale is there borrowed out of
Aristophanes: <a href="#note4637">[4637]</a>in the beginning of the world, men had four arms and
four feet, but for their pride, because they compared themselves with the
gods, were parted into halves, and now peradventure by love they hope to be
united again and made one. Otherwise thus, <a href="#note4638">[4638]</a>Vulcan met two lovers,
and bid them ask what they would and they should have it; but they made
answer, <span lang="la">O Vulcane faber Deorum</span>, &amp;c. <q>O Vulcan the gods' great smith, we
beseech thee to work us anew in thy furnace, and of two make us one; which
he presently did, and ever since true lovers are either all one, or else
desire to be united.</q> Many such tales you shall find in Leon Hebreus,
<span class="cite">dial. 3.</span> and their moral to them. The reason why Love was still painted
young, (as Phornutus <a href="#note4639">[4639]</a>and others will) <a href="#note4640">[4640]</a><q>is because young men
are most apt to love; soft, fair, and fat, because such folks are soonest
taken: naked, because all true affection is simple and open: he smiles,
because merry and given to delights: hath a quiver, to show his power, none
can escape: is blind, because he sees not where he strikes, whom he hits,
&amp;c.</q> His power and sovereignty is expressed by the <a href="#note4641">[4641]</a>poets, in that he
is held to be a god, and a great commanding god, above Jupiter himself;
Magnus Daemon, as Plato calls him, the strongest and merriest of all the
gods according to Alcinous and <a href="#note4642">[4642]</a>Athenaeus. <span lang="la">Amor virorum rex, amor rex
et deum</span>, as Euripides, the god of gods and governor of men; for we must
all do homage to him, keep a holiday for his deity, adore in his temples,
worship his image, (<span lang="la">numen enim hoc non est nudum nomen</span>) and sacrifice to
his altar, that conquers all, and rules all:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4643">[4643]</a>Mallem cum icone, cervo et apro Aeolico,</div>
<div class="line">Cum Anteo et Stymphalicis avibus luctari</div>
<div class="line">Quam cum amore&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
<q>I had rather contend with bulls, lions, bears, and giants, than with
Love;</q> he is so powerful, enforceth <a href="#note4644">[4644]</a>all to pay tribute to him,
domineers over all, and can make mad and sober whom he list; insomuch that
Caecilius in Tully's Tusculans, holds him to be no better than a fool or an
idiot, that doth not acknowledge Love to be a great god.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4645">[4645]</a>Cui in manu sit quem esse dementem velit,</div>
<div class="line">Quem sapere, quam in morbum injici, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
That can make sick, and cure whom he list. Homer and Stesichorus were both
made blind, if you will believe <a href="#note4646">[4646]</a>Leon Hebreus, for speaking against
his godhead: and though Aristophanes degrade him, and say that he was
<a href="#note4647">[4647]</a>scornfully rejected from the council of the gods, had his wings
clipped besides, that he might come no more amongst them, and to his
farther disgrace banished heaven for ever, and confined to dwell on earth,
yet he is of that <a href="#note4648">[4648]</a>power, majesty, omnipotency, and dominion, that no
creature can withstand him.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4649">[4649]</a>Imperat Cupido etiam diis pro arbitrio,</div>

<div class="line">Thetide aequor, umbras Aeaco, coelum Jove:</div>
</div>
and hath not so much possession as dominion. Jupiter himself was turned
into a satyr, shepherd, a bull, a swan, a golden shower, and what not, for
love; that as <a href="#note4651">[4651]</a>Lucian's Juno right well objected to him, <span lang="la">ludus
amoris tu es</span>, thou art Cupid's whirligig: how did he insult over all the
other gods, Mars, Neptune, Pan, Mercury, Bacchus, and the rest? <a href="#note4652">[4652]</a>
Lucian brings in Jupiter complaining of Cupid that he could not be quiet
for him; and the moon lamenting that she was so impotently besotted on
Endymion, even Venus herself confessing as much, how rudely and in what
sort her own son Cupid had used her being his <a href="#note4653">[4653]</a>mother, <q>now drawing
her to Mount Ida, for the love of that Trojan Anchises, now to Libanus for
that Assyrian youth's sake. And although she threatened to break his bow
and arrows, to clip his wings, <a href="#note4654">[4654]</a>and whipped him besides on the bare
buttocks with her pantofle, yet all would not serve, he was too
headstrong and unruly.</q> That monster-conquering Hercules was tamed by him:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Quem non mille ferae, quem non Sthenelejus hostis,</div>
<div class="line">Nec potuit Juno vincere, vicit amor.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Whom neither beasts nor enemies could tame,</div>
<div class="line">Nor Juno's might subdue, Love quell'd the same.</div>
</div>
Your bravest soldiers and most generous spirits are enervated with it,
<a href="#note4655">[4655]</a><span lang="la">ubi mulieribus blanditiis permittunt se, et inquinantur
amplexibus</span>. Apollo, that took upon him to cure all diseases, <a href="#note4656">[4656]</a>could
not help himself of this; and therefore <a href="#note4657">[4657]</a>Socrates calls Love a
tyrant, and brings him triumphing in a chariot, whom Petrarch imitates in
his triumph of Love, and Fracastorius, in an elegant poem expresseth at
large, Cupid riding, Mars and Apollo following his chariot, Psyche weeping,
&amp;c.

<p>In vegetal creatures what sovereignty love hath, by many pregnant proofs
and familiar examples may be proved, especially of palm-trees, which are
both he and she, and express not a sympathy but a love-passion, and by many
observations have been confirmed.

<div class="line">Et platano platanus, alnoque assibilat alnus.</div>
</div>
Constantine <span class="cite">de Agric. lib. 10. cap. 4.</span> gives an instance out of
Florentius his Georgics, of a palm-tree that loved most fervently, <a href="#note4659">[4659]</a>
<q>and would not be comforted until such time her love applied herself unto
her; you might see the two trees bend, and of their own accords stretch out
their boughs to embrace and kiss each other: they will give manifest signs
of mutual love.</q> Ammianus Marcellinus, <span class="cite">lib. 24</span>, reports that they marry
one another, and fall in love if they grow in sight; and when the wind
brings the smell to them, they are marvellously affected. Philostratus <span class="cite">in
Imaginibus</span>, observes as much, and Galen <span class="cite">lib. 6. de locis affectis,
cap. 5.</span> they will be sick for love; ready to die and pine away, which the
husbandmen perceiving, saith <a href="#note4660">[4660]</a>Constantine, <q>stroke many palms that
grow together, and so stroking again the palm that is enamoured, they carry
kisses from the one to the other:</q> or tying the leaves and branches of the
one to the stem of the other, will make them both flourish and prosper a
great deal better: <a href="#note4661">[4661]</a><q>which are enamoured, they can perceive by the
bending of boughs, and inclination of their bodies.</q> If any man think this
which I say to be a tale, let him read that story of two palm-trees in
Italy, the male growing at Brundusium, the female at Otranto (related by
Jovianus Pontanus in an excellent poem, sometimes tutor to Alphonsus
junior, King of Naples, his secretary of state, and a great philosopher)
<q>which were barren, and so continued a long time,</q> till they came to see
one another growing up higher, though many stadiums asunder. Pierius in his
Hieroglyphics, and Melchior Guilandinus, <span class="cite">Mem. 3. tract. de papyro</span>,
cites this story of Pontanus for a truth. See more in Salmuth <span class="cite">Comment. in
Pancirol. de Nova repert. Tit. 1. de novo orbe</span> Mizaldus Arcanorum
<span class="cite">lib. 2.</span> Sand's Voyages, <span class="cite">lib. 2. fol. 103.</span> &amp;c.

<p>If such fury be in vegetals, what shall we think of sensible creatures, how

Common experience and our sense will inform us how violently brute beasts
are carried away with this passion, horses above the rest,&mdash;<span lang="la">furor est
insignis equarum</span>. <a href="#note4664">[4664]</a><q>Cupid in Lucian bids Venus his mother be of good
cheer, for he was now familiar with lions, and oftentimes did get on their
backs, hold them by the mane, and ride them about like horses, and they
would fawn upon him with their tails.</q> Bulls, bears, and boars are so
furious in this kind they kill one another: but especially cocks, <a href="#note4665">[4665]</a>
lions, and harts, which are so fierce that you may hear them fight half a
mile off, saith <a href="#note4666">[4666]</a>Turberville, and many times kill each other, or
compel them to abandon the rut, that they may remain masters in their
places; <q>and when one hath driven his co-rival away, he raiseth his nose up
into the air, and looks aloft, as though he gave thanks to nature,</q> which
affords him such great delight. How birds are affected in this kind,
appears out of Aristotle, he will have them to sing <span lang="la">ob futuram venerem</span>
for joy or in hope of their venery which is to come.

<q>Fishes pine away for love and wax lean,</q> if <a href="#note4668">[4668]</a>Gomesius's authority
may be taken, and are rampant too, some of them: Peter Gellius, <span class="cite">lib. 10.
de hist, animal.</span> tells wonders of a triton in Epirus: there was a well
not far from the shore, where the country wenches fetched water, they,
<a href="#note4669">[4669]</a>tritons, <span lang="la">stupri causa</span> would set upon them and carry them to the
sea, and there drown them, if they would not yield; so love tyranniseth in
dumb creatures. Yet this is natural for one beast to dote upon another of
the same kind; but what strange fury is that, when a beast shall dote upon
a man? Saxo Grammaticus, <span class="cite">lib. 10. Dan. hist.</span> hath a story of a bear
that loved a woman, kept her in his den a long time and begot a son of her,
out of whose loins proceeded many northern kings: this is the original
belike of that common tale of Valentine and Orson: Aelian, Pliny, Peter
Gillius, are full of such relations. A peacock in Lucadia loved a maid, and
when she died, the peacock pined. <a href="#note4670">[4670]</a><q>A dolphin loved a boy called
Hernias, and when he died, the fish came on land, and so perished.</q> The
like adds Gellius, <span class="cite">lib. 10. cap. 22.</span> out of Appion, <span class="cite">Aegypt. lib. 15.</span> a
dolphin at Puteoli loved a child, would come often to him, let him get on
his back, and carry him about, <a href="#note4671">[4671]</a><q>and when by sickness the child was
taken away, the dolphin died.</q> <a href="#note4672">[4672]</a><q>Every book is full</q> (saith
Busbequius, the emperor's orator with the Grand Signior, not long since,
<span class="cite">ep. 3. legat. Turc.</span>), <q>and yields such instances, to believe which I was
always afraid lest I should be thought to give credit to fables, until I
saw a lynx which I had from Assyria, so affected towards one of my men,
that it cannot be denied but that he was in love with him. When my man was
present, the beast would use many notable enticements and pleasant motions,
and when he was going, hold him back, and look after him when he was gone,
very sad in his absence, but most jocund when he returned: and when my man
went from me, the beast expressed his love with continual sickness, and
after he had pined away some few days, died.</q> Such another story he hath of
a crane of Majorca, that loved a Spaniard, that would walk any way with
him, and in his absence seek about for him, make a noise that he might hear
her, and knock at his door, <a href="#note4673">[4673]</a><q>and when he took his last farewell,
famished herself.</q> Such pretty pranks can love play with birds, fishes,
beasts:

and if all be certain that is credibly reported, with the spirits of the
air, and devils of hell themselves, who are as much enamoured and dote (if
I may use that word) as any other creatures whatsoever. For if those
stories be true that are written of incubus and succubus, of nymphs,
lascivious fauns, satyrs, and those heathen gods which were devils, those
lascivious Telchines, of whom the Platonists tell so many fables; or those
familiar meetings in our days, and company of witches and devils, there is
some probability for it. I know that Biarmannus, Wierus, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap.
19. et 24.</span> and some others stoutly deny it, that the devil hath any
carnal copulation with women, that the devil takes no pleasure in such
facts, they be mere fantasies, all such relations of incubi, succubi, lies
and tales; but Austin, <span class="cite">lib. 15. de civit. Dei</span>. doth acknowledge it:
Erastus <span class="cite">de Lamiis</span>, Jacobus Sprenger and his colleagues, &amp;c. <a href="#note4675">[4675]</a>
Zanchius, <span class="cite">cap. 16. lib. 4. de oper. Dei</span>. Dandinus, <span class="cite">in Arist. de
Anima, lib. 2. text. 29. com. 30.</span> Bodin, <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 7.</span> and
Paracelsus, a great champion of this tenet amongst the rest, which give
sundry peculiar instances, by many testimonies, proofs, and confessions
evince it. Hector Boethius, in his Scottish history, hath three or four
such examples, which Cardan confirms out of him, <span class="cite">lib. 16. cap. 43.</span> of
such as have had familiar company many years with them, and that in the
habit of men and women Philostratus in his fourth book <span class="cite">de vita Apollonii</span>,
hath a memorable instance in this kind, which I may not omit, of one
Menippus Lycius, a young man twenty-five years of age, that going between
Cenchreas and Corinth, met such a phantasm in the habit of a fair
gentlewoman, which taking him by the hand, carried him home to her house in
the suburbs of Corinth, and told him she was a Phoenician by birth, and if
he would tarry with her, <a href="#note4676">[4676]</a><q>he should hear her sing and play, and
drink such wine as never any drank, and no man should molest him; but she
being fair and lovely would live and die with him, that was fair and lovely
to behold.</q> The young man a philosopher, otherwise staid and discreet, able
to moderate his passions, though not this of love, tarried with her awhile
to his great content, and at last married her, to whose wedding, amongst
other guests, came Apollonius, who, by some probable conjectures, found her
out to be a serpent, a lamia, and that all her furniture was like
Tantalus's gold described by Homer, no substance, but mere illusions. When
she saw herself descried, she wept, and desired Apollonius to be silent,
but he would not be moved, and thereupon she, plate, house, and all that
was in it, vanished in an instant: <a href="#note4677">[4677]</a><q>many thousands took notice of
this fact, for it was done in the midst of Greece.</q> Sabine in his Comment
on the tenth of Ovid's Metamorphoses, at the tale of Orpheus, telleth us of
a gentleman of Bavaria, that for many months together bewailed the loss of
his dear wife; at length the devil in her habit came and comforted him, and
told him, because he was so importunate for her, that she would come and
live with him again, on that condition he would be new married, never swear
and blaspheme as he used formerly to do; for if he did, she should be gone:
<a href="#note4678">[4678]</a><q>he vowed it, married, and lived with her, she brought him children,
and governed his house, but was still pale and sad, and so continued, till
one day falling out with him, he fell a swearing; she vanished thereupon,
and was never after seen.</q> <a href="#note4679">[4679]</a><q>This I have heard,</q> saith Sabine, <q>from
persons of good credit, which told me that the Duke of Bavaria did tell it
for a certainty to the Duke of Saxony.</q> One more I will relate out of
Florilegus, <i>ad annum</i> 1058, an honest historian of our nation, because he
telleth it so confidently, as a thing in those days talked of all over
Europe: a young gentleman of Rome, the same day that he was married, after
dinner with the bride and his friends went a walking into the fields, and
towards evening to the tennis-court to recreate himself; whilst he played,
he put his ring upon the finger of <span lang="la">Venus statua</span>, which was thereby made
in brass; after he had sufficiently played, and now made an end of his
sport, he came to fetch his ring, but Venus had bowed her finger in, and he
could not get it off. Whereupon loath to make his company tarry at present,
there left it, intending to fetch it the next day, or at some more
convenient time, went thence to supper, and so to bed. In the night, when
he should come to perform those nuptial rites, Venus steps between him and
his wife (unseen or felt of her), and told her that she was his wife, that
he had betrothed himself unto her by that ring, which he put upon her
finger: she troubled him for some following nights. He not knowing how to
help himself, made his moan to one Palumbus, a learned magician in those
days, who gave him a letter, and bid him at such a time of the night, in
such a cross-way, at the town's end, where old Saturn would pass by with
his associates in procession, as commonly he did, deliver that script with
his own hands to Saturn himself; the young man of a bold spirit,
accordingly did it; and when the old fiend had read it, he called Venus to
him, who rode before him, and commanded her to deliver his ring, which
forthwith she did, and so the gentleman was freed. Many such stories I find
in several <a href="#note4680">[4680]</a>authors to confirm this which I have said; as that more
notable amongst the rest, of Philinium and Machates in <a href="#note4681">[4681]</a>Phlegon's
Tract, <span class="cite">de rebus mirabilibus</span>, and though many be against it, yet I, for my
part, will subscribe to Lactantius, <span class="cite">lib. 14. cap. 15.</span> <a href="#note4682">[4682]</a><q>God sent
angels to the tuition of men; but whilst they lived amongst us, that
mischievous all-commander of the earth, and hot in lust, enticed them by
little and little to this vice, and defiled them with the company of women:</q>
and to Anaxagoras, <span class="cite">de resurrect</span>. <a href="#note4683">[4683]</a><q>Many of those spiritual bodies,
overcome by the love of maids, and lust, failed, of whom those were born we
call giants.</q> Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Sulpicius Severus,
Eusebius, etc., to this sense make a twofold fall of angels, one from the
beginning of the world, another a little before the deluge, as Moses
teacheth us, <a href="#note4684">[4684]</a>openly professing that these genii can beget, and have
carnal copulation with women. At Japan in the East Indies, at this present
(if we may believe the relation of <a href="#note4685">[4685]</a>travellers), there is an idol
called Teuchedy, to whom one of the fairest virgins in the country is
monthly brought, and left in a private room, in the fotoqui, or church,
where she sits alone to be deflowered. At certain times <a href="#note4686">[4686]</a>the Teuchedy
(which is thought to be the devil) appears to her, and knoweth her
carnally. Every month a fair virgin is taken in; but what becomes of the
old, no man can tell. In that goodly temple of Jupiter Belus in Babylon,
there was a fair chapel, <a href="#note4687">[4687]</a>saith Herodotus, an eyewitness of it, in
which was <span lang="la">splendide stratus lectus et apposita mensa aurea</span>, a brave bed,
a table of gold, &amp;c., into which no creature came but one only woman, which
their god made choice of, as the Chaldean priests told him, and that their
god lay with her himself, as at Thebes in Egypt was the like done of old.
So that you see this is no news, the devils themselves, or their juggling
priests, have played such pranks in all ages. Many divines stiffly
contradict this; but I will conclude with <a href="#note4688">[4688]</a>Lipsius, that since
<q>examples, testimonies, and confessions, of those unhappy women are so
manifest on the other side, and many even in this our town of Louvain, that
it is likely to be so. <a href="#note4689">[4689]</a>One thing I will add, that I suppose that in
no age past, I know not by what destiny of this unhappy time, have there
ever appeared or showed themselves so many lecherous devils, satyrs, and
genii, as in this of ours, as appears by the daily narrations, and judicial
sentences upon record.</q> Read more of this question in Plutarch, <span class="cite">vit.

<h4><a name="3.2.1.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>How Love tyranniseth over men. Love, or Heroical Melancholy, his definition, part affected</i>.</h4>

<p>You have heard how this tyrant Love rageth with brute beasts and spirits;
now let us consider what passions it causeth amongst men. <a href="#note4690">[4690]</a><span lang="la">Improbe amor quid non mortalia pectora cogis</span>? How it tickles the
hearts of mortal men, <span lang="la">Horresco referens</span>,&mdash;I am almost afraid to relate,
amazed, <a href="#note4691">[4691]</a>and ashamed, it hath wrought such stupendous and prodigious
effects, such foul offences. Love indeed (I may not deny) first united
provinces, built cities, and by a perpetual generation makes and preserves
mankind, propagates the church; but if it rage it is no more love, but
burning lust, a disease, frenzy, madness, hell. <a href="#note4692">[4692]</a><span lang="la">Est orcus ille, vis
est immedicabilis, est rabies insana</span>; 'tis no virtuous habit this, but a
vehement perturbation of the mind, a monster of nature, wit, and art, as
Alexis in <a href="#note4693">[4693]</a>Athenaeus sets it out, <span lang="la">viriliter audax, muliebriter
timidium, furore praeceps, labore infractum, mel felleum, blanda percussio</span>,
&amp;c. It subverts kingdoms, overthrows cities, towns, families, mars,
corrupts, and makes a massacre of men; thunder and lightning, wars, fires,
plagues, have not done that mischief to mankind, as this burning lust, this
brutish passion. Let Sodom and Gomorrah, Troy, (which Dares Phrygius, and
Dictis Cretensis will make good) and I know not how many cities bear
record,&mdash;<span lang="la">et fuit ante Helenam</span>, &amp;c., all succeeding ages will subscribe:
Joanna of Naples in Italy, Fredegunde and Brunhalt in France, all histories
are full of these basilisks. Besides those daily monomachies, murders,
effusion of blood, rapes, riot, and immoderate expense, to satisfy their
lusts, beggary, shame, loss, torture, punishment, disgrace, loathsome
diseases that proceed from thence, worse than calentures and pestilent
fevers, those often gouts, pox, arthritis, palsies, cramps, sciatica,
convulsions, aches, combustions, &amp;c., which torment the body, that feral
melancholy which crucifies the soul in this life, and everlastingly
torments in the world to come.

<p>Notwithstanding they know these and many such miseries, threats, tortures,
will surely come upon them, rewards, exhortations, <span lang="la">e contra</span>; yet either
out of their own weakness, a depraved nature, or love's tyranny, which so
furiously rageth, they suffer themselves to be led like an ox to the
slaughter: (<span lang="la">Facilis descensus Averni</span>) they go down headlong to their own
perdition, they will commit folly with beasts, men <q>leaving the natural use
of women,</q> as <a href="#note4694">[4694]</a>Paul saith, <q>burned in lust one towards another, and
man with man wrought filthiness.</q>

<p>I come at last to that heroical love which is proper to men and women, is a
frequent cause of melancholy, and deserves much rather to be called burning
lust, than by such an honourable title. There is an honest love, I confess,
which is natural, laqueus occultus captivans corda hominum, ut a mulieribus
non possint separari, <q>a secret snare to captivate the hearts of men,</q> as
<a href="#note4712">[4712]</a>Christopher Fonseca proves, a strong allurement, of a most
attractive, occult, adamantine property, and powerful virtue, and no man
living can avoid it. <a href="#note4713">[4713]</a><span lang="la">Et qui vim non sensit amoris, aut lapis est,
aut bellua</span>. He is not a man but a block, a very stone, <span lang="la">aut <a href="#note4714">[4714]</a>Numen,
aut Nebuchadnezzar</span>, he hath a gourd for his head, a pepon for his heart,
that hath not felt the power of it, and a rare creature to be found, one in
an age, <span lang="la">Qui nunquam visae flagravit amore puellae</span>; <a href="#note4715">[4715]</a>for <span lang="la">semel

none are excepted but Minerva and the Muses: so Cupid in <a href="#note4717">[4717]</a>Lucian
complains to his mother Venus, that amongst all the rest his arrows could
not pierce them. But this nuptial love is a common passion, an honest, for
men to love in the way of marriage; <span lang="la">ut materia appetit formam, sic mulier

scolding, lovingly as they should do.

<p>As Seneca lived with his Paulina, Abraham and Sarah, Orpheus and Eurydice,
Arria and Poetus, Artemisia and Mausolus, Rubenius Celer, that would needs
have it engraven on his tomb, he had led his life with Ennea, his dear
wife, forty-three years eight months, and never fell out. There is no
pleasure in this world comparable to it, 'tis <span lang="la">summum mortalitatis bonum&mdash;
<a href="#note4721">[4721]</a>hominum divumque voluptas, Alma Venus&mdash;latet enim in muliere aliquid
majus potentiusque, omnibus aliis humanis voluptatibus</span>, as <a href="#note4722">[4722]</a>one
holds, there's something in a woman beyond all human delight; a magnetic
virtue, a charming quality, an occult and powerful motive. The husband
rules her as head, but she again commands his heart, he is her servant, she
is only joy and content: no happiness is like unto it, no love so great as
this of man and wife, no such comfort as <a href="#note4723">[4723]</a><span lang="la">placens uxor</span>, a sweet
wife: <a href="#note4724">[4724]</a><span lang="la">Omnis amor magnus, sed aperto in conjuge major</span>. When they
love at last as fresh as they did at first, <a href="#note4725">[4725]</a><span lang="la">Charaque charo

been married ten years, protesting withal that he loved her as dear as he

make much of one another, saying, as he did to his wife in the poet,

Such should conjugal love be, still the same, and as they are one flesh, so
should they be of one mind, as in an aristocratical government, one
consent, <a href="#note4727">[4727]</a>Geyron-like, <span lang="la">coalescere in unum</span>, have one heart in two
bodies, will and nill the same. A good wife, according to Plutarch, should
be as a looking-glass to represent her husband's face and passion: if he be
pleasant, she should be merry: if he laugh, she should smile: if he look
sad, she should participate of his sorrow, and bear a part with him, and so
should they continue in mutual love one towards another.

<p>'Tis a happy state this indeed, when the fountain is blessed (saith
Solomon, <span class="bibcite">Prov. v. 17.</span>) <q>and he rejoiceth with the wife of his youth, and
she is to him as the loving hind and pleasant roe, and he delights in her
continually.</q> But this love of ours is immoderate, inordinate, and not to
be comprehended in any bounds. It will not contain itself within the union
of marriage, or apply to one object, but is a wandering, extravagant, a
domineering, a boundless, an irrefragable, a destructive passion: sometimes
this burning lust rageth after marriage, and then it is properly called
jealousy; sometimes before, and then it is called heroical melancholy; it
extends sometimes to co-rivals, &amp;c., begets rapes, incests, murders:
<span lang="la">Marcus Antonius compressit Faustinam sororem, Caracalla Juliam Novercam,
Nero Matrem, Caligula sorores, Cyneras Myrrham filiam</span>, &amp;c. But it is
confined within no terms of blood, years, sex, or whatsoever else. Some
furiously rage before they come to discretion, or age. <a href="#note4730">[4730]</a>Quartilla in
Petronius never remembered she was a maid; and the wife of Bath, in
Chaucer, cracks,

<a href="#note4731">[4731]</a>Aratine Lucretia sold her maidenhead a thousand times before she was
twenty-four years old, <span lang="la">plus milies vendiderant virginitatem, &amp;c. neque te
celabo, non deerant qui ut integram ambirent</span>. Rahab, that harlot, began to
be a professed quean at ten years of age, and was but fifteen when she hid
the spies, as <a href="#note4732">[4732]</a>Hugh Broughton proves, to whom Serrarius the Jesuit,
<span class="cite">quaest. 6. in cap. 2. Josue</span>, subscribes. Generally women begin
<span lang="la">pubescere</span>, as they call it, or <span lang="la">catullire</span>, as Julius Pollux cites, <span class="cite">lib.
2. cap. 3. onomast</span> out of Aristophanes, <a href="#note4733">[4733]</a>at fourteen years old, then
they do offer themselves, and some plainly rage. <a href="#note4734">[4734]</a>Leo Afer saith,
that in Africa a man shall scarce find a maid at fourteen years of age,
they are so forward, and many amongst us after they come into the teens do
not live without husbands, but linger. What pranks in this kind the middle
ages have played is not to be recorded. <span lang="la">Si mihi sint centum linguae, sint
oraque centum</span>, no tongue can sufficiently declare, every story is full of
men and women's insatiable lust, Nero's, Heliogabali, Bonosi, &amp;c. <a href="#note4735">[4735]</a>
<span lang="la">Coelius Amphilenum, sed Quintius Amphelinam depereunt</span>, &amp;c. They neigh
after other men's wives (as Jeremia, <span class="cite">cap. v. 8.</span> complaineth) like fed
horses, or range like town bulls, <span lang="la">raptores virginum et viduarum</span>, as many
of our great ones do. Solomon's wisdom was extinguished in this fire of
lust, Samson's strength enervated, piety in Lot's daughters quite forgot,
gravity of priesthood in Eli's sons, reverend old age in the Elders that
would violate Susanna, filial duty in Absalom to his stepmother, brotherly
love in Ammon. towards his sister. Human, divine laws, precepts,
exhortations, fear of God and men, fair, foul means, fame, fortune, shame,
disgrace, honour cannot oppose, stave off, or withstand the fury of it,
<span lang="la">omnia vincit amor</span>, &amp;c. No cord nor cable can so forcibly draw, or hold so
fast, as love can do with, a twined thread. The scorching beams under the
equinoctial, or extremity of cold within the circle arctic, where the very
seas are frozen, cold or torrid zone, cannot avoid or expel this heat,
fury, and rage of mortal men.

</div>
<p>Of women's unnatural, <a href="#note4737">[4737]</a>insatiable lust, what country, what village
doth not complain? Mother and daughter sometimes dote on the same man,
father and son, master and servant, on one woman.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4738">[4738]</a>&mdash;Sed amor, sed ineffrenata libido,</div>
<div class="line">Quid castum in terris intentatumque reliquit?</div>
</div>
What breach of vows and oaths, fury, dotage, madness, might I reckon up?
Yet this is more tolerable in youth, and such as are still in their hot
blood; but for an old fool to dote, to see an old lecher, what more odious,
what can be more absurd? and yet what so common? Who so furious?<a href="#note4739">[4739]</a>
<span lang="la">Amare ea aetate si occiperint, multo insaniunt acrius</span>. Some dote then
more than ever they did in their youth. How many decrepit, hoary, harsh,
writhen, bursten-bellied, crooked, toothless, bald, blear-eyed, impotent,
rotten, old men shall you see flickering still in every place? One gets him
a young wife, another a courtesan, and when he can scarce lift his leg over
a sill, and hath one foot already in Charon's boat, when he hath the
trembling in his joints, the gout in his feet, a perpetual rheum in his
head, <q>a continuate cough,</q> <a href="#note4740">[4740]</a>his sight fails him, thick of hearing,
his breath stinks, all his moisture is dried up and gone, may not spit from
him, a very child again, that cannot dress himself, or cut his own meat,
yet he will be dreaming of, and honing after wenches, what can be more
unseemly? Worse it is in women than in men, when she is <span lang="la">aetate declivis,
diu vidua, mater olim, parum decore matrimonium sequi videtur</span>, an old
widow, a mother so long since (<a href="#note4741">[4741]</a>in Pliny's opinion), she doth very
unseemly seek to marry, yet whilst she is <a href="#note4742">[4742]</a>so old a crone, a beldam,
she can neither see, nor hear, go nor stand, a mere <a href="#note4743">[4743]</a>carcass, a
witch, and scarce feel; she caterwauls, and must have a stallion, a
champion, she must and will marry again, and betroth herself to some young
man, <a href="#note4744">[4744]</a>that hates to look on, but for her goods; abhors the sight of
her, to the prejudice of her good name, her own undoing, grief of friends,
and ruin of her children.

<p>But to enlarge or illustrate this power and effects of love, is to set a
candle in the sun. <a href="#note4745">[4745]</a>It rageth with all sorts and conditions of men,
yet is most evident among such as are young and lusty, in the flower of
their years, nobly descended, high fed, such as live idly, and at ease; and
for that cause (which our divines call burning lust) this <a href="#note4746">[4746]</a><span lang="la">ferinus
insanus amor</span>, this mad and beastly passion, as I have said, is named by
our physicians heroical love, and a more honourable title put upon it,
<span lang="la">Amor nobilis</span>, as <a href="#note4747">[4747]</a>Savanarola styles it, because noble men and women
make a common practice of it, and are so ordinarily affected with it.
Avicenna, <span class="cite">lib. 3. Fen, 1. tract. 4. cap. 23.</span> calleth this passion
<i>Ilishi</i>, and defines it <a href="#note4748">[4748]</a><q>to be a disease or melancholy vexation, or
anguish of mind, in which a man continually meditates of the beauty,
gesture, manners of his mistress, and troubles himself about it:</q> desiring,
(as Savanarola adds) with all intentions and eagerness of mind, <q>to compass
or enjoy her, <a href="#note4749">[4749]</a>as commonly hunters trouble themselves about their
sports, the covetous about their gold and goods, so is he tormented still
about his mistress.</q> Arnoldus Villanovanus, in his book of heroical love,
defines it, <a href="#note4750">[4750]</a><q>a continual cogitation of that which he desires, with a
confidence or hope of compassing it;</q> which definition his commentator
cavils at. For continual cogitation is not the genus but a symptom of
love; we continually think of that which we hate and abhor, as well as that
which we love; and many things we covet and desire, without all hope of
attaining. Carolus a Lorme, in his Questions, makes a doubt, <span lang="la">An amor sit
morbus</span>, whether this heroical love be a disease: Julius Pollux <span class="cite">Onomast.
lib. 6. cap. 44.</span> determines it. They that are in love are likewise
<a href="#note4751">[4751]</a>sick; <span lang="la">lascivus, salax, lasciviens, et qui in venerem furit, vere
est aegrotus</span>, Arnoldus will have it improperly so called, and a malady
rather of the body than mind. Tully, in his <span class="cite">Tusculans</span>, defines it a
furious disease of the mind. Plato, madness itself. Ficinus, his
Commentator, <span class="cite">cap. 12.</span> a species of madness, <q>for many have run mad for
women,</q> <span class="bibcite">Esdr. iv. 26.</span> But <a href="#note4752">[4752]</a>Rhasis <q>a melancholy passion:</q> and most
physicians make it a species or kind of melancholy (as will appear by the
symptoms), and treat of it apart; whom I mean to imitate, and to discuss it
in all his kinds, to examine his several causes, to show his symptoms,
indications, prognostics, effect, that so it may be with more facility
cured.

<p>The part affected in the meantime, as <a href="#note4753">[4753]</a>Arnoldus supposeth, <q>is the
former part of the head for want of moisture,</q> which his Commentator
rejects. Langius, <span class="cite">med. epist. lib. 1. cap. 24.</span> will have this passion
seated in the liver, and to keep residence in the heart, <a href="#note4754">[4754]</a><q>to proceed
first from the eyes so carried by our spirits, and kindled with imagination
in the liver and heart;</q> <span lang="la">coget amare jecur</span>, as the saying is. <span lang="la">Medium
feret per epar</span>, as Cupid in Anacreon. For some such cause belike <a href="#note4755">[4755]</a>
Homer feigns Titius' liver (who was enamoured of Latona) to be still gnawed
by two vultures day and night in hell, <a href="#note4756">[4756]</a><q>for that young men's bowels
thus enamoured, are so continually tormented by love.</q> Gordonius, <span class="cite">cap. 2.
part. 2.</span> <a href="#note4757">[4757]</a><q>will have the testicles an immediate subject or cause,
the liver an antecedent.</q> Fracastorius agrees in this with Gordonius, <span lang="la">inde
primitus imaginatio venerea, erectio, &amp;c. titillatissimam partem vocat, ita
ut nisi extruso semine gestiens voluptas non cessat, nec assidua veneris
recordatio, addit Gnastivinius</span> <span class="cite">Comment. 4. Sect. prob. 27. Arist.</span> But
<a href="#note4758">[4758]</a>properly it is a passion of the brain, as all other melancholy, by
reason of corrupt imagination, and so doth Jason Pratensis, <span class="cite">c. 19. de
morb. cerebri</span> (who writes copiously of this erotical love), place and
reckon it amongst the affections of the brain. <a href="#note4759">[4759]</a>Melancthon <span class="cite">de anima</span>
confutes those that make the liver a part affected, and Guianerius, <span class="cite">Tract.
15. cap. 13 et 17.</span> though many put all the affections in the heart, refers
it to the brain. Ficinus, <span class="cite">cap. 7. in Convivium Platonis</span>, <q>will have the
blood to be the part affected.</q> Jo. Frietagius, <span class="cite">cap. 14. noct. med.</span>
supposeth all four affected, heart, liver, brain, blood; but the major part
concur upon the brain, <a href="#note4760">[4760]</a>'tis <span lang="la">imaginatio laesa</span>; and both imagination
and reason are misaffected;, because of his corrupt judgment, and continual
meditation of that which he desires, he may truly be said to be melancholy.
If it be violent, or his disease inveterate, as I have determined in the
precedent partitions, both imagination and reason are misaffected, first
one, then the other.

<p>Of all causes the remotest are stars. <a href="#note4761">[4761]</a>Ficinus <span class="cite">cap. 19.</span> saith they
are most prone to this burning lust, that have Venus in Leo in their
horoscope, when the Moon and Venus be mutually aspected, or such as be of
Venus' complexion. <a href="#note4762">[4762]</a>Plutarch interprets astrologically that tale of
Mars and Venus, <q>in whose genitures &#x2642; and &#x2642; are in conjunction,</q>
they are commonly lascivious, and if women queans; as the good wife of
Bath confessed in Chaucer;
<div class="blackletter">
<div class="line">I followed aye mine inclination,</div>

</div>
But of all those astrological aphorisms which I have ever read, that of
Cardan is most memorable, for which howsoever he is bitterly censured by
<a href="#note4763">[4763]</a>Marinus Marcennus, a malapert friar, and some others (which <a href="#note4764">[4764]</a>
he himself suspected) yet methinks it is free, downright, plain and
ingenious. In his <a href="#note4765">[4765]</a>eighth <span class="cite">Geniture</span>, or example, he hath these words
of himself, &#x2642; &#x2642; and &#x263F; in &#x263F; <span lang="la">dignitatibus

and for this he is traduced by Marcennus, when as in effect he saith no
more than what Gregory Nazianzen of old, to Chilo his scholar, <span lang="la">offerebant

freed; though many are of opinion flatuous or hypochondriacal melancholy
are most subject of all others to this infirmity. Valescus assigns their
strong imagination for a cause, Bodine abundance of wind, Gordonius of
seed, and spirits, or atomi in the seed, which cause their violent and
furious passions. Sanguine thence are soon caught, young folks most apt to
love, and by their good wills, saith <a href="#note4767">[4767]</a>Lucian, <q>would have a bout with
every one they see:</q> the colt's evil is common to all complexions.
Theomestus a young and lusty gallant acknowledgeth (in the said author) all
this to be verified in him, <q>I am so amorously given, <a href="#note4768">[4768]</a>you may sooner
number the sea-sands, and snow falling from the skies, than my several
loves. Cupid had shot all his arrows at me, I am deluded with various
desires, one love succeeds another, and that so soon, that before one is
ended, I begin with a second; she that is last is still fairest, and she
that is present pleaseth me most: as an hydra's head my loves increase, no
Iolaus can help me. Mine eyes are so moist a refuge and sanctuary of love,
that they draw all beauties to them, and are never satisfied. I am in a
doubt what fury of Venus this should be: alas, how have I offended her so
to vex me, what Hippolitus am I!</q> What Telchine is my genius? or is it a
natural imperfection, an hereditary passion? Another in <a href="#note4769">[4769]</a>Anacreon
confesseth that he had twenty sweethearts in Athens at once, fifteen at
Corinth, as many at Thebes, at Lesbos, and at Rhodes, twice as many in

<p>His eyes are like a balance, apt to propend each way, and to be weighed
down with every wench's looks, his heart a weathercock, his affection
tinder, or naphtha itself, which every fair object, sweet smile, or
mistress's favour sets on fire. Guianerius <span class="cite">tract 15. cap. 14.</span> refers all
this <a href="#note4770">[4770]</a>to <q>the hot temperature of the testicles,</q> Ferandus a Frenchman

commentator translates it: for which cause these young men that be strong

same words in effect. But most part I say, such as are aptest to love that
are young and lusty, live at ease, stall-fed, free from cares, like cattle
in a rank pasture, idle and solitary persons, they must needs

The place itself makes much wherein we live, the clime, air, and discipline
if they concur. In our Misnia, saith Galen, near to Pergamus, thou shalt
scarce find an adulterer, but many at Rome, by reason of the delights of
the seat. It was that plenty of all things, which made <a href="#note4773">[4773]</a>Corinth so
infamous of old, and the opportunity of the place to entertain those
foreign comers; every day strangers came in, at each gate, from all
quarters. In that one temple of Venus a thousand whores did prostitute
themselves, as Strabo writes, besides Lais and the rest of better note: all
nations resorted thither, as to a school of Venus. Your hot and southern
countries are prone to lust, and far more incontinent than those that live
in the north, as Bodine discourseth at large, <span class="cite">Method, hist. cap. 5.</span> <span lang="la">Molles
Asiatici</span>, so are Turks, Greeks, Spaniards, Italians, even all that
latitude; and in those tracts, such as are more fruitful, plentiful, and
delicious, as Valence in Spain, Capua in Italy, <span lang="la">domicilium luxus</span> Tully
terms it, and (which Hannibal's soldiers can witness) Canopus in Egypt,
Sybaris, Phoeacia, Baiae, <a href="#note4774">[4774]</a>Cyprus, Lampsacus. In <a href="#note4775">[4775]</a>Naples the
fruit of the soil and pleasant air enervate their bodies, and alter
constitutions: insomuch that Florus calls it <span lang="la">Certamen Bacchi et Veneris</span>,
but <a href="#note4776">[4776]</a>Foliot admires it. In Italy and Spain they have their stews in
every great city, as in Rome, Venice, Florence, wherein, some say, dwell
ninety thousand inhabitants, of which ten thousand are courtesans; and yet
for all this, every gentleman almost hath a peculiar mistress;
fornications, adulteries, are nowhere so common: <span lang="la">urbs est jam tota
lupanar</span>; how should a man live honest amongst so many provocations? now if
vigour of youth, greatness, liberty I mean, and that impunity of sin which
grandees take unto themselves in this kind shall meet, what a gap must it
needs open to all manner of vice, with what fury will it rage? For, as
Maximus Tyrius the Platonist observes, <span lang="la">libido consequuta quum fuerit
materiam improbam et praeruptam licentiam, et effrenatam audaciam</span>, &amp;c.,
what will not lust effect in such persons? For commonly princes and great
men make no scruple at all of such matters, but with that whore in
Spartian, <span lang="la">quicquid libet licet</span>, they think they may do what they list,
profess it publicly, and rather brag with Proculus (that writ to a friend
of his in Rome, <a href="#note4777">[4777]</a>what famous exploits he had done in that kind) than
any way be abashed at it. <a href="#note4778">[4778]</a>Nicholas Sanders relates of Henry VIII. (I
know not how truly) <span lang="la">Quod paucas vidit pulchriores quas non concupierit, et
paucissimas non concupierit quas non violarit</span>, <q>He saw very few maids that
he did not desire, and desired fewer whom he did not enjoy:</q> nothing so
familiar amongst them, 'tis most of their business: Sardanapalus,
Messalina, and Joan of Naples, are not comparable to <a href="#note4779">[4779]</a>meaner men and
women; Solomon of old had a thousand concubines; Ahasuerus his eunuchs and
keepers; Nero his Tigillinus panders, and bawds; the Turks, <a href="#note4780">[4780]</a>
Muscovites, Mogors, Xeriffs of Barbary, and Persian Sophies, are no whit
inferior to them in our times. <span lang="la">Delectus fit omnium puellarum toto regno
forma praestantiorum</span> (saith Jovius) <span lang="la">pro imperatore; et quas ille linquit,
nobiles habent</span>; they press and muster up wenches as we do soldiers, and
have their choice of the rarest beauties their countries can afford, and yet
all this cannot keep them from adultery, incest, sodomy, buggery, and such
prodigious lusts. We may conclude, that if they be young, fortunate, rich,
high-fed, and idle withal, it is almost impossible that they should live
honest, not rage, and precipitate themselves into these inconveniences of
burning lust.

therefore did well to feign all shepherds lovers, to give themselves to
songs and dalliances, because they lived such idle lives. For love, as
<a href="#note4786">[4786]</a>Theophrastus defines it, is <span lang="la">otiosi animi affectus</span>, an affection of
an idle mind, or as <a href="#note4787">[4787]</a>Seneca describes it, <span lang="la">Juventa gignitur, juxu

Gordonius the physician <span class="cite">cap. 20. part. 2.</span> call this disease the proper
passion of nobility. Now if a weak judgment and a strong apprehension do
concur, how, saith Hercules de Saxonia, shall they resist? Savanarola
appropriates it almost to <a href="#note4789">[4789]</a><q>monks, friars, and religious persons,
because they live solitarily, fair daintily, and do nothing:</q> and well he
may, for how should they otherwise choose?

<p>Diet alone is able to cause it: a rare thing to see a young man or a woman
that lives idly and fares well, of what condition soever, not to be in
love. <a href="#note4790">[4790]</a>Alcibiades was still dallying with wanton young women,
immoderate in his expenses, effeminate in his apparel, ever in love, but
why? he was over-delicate in his diet, too frequent and excessive in
banquets, <span lang="la">Ubicunque securitas, ibi libido dominatur</span>; lust and security
domineer together, as St. Hierome averreth. All which the wife of Bath in

<h4><a name="3.2.2.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Other causes of Love-Melancholy, Sight, Being from the Face, Eyes, other parts, and how it pierceth</i>.</h4>

<p>Many such causes may be reckoned up, but they cannot avail, except
opportunity be offered of time, place, and those other beautiful objects,
or artificial enticements, as kissing, conference, discourse, gestures
concur, with such like lascivious provocations. Kornmannus, in his book <span class="cite">de
linea amoris</span>, makes five degrees of lust, out of <a href="#note4805">[4805]</a>Lucian belike,
which he handles in five chapters, <span lang="la">Visus, Colloquium, Convictus, Oscula,
Tactus</span>. <a href="#note4806">[4806]</a>Sight, of all other, is the first step of this unruly love,
though sometime it be prevented by relation or hearing, or rather incensed.
For there be those so apt, credulous, and facile to love, that if they hear
of a proper man, or woman, they are in love before they see them, and that
merely by relation, as Achilles Tatius observes. <a href="#note4807">[4807]</a><q>Such is their
intemperance and lust, that they are as much maimed by report, as if they
saw them. Callisthenes a rich young gentleman of Byzance in Thrace, hearing
of <a href="#note4808">[4808]</a>Leucippe, Sostratus' fair daughter, was far in love with her,
and, out of fame and common rumour, so much incensed, that he would needs
have her to be his wife.</q> And sometimes by reading they are so affected, as
he in <a href="#note4809">[4809]</a>Lucian confesseth of himself, <q>I never read that place of
Panthea in Xenophon, but I am as much affected as if I were present with
her.</q> Such persons commonly <a href="#note4810">[4810]</a>feign a kind of beauty to themselves;
and so did those three gentlewomen in <a href="#note4811">[4811]</a>Balthazar Castilio fall in
love with a young man whom they never knew, but only heard him commended:
or by reading of a letter; for there is a grace cometh from hearing, <a href="#note4812">[4812]</a>
as a moral philosopher informeth us, <q>as well from sight; and the species
of love are received into the fantasy by relation alone:</q> <a href="#note4813">[4813]</a><span lang="la">ut cupere
ab aspectu, sic velle ab auditu</span>, both senses affect. <span lang="la">Interdum et absentes
amamus</span>, sometimes we love those that are absent, saith Philostratus, and
gives instance in his friend Athenodorus, that loved a maid at Corinth whom
he never saw; <span lang="la">non oculi sed mens videt</span>, we see with the eyes of our
understanding.

<p>But the most familiar and usual cause of love is that which comes by sight,
which conveys those admirable rays of beauty and pleasing graces to the
heart. Plotinus derives love from sight, <span lang="gr">&#x1F14;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> quasi
<span lang="gr">&#x1F45;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>. <a href="#note4814">[4814]</a><span lang="la">Si nescis, oculi sunt in amore duces</span>, <q>the eyes are the
harbingers of love,</q> and the first step of love is sight, as <a href="#note4815">[4815]</a>Lilius
Giraldus proves at large, <span class="cite">hist. deor. syntag. 13.</span> they as two sluices let
in the influences of that divine, powerful, soul-ravishing, and captivating
beauty, which, as <a href="#note4816">[4816]</a>one saith, <q>is sharper than any dart or needle,
wounds deeper into the heart; and opens a gap through our eyes to that
lovely wound, which pierceth the soul itself</q> (<span class="bibcite">Ecclus. 18.</span>) Through it love
is kindled like a fire. This amazing, confounding, admirable, amiable
beauty, <a href="#note4817">[4817]</a><q>than which in all nature's treasure (saith Isocrates) there
is nothing so majestical and sacred, nothing so divine, lovely, precious,</q>
'tis nature's crown, gold and glory; <span lang="la">bonum si non summum, de summis tamen
non infrequenter triumphans</span>, whose power hence may be discerned; we
contemn and abhor generally such things as are foul and ugly to behold,
account them filthy, but love and covet that which is fair. 'Tis <a href="#note4818">[4818]</a>
beauty in all things which pleaseth and allureth us, a fair hawk, a fine
garment, a goodly building, a fair house, &amp;c. That Persian Xerxes when he
destroyed all those temples of the gods in Greece, caused that of Diana,
<span lang="la">in integrum servari</span>, to be spared alone for that excellent beauty and
magnificence of it. Inanimate beauty can so command. 'Tis that which
painters, artificers, orators, all aim at, as Eriximachus the physician, in
Plato contends, <a href="#note4819">[4819]</a><q>It was beauty first that ministered occasion to
art, to find out the knowledge of carving, painting, building, to find out
models, perspectives, rich furnitures, and so many rare inventions.</q>
Whiteness in the lily, red in the rose, purple in the violet, a lustre in
all things without life, the clear light of the moon, the bright beams of
the sun, splendour of gold, purple, sparkling diamond, the excellent
feature of the horse, the majesty of the lion, the colour of birds,
peacock's tails, the silver scales of fish, we behold with singular delight
and admiration. <a href="#note4820">[4820]</a><q>And which is rich in plants, delightful in flowers,
wonderful in beasts, but most glorious in men,</q> doth make us affect and
earnestly desire it, as when we hear any sweet harmony, an eloquent tongue,
see any excellent quality, curious work of man, elaborate art, or aught
that is exquisite, there ariseth instantly in us a longing for the same. We
love such men, but most part for comeliness of person, we call them gods
and goddesses, divine, serene, happy, &amp;c. And of all mortal men they alone
(<a href="#note4821">[4821]</a>Calcagninus holds) are free from calumny; <span lang="la">qui divitiis, magistratu
et gloria florent, injuria lacessimus</span>, we backbite, wrong, hate renowned,
rich, and happy men, we repine at their felicity, they are undeserving we
think, fortune is a stepmother to us, a parent to them. <q>We envy</q> (saith
<a href="#note4822">[4822]</a>Isocrates) <q>wise, just, honest men, except with mutual offices and
kindnesses, some good turn or other, they extort this love from us; only
fair persons we love at first sight, desire their acquaintance, and adore
them as so many gods: we had rather serve them than command others, and
account ourselves the more beholding to them, the more service they enjoin
us:</q> though they be otherwise vicious, dishonest, we love them, favour them,
and are ready to do them any good office for their <a href="#note4823">[4823]</a>beauty's sake,
though they have no other good quality beside. <span lang="la">Dic igitur o fomose,
adolescens</span> (as that eloquent Phavorinus breaks out in <a href="#note4824">[4824]</a>Stobeus) <span lang="la">dic
Autiloque, suavius nectare loqueris; dic o Telemache, vehementius Ulysse
dicis; dic Alcibiades utcunque ebrius, libentius tibi licet ebrio
auscultabimus</span>. <q>Speak, fair youth, speak Autiloquus, thy words are sweeter
than nectar, speak O Telemachus, thou art more powerful than Ulysses, speak
Alcibiades though drunk, we will willingly hear thee as thou art.</q> Faults
in such are no faults: for when the said Alcibiades had stolen Anytus his
gold and silver plate, he was so far from prosecuting so foul a fact
(though every man else condemned his impudence and insolency) that he
wished it had been more, and much better (he loved him dearly) for his
sweet sake. <q>No worth is eminent in such lovely persons, all imperfections
hid;</q> <span lang="la">non enim facile de his quos plurimum diligimus, turpitudinem
suspicamur</span>, for hearing, sight, touch, &amp;c., our mind and all our senses
are captivated, <span lang="la">omnes sensus formosus delectat</span>. Many men have been
preferred for their person alone, chosen kings, as amongst the Indians,
Persians, Ethiopians of old; the properest man of person the country could
afford, was elected their sovereign lord; <span lang="la">Gratior est pulchro veniens e
corpore virtus</span>, <a href="#note4825">[4825]</a>and so have many other nations thought and done, as
<a href="#note4826">[4826]</a>Curtius observes: <span lang="la">Ingens enim in corporis majestate veneratio est</span>,
<q>for there is a majestical presence in such men;</q> and so far was beauty
adored amongst them, that no man was thought fit to reign, that was not in
all parts complete and supereminent. Agis, king of Lacedaemon, had like to
have been deposed, because he married a little wife, they would not have
their royal issue degenerate. Who would ever have thought that Adrian' the
Fourth, an English monk's bastard (as <a href="#note4827">[4827]</a>Papirius Massovius writes in
his life), <span lang="la">inops a suis relectus, squalidus et miser</span>, a poor forsaken
child, should ever come to be pope of Rome? But why was it? <span lang="la">Erat acri
ingenio, facundia expedita eleganti corpore, facieque laeta ac hilari</span>, (as
he follows it out of <a href="#note4828">[4828]</a>Nubrigensis, for he ploughs with his heifer,)
<q>he was wise, learned, eloquent, of a pleasant, a promising countenance, a
goodly, proper man; he had, in a word, a winning look of his own,</q> and that
carried it, for that he was especially advanced. So <q>Saul was a goodly
person and a fair.</q> Maximinus elected emperor, &amp;c. Branchus the son of
Apollo, whom he begot of Jance, Succron's daughter (saith Lactantius), when
he kept King Admetus' herds in Thessaly, now grown a man, was an earnest
suitor to his mother to know his father; the nymph denied him, because
Apollo had conjured her to the contrary; yet overcome by his importunity at
last she sent him to his father; when he came into Apollo's presence,
<span lang="la">malas Dei reverenter osculatus</span>, he carried himself so well, and was so
fair a young man, that Apollo was infinitely taken with the beauty of his
person, he could scarce look off him, and said he was worthy of such
parents, gave him a crown of gold, the spirit of divination, and in
conclusion made him a demigod. <span lang="la">O vis superba formae</span>, a goddess beauty is,
whom the very gods adore, <span lang="la">nam pulchros dii amant</span>; she is <span lang="la">Amoris domina</span>,
love's harbinger, love's loadstone, a witch, a charm, &amp;c. Beauty is a dower
of itself, a sufficient patrimony, an ample commendation, an accurate
epistle, as <a href="#note4829">[4829]</a>Lucian, <a href="#note4830">[4830]</a>Apuleius, Tiraquellus, and some others
conclude. <span lang="la">Imperio digna forma</span>, beauty deserves a kingdom, saith
Abulensis, <span class="cite">paradox. 2. cap. 110.</span> immortality; and <a href="#note4831">[4831]</a><q>more have got
this honour and eternity for their beauty, than for all other virtues
besides:</q> and such as are fair, <q>are worthy to be honoured of God and men.</q>
That Idalian Ganymede was therefore fetched by Jupiter into heaven,
Hephaestion dear to Alexander, Antinous to Adrian. Plato calls beauty for
that cause a privilege of nature, <span lang="la">Naturae gaudentis opus</span>, nature's
masterpiece, a dumb comment; Theophrastus, a silent fraud; still rhetoric
Carneades, that persuades without speech, a kingdom without a guard,
because beautiful persons command as so many captains; Socrates, a tyranny,
<q>which tyranniseth over tyrants themselves;</q> which made Diogenes belike call
proper women queens, <span lang="la">quod facerent homines quae praeciperent</span>, because men
were so obedient to their commands. They will adore, cringe, compliment,
and bow to a common wench (if she be fair) as if she were a noble woman, a
countess, a queen, or a goddess. Those intemperate young men of Greece
erected at Delphos a golden image with infinite cost, to the eternal memory
of Phryne the courtesan, as Aelian relates, for she was a most beautiful
woman, insomuch, saith <a href="#note4832">[4832]</a>Athenaeus, that Apelles and Praxiteles drew
Venus's picture from her. Thus young men will adore and honour beauty; nay
kings themselves I say will do it, and voluntarily submit their sovereignty
to a lovely woman. <q>Wine is strong, kings are strong, but a woman
strongest,</q> <span class="bibcite">1 Esd. iv. 10.</span> as Zerobabel proved at large to King Darius, his
princes and noblemen. <q>Kings sit still and command sea and land, &amp;c., all
pay tribute to the king; but women make kings pay tribute, and have
dominion over them. When they have got gold and silver, they submit all to
a beautiful woman, give themselves wholly to her, gape and gaze on her, and
all men desire her more than gold or silver, or any precious thing: they
will leave father and mother, and venture their lives for her, labour and
travel to get, and bring all their gains to women, steal, fight, and spoil
for their mistress's sake. And no king so strong, but a fair woman is
stronger than he is. All things</q> (as <a href="#note4833">[4833]</a>he proceeds) <q>fear to touch the
king; yet I saw him and Apame his concubine, the daughter of the famous
Bartacus, sitting on the right hand of the king, and she took the crown off
his head, and put it on her own, and stroke him with her left hand; yet the
king gaped and gazed on her, and when she laughed he laughed, and when she
was angry he flattered to be reconciled to her.</q> So beauty commands even
kings themselves; nay whole armies and kingdoms are captivated together
with their kings: <a href="#note4834">[4834]</a><span lang="la">Forma vincit armatos, ferrum pulchritudo
captivat; vincentur specie, qui non vincentur proelio</span>. And 'tis a great
matter saith <a href="#note4835">[4835]</a>Xenophon, <q>and of which all fair persons may worthily
brag, that a strong man must labour for his living if he will have aught, a
valiant man must fight and endanger himself for it, a wise man speak, show
himself, and toil; but a fair and beautiful person doth all with ease, he
compasseth his desire without any pains-taking:</q> God and men, heaven and
earth conspire to honour him; every one pities him above other, if he be in
need, <a href="#note4836">[4836]</a>and all the world is willing to do him good. <a href="#note4837">[4837]</a>Chariclea
fell into the hand of pirates, but when all the rest were put to the edge
of the sword, she alone was preserved for her person. <a href="#note4838">[4838]</a>When
Constantinople was sacked by the Turk, Irene escaped, and was so far from
being made a captive, that she even captivated the Grand Signior himself.
So did Rosamond insult over King Henry the Second.

<span lang="la">Formosam Barbari verentur, et ad spectum pulchrum immanis animus
mansuescit</span>. (Heliodor. <span class="cite">lib. 5.</span>) The barbarians stand in awe of a fair
woman, and at a beautiful aspect a fierce spirit is pacified. For when as
Troy was taken, and the wars ended (as Clemens <a href="#note4842">[4842]</a>Alexandrinus quotes
out of Euripides) angry Menelaus with rage and fury armed, came with his
sword drawn, to have killed Helen, with his own hands, as being the sole
cause of all those wars and miseries: but when he saw her fair face, as one
amazed at her divine beauty, he let his weapon fall, and embraced her
besides, he had no power to strike so sweet a creature. <span lang="la">Ergo habetantur
enses pulchritudine</span>, the edge of a sharp sword (as the saying is) is
dulled with a beautiful aspect, and severity itself is overcome. Hiperides
the orator, when Phryne his client was accused at Athens for her lewdness,
used no other defence in her cause, but tearing her upper garment,
disclosed her naked breast to the judges, with which comeliness of her body
and amiable gesture they were so moved and astonished, that they did acquit
her forthwith, and let her go. O noble piece of justice! mine author
exclaims: and who is he that would not rather lose his seat and robes,
forfeit his office, than give sentence against the majesty of beauty? Such
prerogatives have fair persons, and they alone are free from danger.
Parthenopaeus was so lovely and fair, that when he fought in the Theban
wars, if his face had been by chance bare, no enemy would offer to strike
at or hurt him, such immunities hath beauty. Beasts themselves are moved
with it. Sinalda was a woman of such excellent feature, <a href="#note4843">[4843]</a>and a queen,
that when she was to be trodden on by wild horses for a punishment, <q>the
wild beasts stood in admiration of her person,</q> (Saxo Grammaticus <span class="cite">lib. 8.
Dan. hist.</span>) <q>and would not hurt her.</q> Wherefore did that royal virgin in
<a href="#note4844">[4844]</a>Apuleius, when she fled from the thieves' den, in a desert, make
such an apostrophe to her ass on whom she rode; (for what knew she to the
contrary, but that he was an ass?) <span lang="la">Si me parentibus et proco formoso
reddideris, quas, tibi gratias, quos honores habebo, quos cibos exhibebo</span>?
<a href="#note4845">[4845]</a>She would comb him, dress him, feed him, and trick him every day
herself, and he should work no more, toil no more, but rest and play, &amp;c.
And besides she would have a dainty picture drawn, in perpetual
remembrance, a virgin riding upon an ass's back with this motto, <span lang="la">Asino
vectore regia virgo fugiens captivitatem</span>; why said she all this? why did
she make such promises to a dumb beast? but that she perceived the poor ass
to be taken with her beauty, for he did often <span lang="la">obliquo collo pedes puellae
decoros basiare</span>, kiss her feet as she rode, <span lang="la">et ad delicatulas voculas
tentabat adhinnire</span>, offer to give consent as much as in him was to her
delicate speeches, and besides he had some feeling, as she conceived of her
misery. And why did Theogine's horse in Heliodorus <a href="#note4846">[4846]</a>curvet, prance,
and go so proudly, <span lang="la">exultans alacriter et superbiens</span>, &amp;c., but that such
as mine author supposeth, he was in love with his master? <span lang="la">dixisses ipsum
equum pulchrum intelligere pulchram domini fomam</span>? A fly lighted on <a href="#note4847">[4847]</a>
Malthius' cheek as he lay asleep; but why? Not to hurt him, as a parasite
of his, standing by, well perceived, <span lang="la">non ut pungeret, sed ut oscularetur</span>,
but certainly to kiss him, as ravished with his divine looks. Inanimate
creatures, I suppose, have a touch of this. When a drop of <a href="#note4848">[4848]</a>Psyche's
candle fell on Cupid's shoulder, I think sure it was to kiss it. When Venus
ran to meet her rose-cheeked Adonis, as an elegant <a href="#note4849">[4849]</a>poet of our's
sets her out,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;the bushes in the way</div>
<div class="line">Some catch her neck, some kiss her face,</div>
<div class="line">Some twine about her legs to make her stay,</div>
<div class="line">And all did covet her for to embrace.</div>
</div>
<a name="index9"></a><span lang="la">Aer ipse amore inficitur</span>, as Heliodorus holds, the air itself is in love:
for when Hero plaid upon her lute,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4850">[4850]</a>The wanton air in twenty sweet forms danc't</div>
<div class="line">After her fingers&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
and those lascivious winds stayed Daphne when she fled from Apollo;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4851">[4851]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;nudabant corpora venti,</div>
<div class="line">Obviaque adversas vibrabant flamina vestes.</div>
</div>
Boreas Ventus loved Hyacinthus, and Orithya Ericthons's daughter of Athens:
<span lang="la">vi rapuit</span>, &amp;c. he took her away by force, as she was playing with other
wenches at Ilissus, and begat Zetes and Galias his two sons of her. That
seas and waters are enamoured with this our beauty, is all out as likely as
that of the air and winds; for when Leander swam in the Hellespont, Neptune
with his trident did beat down the waves, but
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">They still mounted up intending to have kiss'd him.</div>
<div class="line">And fell in drops like tears because they missed him.</div>
</div>
The <a href="#note4852">[4852]</a>river Alpheus was in love with Arethusa, as she tells the tale
herself,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4853">[4853]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;viridesque manu siccata capillos,</div>
<div class="line">Fluminis Alphei veteres recitavit amores;</div>
<div class="line">Pars ego Nympharum, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
When our Thame and Isis meet
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4854">[4854]</a>Oscula mille sonant, connexu brachia pallent,</div>
<div class="line">Mutuaque explicitis connectunt colla lacertis.</div>
</div>
Inachus and Pineus, and how many loving rivers can I reckon up, whom beauty
hath enthralled! I say nothing all this while of idols themselves that have
committed idolatry in this kind, of looking-glasses, that have been rapt in
love (if you will believe <a href="#note4855">[4855]</a>poets), when their ladies and mistresses
looked on to dress them.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Et si non habeo sensum, tua gratia sensum</div>
<div class="line">Exhibet, et calidi sentio amoris onus.</div>
<div class="line">Dirigis huc quoties spectantia lumina, flamma</div>

</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Though I no sense at all of feeling have.</div>
<div class="line">Yet your sweet looks do animate and save;</div>

<div class="line">Methinks my wounded members live and burn.</div>
</div>
I could tell you such another story of a spindle that was fired by a fair
lady's <a href="#note4856">[4856]</a>looks, or fingers, some say, I know not well whether, but
fired it was by report, and of a cold bath that suddenly smoked, and was
very hot when naked Coelia came into it, <span lang="la">Miramur quis sit tantus et unde
vapor</span>, <a href="#note4857">[4857]</a>&amp;c. But of all the tales in this kind, that is the most
memorable of <a href="#note4858">[4858]</a>Death himself, when he should have strucken a sweet
young virgin with his dart, he fell in love with the object. Many more such
could I relate which are to be believed with a poetical faith. So dumb and
dead creatures dote, but men are mad, stupefied many times at the first
sight of beauty, amazed, <a href="#note4859">[4859]</a>as that fisherman in Aristaenetus that spied
a maid bathing herself by the seaside,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4860">[4860]</a>Soluta mihi sunt omnia membra&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">A capite ad calcem. sensusque omnis periit</div>
<div class="line">De pectore, tam immensus stupor animam invasit mihi.</div>
</div>
And as <a href="#note4861">[4861]</a>Lucian, in his images, confesses of himself, that he was at
his mistress's presence void of all sense, immovable, as if he had seen a
Gorgon's head: which was no such cruel monster (as <a href="#note4862">[4862]</a>Coelius
interprets it, <span class="cite">lib. 3. cap. 9.</span>), <q>but the very quintessence of beauty,</q>
some fair creature, as without doubt the poet understood in the first
fiction of it, at which the spectators were amazed. <a href="#note4863">[4863]</a><span lang="la">Miseri quibus
intentata nites</span>, poor wretches are compelled at the very sight of her
ravishing looks to run mad, or make away with themselves.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

<div class="line">And whom she favours lives, the other dies.</div>
</div>
4865]Heliodorus, <span class="cite">lib. 1.</span> brings in Thyamis almost besides himself, when
he saw Chariclia first, and not daring to look upon her a second time, <q>for
he thought it impossible for any man living to see her and contain
himself.</q> The very fame of beauty will fetch them to it many miles off
(such an attractive power this loadstone hath), and they will seem but
short, they will undertake any toil or trouble, <a href="#note4866">[4866]</a>long journeys. Penia
or Atalanta shall not overgo them, through seas, deserts, mountains, and
dangerous places, as they did to gaze on Psyche: <q>many mortal men came far
and near to see that glorious object of her age,</q> Paris for Helena, Corebus
to Troja.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Illis Trojam qui forte diebus</div>

<q>who inflamed with a violent passion for Cassandra, happened then to be in
Troy.</q> King John of France, once prisoner in England, came to visit his old
friends again, crossing the seas; but the truth is, his coming was to see
the Countess of Salisbury, the nonpareil of those times, and his dear
mistress. That infernal God Pluto came from hell itself, to steal
Proserpine; Achilles left all his friends for Polixena's sake, his enemy's
daughter; and all the <a href="#note4867">[4867]</a>Graecian gods forsook their heavenly mansions
for that fair lady, Philo Dioneus daughter's sake, the paragon of Greece in
those days; <span lang="la">ea enim venustate fuit, ut eam certatim omnes dii conjugem
expeterent</span>: <q>for she was of such surpassing beauty, that all the gods
contended for her love.</q> <a href="#note4868">[4868]</a><span lang="la">Formosa divis imperat puella</span>. <q>The
beautiful maid commands the gods.</q> They will not only come to see, but as a

When fair <a href="#note4869">[4869]</a>Hero came abroad, the eyes, hearts, and affections of her
spectators were still attendant on her.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4870">[4870]</a>Et medios inter vultus supereminet omnes,</div>
<div class="line">Perque urbem aspiciunt venientem numinis instar.</div>

<div class="line">And stole away the enchanted gazer's mind.</div>
</div>
<a href="#note4872">[4872]</a>When Peter Aretine's Lucretia came first to Rome, and that the fame
of her beauty, <span lang="la">ad urbanarum deliciarum sectatores venerat, nemo non ad
videndam eam</span>, &amp;c. was spread abroad, they came in (as they say) thick and
threefold to see her, and hovered about her gates, as they did of old to
Lais of Corinth, and Phryne of Thebes, <a href="#note4873">[4873]</a><span lang="la">Ad cujus jacuit Graecia tota
fores</span>, <q>at whose gates lay all Greece.</q> <a href="#note4874">[4874]</a><q>Every man sought to get
her love, some with gallant and costly apparel, some with an affected pace,
some with music, others with rich gifts, pleasant discourse, multitude of
followers; others with letters, vows, and promises, to commend themselves,
and to be gracious in her eyes.</q> Happy was he that could see her, thrice
happy that enjoyed her company. Charmides <a href="#note4875">[4875]</a>in Plato was a proper
young man in comeliness of person, <q>and all good qualities, far exceeding
others; whensoever fair Charmides came abroad, they seemed all to be in
love with him</q> (as Critias describes their carriage), <q>and were troubled at
the very sight of him; many came near him, many followed him wheresoever he
went,</q> as those <a href="#note4876">[4876]</a><span lang="la">formarum spectatores</span> did Acontius, if at any time
he walked abroad: the Athenian lasses stared on Alcibiades; Sappho and the
Mitilenean women on Phaon the fair. Such lovely sights do not only please,
entice, but ravish and amaze. Cleonimus, a delicate and tender youth,
present at a feast which Androcles his uncle made in Piraeo at Athens, when
he sacrificed to Mercury, so stupefied the guests, Dineas, Aristippus,
Agasthenes, and the rest (as Charidemus in <a href="#note4877">[4877]</a>Lucian relates it), that
they could not eat their meat, they sat all supper time gazing, glancing at
him, stealing looks, and admiring of his beauty. Many will condemn these
men that are so enamoured, for fools; but some again commend them for it;
many reject Paris's judgment, and yet Lucian approves of it, admiring Paris
for his choice; he would have done as much himself, and by good desert in
his mind: beauty is to be preferred <a href="#note4878">[4878]</a><q>before wealth or wisdom.</q>
<a href="#note4879">[4879]</a>Athenaeus <span class="cite">Deipnosophist, lib. 13. cap. 7</span>, holds it not such
indignity for the Trojans and Greeks to contend ten years, to spend so much
labour, lose so many men's lives for Helen's sake, <a href="#note4880">[4880]</a>for so fair a
lady's sake,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Ob talem uxorem cui praestantissima forma,</div>
<div class="line">Nil mortale refert.</div>
</div>
That one woman was worth a kingdom, a hundred thousand other women, a world
itself. Well might <a href="#note4881">[4881]</a>Sterpsichores be blind for carping at so fair a
creature, and a just punishment it was. The same testimony gives Homer of
the old men of Troy, that were spectators of that single combat between
Paris and Menelaus at the Seian gate, when Helen stood in presence; they
said all, the war was worthily prolonged and undertaken <a href="#note4882">[4882]</a>for her
sake. The very gods themselves (as Homer and <a href="#note4883">[4883]</a>Isocrates record)
fought more for Helen, than they did against the giants. When <a href="#note4884">[4884]</a>Venus
lost her son Cupid, she made proclamation by Mercury, that he that could
bring tidings of him should have seven kisses; a noble reward some say, and
much better than so many golden talents; seven such kisses to many men were
more precious than seven cities, or so many provinces. One such a kiss
alone would recover a man if he were a dying, <a href="#note4885">[4885]</a><span lang="la">Suaviolum Stygia sic
te de valle reducet</span>, &amp;c. Great Alexander married Roxanne, a poor man's
child, only for her person. <a href="#note4886">[4886]</a>'Twas well done of Alexander, and
heroically done; I admire him for it. Orlando was mad for Angelica, and who
doth not condole his mishap? Thisbe died for Pyramus, Dido for Aeneas; who
doth not weep, as (before his conversion) <a href="#note4887">[4887]</a>Austin did in
commiseration of her estate! she died for him; <q>methinks</q> (as he said) <q>I
could die for her.</q>

<p>But this is not the matter in hand; what prerogative this beauty hath, of
what power and sovereignty it is, and how far such persons that so much
admire, and dote upon it, are to be justified; no man doubts of these
matters; the question is, how and by what means beauty produceth this
effect? By sight: the eye betrays the soul, and is both active and passive
in this business; it wounds and is wounded, is an especial cause and
instrument, both in the subject and in the object. <a href="#note4888">[4888]</a><q>As tears, it
begins in the eyes, descends to the breast;</q> it conveys these beauteous
rays, as I have said, unto the heart. <span lang="la">Ut vidi ut perii.</span> <a href="#note4889">[4889]</a><span lang="la">Mars
videt hanc, visamque cupit.</span> Schechem saw Dinah the daughter of Leah, and
defiled her, <span class="bibcite">Gen. xxxiv. 3</span>. Jacob, Rachel, <span class="bibcite">xxix. 17</span>, <q>for she was beautiful
and fair.</q> David spied Bathsheba afar off, <span class="bibcite">2 Sam. xi. 2.</span> The Elders,
Susanna, <a href="#note4890">[4890]</a>as that Orthomenian Strato saw fair Aristoclea daughter of
Theophanes, bathing herself at that Hercyne well in Lebadea, and were
captivated in an instant. <span lang="la">Viderunt oculi, rapuerunt pectora flammae</span>; Ammon
fell sick for Thamar's sake, <span class="bibcite">2 Sam. xiii. 2.</span> The beauty of Esther was such,
that she found favour not only in the sight of Ahasuerus, <q>but of all those
that looked upon her.</q> Gerson, Origen, and some others, contended that
Christ himself was the fairest of the sons of men, and Joseph next unto
him, <span lang="la">speciosus prae filiis hominum</span>, and they will have it literally taken;
his very person was such, that he found grace and favour of all those that
looked upon him. Joseph was so fair, that, as the ordinary gloss hath it,
<span lang="la">filiae decurrerent per murum, et ad fenestras</span>, they ran to the top of the
walls and to the windows to gaze on him, as we do commonly to see some
great personage go by: and so Matthew Paris describes Matilda the Empress
going through Cullen. <a href="#note4891">[4891]</a>P. Morales the Jesuit saith as much of the
Virgin Mary. Antony no sooner saw Cleopatra, but, saith Appian, <span class="cite">lib. 1</span>,
he was enamoured of her. <a href="#note4892">[4892]</a>Theseus at the first sight of Helen was so
besotted, that he esteemed himself the happiest man in the world if he
might enjoy her, and to that purpose kneeled down, and made his pathetical
prayers unto the gods. <a href="#note4893">[4893]</a>Charicles, by chance, espying that curious
picture of smiling Venus naked in her temple, stood a great while gazing,
as one amazed; at length, he brake into that mad passionate speech, <q>O
fortunate god Mars, that wast bound in chains, and made ridiculous for her
sake!</q> He could not contain himself, but kissed her picture, I know not how
oft, and heartily desired to be so disgraced as Mars was. And what did he
that his betters had not done before him?

When Venus came first to heaven, her comeliness was such, that (as mine
author saith) <a href="#note4895">[4895]</a><q>all the gods came flocking about, and saluted her,
each of them went to Jupiter, and desired he might have her to be his
wife.</q> When fair <a href="#note4896">[4896]</a>Antilochus came in presence, as a candle in the
dark his beauty shined, all men's eyes (as Xenophon describes the manner of
it) <q>were instantly fixed on him, and moved at the sight, insomuch that
they could not conceal themselves, but in gesture or looks it was discerned
and expressed.</q> Those other senses, hearing, touching, may much penetrate
and affect, but none so much, none so forcible as sight. <span lang="la">Forma Briseis
mediis in armis movit Achillem</span>, Achilles was moved in the midst of a
battle by fair Briseis, Ajax by Tecmessa; Judith captivated that great
Captain Holofernes: Dalilah, Samson; Rosamund, <a href="#note4897">[4897]</a>Henry the Second;
Roxolana, Suleiman the Magnificent, &amp;c.

intueri</span>; <a href="#note4901">[4901]</a>he was wounded at the first sight, his heart panted, and
he could not possibly turn his eyes from her. So doth Calysiris in
Heliodorus, <span class="cite">lib. 2.</span> Isis Priest, a reverend old man, complain, who by
chance at Memphis seeing that Thracian Rodophe, might not hold his eyes off
her: <a href="#note4902">[4902]</a><q>I will not conceal it, she overcame me with her presence, and
quite assaulted my continency which I had kept unto mine old age; I
resisted a long time my bodily eyes with the eyes of my understanding; at

Xenophiles, a philosopher, railed at women downright for many years
together, scorned, hated, scoffed at them; coming at last into Daphnis a
fair maid's company (as he condoles his mishap to his friend Demaritis),
though free before, <span lang="la">Intactus nullis ante cupidinibus</span>, was far in love,
and quite overcome upon a sudden. <span lang="la">Victus sum fateor a Daphnide</span>, &amp;c. I
confess I am taken,

I could hold out no longer. Such another mishap, but worse, had Stratocles
the physician, that blear-eyed old man, <span lang="la">muco plenus</span> (so <a href="#note4905">[4905]</a>Prodromus
describes him); he was a severe woman's-hater all his life, <span lang="la">foeda et
contumeliosa semper in faeminas profatus</span>, a bitter persecutor of the whole
sex, <span lang="la">humanas aspides et viperas appellabat</span>, he forswore them all still,
and mocked them wheresoever he came, in such vile terms, <span lang="la">ut matrem et
sorores odisses</span>, that if thou hadst heard him, thou wouldst have loathed
thine own mother and sisters for his word's sake. Yet this old doting fool
was taken at last with that celestial and divine look of Myrilla, the
daughter of Anticles the gardener, that smirking wench, that he shaved off
his bushy beard, painted his face, <a href="#note4906">[4906]</a>curled his hair, wore a laurel
crown to cover his bald pate, and for her love besides was ready to run
mad. For the very day that he married he was so furious, <span lang="la">ut solis occasum
minus expectare posset</span> (a terrible, a monstrous long day), he could not
stay till it was night, <span lang="la">sed omnibus insalutatis in thalamum festinans
irrupit</span>, the meat scarce out of his mouth, without any leave taking, he
would needs go presently to bed. What young man, therefore, if old men be
so intemperate, can secure himself? Who can say I will not be taken with a
beautiful object? I can, I will contain. No, saith <a href="#note4907">[4907]</a>Lucian of his
mistress, she is so fair, that if thou dost but see her, she will stupefy
thee, kill thee straight, and, Medusa like, turn thee to a stone; thou
canst not pull thine eyes from her, but, as an adamant doth iron, she will
carry thee bound headlong whither she will herself, infect thee like a
basilisk. It holds both in men and women. Dido was amazed at Aeneas'
presence; <span lang="la">Obstupuit primo aspectu Sidonia Dido</span>; and as he feelingly
verified out of his experience;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4908">[4908]</a>Quam ego postquam vidi, non ita amavi ut sani solent</div>

<p>If you desire to know more particularly what this beauty is, how it doth
<span lang="la">Influere</span>, how it doth fascinate (for, as all hold, love is a
fascination), thus in brief. <a href="#note4910">[4910]</a><q>This comeliness or beauty ariseth from
the due proportion of the whole, or from each several part.</q> For an exact
delineation of which, I refer you to poets, historiographers, and those
amorous writers, to Lucian's Images, and Charidemus, Xenophon's description
of Panthea, Petronius Catalectes, Heliodorus Chariclia, Tacius Leucippe,
Longus Sophista's Daphnis and Chloe, Theodorus Prodromus his Rhodanthes,
Aristaenetus and Philostratus Epistles, Balthazar Castilio, <span class="cite">lib. 4. de
aulico.</span> Laurentius, <span class="cite">cap. 10, de melan.</span> Aeneas Sylvius his Lucretia, and
every poet almost, which have most accurately described a perfect beauty,
an absolute feature, and that through every member, both in men and women.
Each part must concur to the perfection of it; for as Seneca saith, <span class="cite">Ep.
33. lib. 4.</span> <span lang="la">Non est formosa mulier cujus crus laudatur et brachium, sed
illa cujus simul universa facies admirationem singulis partibus dedit</span>;
<q>she is no fair woman, whose arm, thigh, &amp;c. are commended, except the face
and all the other parts be correspondent.</q> And the face especially gives a
lustre to the rest: the face is it that commonly denominates a fair or
foul: <span lang="la">arx formae facies</span>, the face is beauty's tower; and though the other
parts be deformed, yet a good face carries it (<span lang="la">facies non uxor amatur</span>)
that alone is most part respected, principally valued, <span lang="la">deliciis suis
ferox</span>, and of itself able to captivate.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

<q>Glycera's too fair a face was it that set him on fire, too fine to be
beheld.</q> When <a href="#note4912">[4912]</a>Chaerea saw the singing wench's sweet looks, he was so
taken, that he cried out, <span lang="la">O faciem pulchram, deleo omnes dehinc ex animo
mulieres, taedet quotidianarum harum formarum!</span> <q>O fair face, I'll never
love any but her, look on any other hereafter but her; I am weary of these
ordinary beauties, away with them.</q> The more he sees her, the worse he
is,&mdash;<span lang="la">uritque videndo</span>, as in a burning-glass, the sunbeams are

he being a sweaty fuliginous blacksmith, was dearly beloved of her, when
fair Apollo, nimble Mercury were rejected, and the rest of the sweet-faced

useth that epithet of ox-eyed, in describing Juno, because a round black
eye is the best, the son of beauty, and farthest from black the worse:
which <a href="#note4950">[4950]</a>Polydore Virgil taxeth in our nation: <span lang="la">Angli ut plurimum
caesiis oculis</span>, we have grey eyes for the most part. Baptisma Porta,
<span class="cite">Physiognom. lib. 3.</span> puts grey colour upon children, they be childish eyes,
dull and heavy. Many commend on the other side Spanish ladies, and those
<a href="#note4951">[4951]</a>Greek dames at this day, for the blackness of their eyes, as Porta
doth his Neapolitan young wives. Suetonius describes Julius Caesar to have
been <span lang="la">nigris vegetisque oculis micantibus</span>, of a black quick sparkling eye:
and although Averroes in his Colliget will have such persons timorous, yet
without question they are most amorous.

<p>Now last of all, I will show you by what means beauty doth fascinate,
bewitch, as some hold, and work upon the soul of a man by the eye. For
certainly I am of the poet's mind, love doth bewitch and strangely change
us.

Heliodorus <span class="cite">lib. 3.</span> proves at large, <a href="#note4953">[4953]</a>that love is witchcraft, <q>it
gets in at our eyes, pores, nostrils, engenders the same qualities and
affections in us, as were in the party whence it came.</q> The manner of the
fascination, as Ficinus <span class="cite">10. cap. com. in Plat.</span> declares it, is thus:
<q>Mortal men are then especially bewitched, when as by often gazing one on
the other, they direct sight to sight, join eye to eye, and so drink and
suck in love between them; for the beginning of this disease is the eye.
And therefore he that hath a clear eye, though he be otherwise deformed, by
often looking upon him, will make one mad, and tie him fast to him by the
eye.</q> Leonard. Varius, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 2. de fascinat.</span> telleth us, that by
this interview, <a href="#note4954">[4954]</a><q>the purer spirits are infected,</q> the one eye
pierceth through the other with his rays, which he sends forth, and many
men have those excellent piercing eyes, that, which Suetonius relates of
Augustus, their brightness is such, they compel their spectators to look
off, and can no more endure them than the sunbeams. <a href="#note4955">[4955]</a>Barradius,
<span class="cite">lib. 6. cap. 10. de Harmonia Evangel.</span> reports as much of our Saviour
Christ, and <a href="#note4956">[4956]</a>Peter Morales of the Virgin Mary, whom Nicephorus
describes likewise to have been yellow-haired, of a wheat colour, but of a
most amiable and piercing eye. The rays, as some think, sent from the eyes,
carry certain spiritual vapours with them, and so infect the other party,
and that in a moment. I know, they that hold <span lang="la">visio fit intra mittendo</span>,
will make a doubt of this; but Ficinus proves it from blear-eyes, <a href="#note4957">[4957]</a>
<q>That by sight alone, make others blear-eyed; and it is more than manifest,
that the vapour of the corrupt blood doth get in together with the rays,
and so by the contagion the spectators' eyes are infected.</q> Other arguments
there are of a basilisk, that kills afar off by sight, as that Ephesian did
of whom <a href="#note4958">[4958]</a>Philostratus speaks, of so pernicious an eye, he poisoned
all he looked steadily on: and that other argument, <span lang="la">menstruae faminae</span>, out
of Aristotle's Problems, <span lang="la">morbosae</span> Capivaccius adds, and <a href="#note4959">[4959]</a>Septalius
the commentator, that contaminate a looking-glass with beholding it. <a href="#note4960">[4960]</a>
<q>So the beams that come from the agent's heart, by the eyes, infect the
spirits about the patients, inwardly wound, and thence the spirits infect
the blood.</q> To this effect she complained in <a href="#note4961">[4961]</a>Apuleius, <q>Thou art the
cause of my grief, thy eyes piercing through mine eyes to mine inner parts,
have set my bowels on fire, and therefore pity me that am now ready to die
for thy sake.</q> Ficinus illustrates this with a familiar example of that
Marrhusian Phaedrus and Theban Lycias, <a href="#note4962">[4962]</a><q>Lycias he stares on Phaedrus'
face, and Phaedrus fastens the balls of his eyes upon Lycias, and with those
sparkling rays sends out his spirits. The beams of Phaedrus' eyes are easily
mingled with the beams of Lycias, and spirits are joined to spirits. This
vapour begot in Phaedrus' heart, enters into Lycias' bowels; and that which
is a greater wonder, Phaedrus' blood is in Lycias' heart, and thence come
those ordinary love-speeches, my sweetheart Phaedrus, and mine own self, my
dear bowels. And Phaedrus again to Lycias, O my light, my joy, my soul, my
life. Phaedrus follows Lycias, because his heart would have his spirits, and
Lycias follows Phaedrus, because he loves the seat of his spirits; both
follow; but Lycias the earnester of the two: the river hath more need of
the fountain, than the fountain of the river; as iron is drawn to that
which is touched with a loadstone, but draws not it again; so Lycias draws
Phaedrus.</q> But how comes it to pass then, that the blind man loves, that
never saw? We read in the Lives of the Fathers, a story of a child that was
brought up in the wilderness, from his infancy, by an old hermit: now come
to man's estate, he saw by chance two comely women wandering in the woods:
he asked the old man what creatures they were, he told him fairies; after a
while talking <span lang="la">obiter</span>, the hermit demanded of him, which was the
pleasantest sight that ever he saw in his life? He readily replied, the two
<a href="#note4963">[4963]</a>fairies he spied in the wilderness. So that, without doubt, there is
some secret loadstone in a beautiful woman, a magnetic power, a natural
inbred affection, which moves our concupiscence, and as he sings,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Methinks I have a mistress yet to come,</div>
<div class="line">And still I seek, I love, I know not whom.</div>
</div>
'Tis true indeed of natural and chaste love, but not of this heroical
passion, or rather brutish burning lust of which we treat; we speak of
wandering, wanton, adulterous eyes, which, as <a href="#note4964">[4964]</a>he saith, <q>lie still
in wait as so many soldiers, and when they spy an innocent spectator fixed
on them, shoot him through, and presently bewitch him: especially when they
shall gaze and gloat, as wanton lovers do one upon another, and with a
pleasant eye-conflict participate each other's souls.</q> Hence you may
perceive how easily and how quickly we may be taken in love; since at the
twinkling of an eye, Phaedrus' spirits may so perniciously infect Lycias'
blood. <a href="#note4965">[4965]</a><q>Neither is it any wonder, if we but consider how many other
diseases closely, and as suddenly are caught by infection, plague, itch,
scabs, flux,</q> &amp;c. The spirits taken in, will not let him rest that hath
received them, but egg him on. <a href="#note4966">[4966]</a><span lang="la">Idque petit corpus mens unde est
saucia amore</span>; and we may manifestly perceive a strange eduction of
spirits, by such as bleed at nose after they be dead, at the presence of
the murderer; but read more of this in Lemnius, <span class="cite">lib. 2. de occult. nat.

<h4><a name="3.2.2.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Artificial allurements of Love, Causes and Provocations to Lust; Gestures, Clothes, Dower, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Natural beauty is a stronger loadstone of itself, as you have heard, a
great temptation, and pierceth to the very heart; <a href="#note4967">[4967]</a><span lang="la">forma verecundae,
nocuit mihi visa puellae</span>; but much more when those artificial enticements
and provocations of gestures, clothes, jewels, pigments, exornations, shall
be annexed unto it; those other circumstances, opportunity of time and
place shall concur, which of themselves alone were all sufficient, each one
in particular to produce this effect. It is a question much controverted by
some wise men, <span lang="la">forma debeat plus arti an naturae</span>? Whether natural or
artificial objects be more powerful? but not decided: for my part I am of
opinion, that though beauty itself be a great motive, and give an excellent
lustre <span lang="la">in sordibus</span>, in beggary, as a jewel on a dunghill will shine and
cast his rays, it cannot be suppressed, which Heliodorus feigns of
Chariclia, though she were in beggar's weeds: yet as it is used, artificial
is of more force, and much to be preferred.

John Lerius the Burgundian, <span class="cite">cap. 8. hist. navigat. in Brazil.</span> is
altogether on my side. For whereas (saith he) at our coming to Brazil, we
found both men and women naked as they were born, without any covering, so
much as of their privities, and could not be persuaded, by our Frenchmen
that lived a year with them, to wear any, <a href="#note4969">[4969]</a><q>Many will think that our
so long commerce with naked women, must needs be a great provocation to
lust;</q> but he concludes otherwise, that their nakedness did much less
entice them to lasciviousness, than our women's clothes. <q>And I dare boldly
affirm</q> (saith he) <q>that those glittering attires, counterfeit colours,
headgears, curled hairs, plaited coats, cloaks, gowns, costly stomachers,
guarded and loose garments, and all those other accoutrements, wherewith
our countrywomen counterfeit a beauty, and so curiously set out themselves,
cause more inconvenience in this kind, than that barbarian homeliness,
although they be no whit inferior unto them in beauty. I could evince the
truth of this by many other arguments, but I appeal</q> (saith he) <q>to my
companions at that present, which were all of the same mind.</q> His
countryman, Montague, in his essays, is of the same opinion, and so are
many others; out of whose assertions thus much in brief we may conclude,
that beauty is more beholden to art than nature, and stronger provocations
proceed from outward ornaments, than such as nature hath provided. It is
true that those fair sparkling eyes, white neck, coral lips, turgent paps,
rose-coloured cheeks, &amp;c., of themselves are potent enticers; but when a
comely, artificial, well-composed look, pleasing gesture, an affected
carriage shall be added, it must needs be far more forcible than it was,
when those curious needleworks, variety of colours, purest dyes, jewels,
spangles, pendants, lawn, lace, tiffanies, fair and fine linen,
embroideries, calamistrations, ointments, etc. shall be added, they will
make the veriest dowdy otherwise, a goddess, when nature shall be furthered
by art. For it is not the eye of itself that enticeth to lust, but an
<q>adulterous eye,</q> as Peter terms it, <span class="bibcite">2. ii. 14.</span> a wanton, a rolling,
lascivious eye: a wandering eye, which Isaiah taxeth, <span class="bibcite">iii. 16.</span> Christ
himself, and the Virgin Mary, had most beautiful eyes, as amiable eyes as
any persons, saith <a href="#note4970">[4970]</a>Baradius, that ever lived, but withal so modest,
so chaste, that whosoever looked on them was freed from that passion of
burning lust, if we may believe <a href="#note4971">[4971]</a>Gerson and <a href="#note4972">[4972]</a>Bonaventure: there
was no such antidote against it, as the Virgin Mary's face; 'tis not the
eye, but carriage of it, as they use it, that causeth such effects. When
Pallas, Juno, Venus, were to win Paris' favour for the golden apple, as it
is elegantly described in that pleasant interlude of <a href="#note4973">[4973]</a>Apuleius, Juno
came with majesty upon the stage, Minerva gravity, but Venus <span lang="la">dulce
subridens, constitit amaene; et gratissimae, Graticae deam propitiantes</span>, &amp;c.
came in smiling with her gracious graces and exquisite music, as if she had
danced, <span lang="la">et nonnunquam saltare solis oculis</span>, and which was the main matter
of all, she danced with her rolling eyes: they were the brokers and
harbingers of her suite. So she makes her brags in a modern poet,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4974">[4974]</a>Soon could I make my brow to tyrannise,</div>
<div class="line">And force the world do homage to mine eyes.</div>
</div>
The eye is a secret orator, the first bawd, <span lang="la">Amoris porta</span>, and with
private looks, winking, glances and smiles, as so many dialogues they make
up the match many times, and understand one another's meanings, before they
come to speak a word. <a href="#note4975">[4975]</a>Euryalus and Lucretia were so mutually
enamoured by the eye, and prepared to give each other entertainment, before
ever they had conference: he asked her good will with his eyes; she did
<span lang="la">suffragari</span>, and gave consent with a pleasant look. That <a href="#note4976">[4976]</a>Thracian
Rodophe was so excellent at this dumb rhetoric, <q>that if she had but looked
upon any one almost</q> (saith Calisiris) <q>she would have bewitched him, and he
could not possibly escape it.</q> For as <a href="#note4977">[4977]</a>Salvianus observes, <q>the eyes
are the windows of our souls, by which as so many channels, all dishonest
concupiscence gets into our hearts.</q> They reveal our thoughts, and as they
say, <span lang="la">frons animi index</span>, but the eye of the countenance, <a href="#note4978">[4978]</a><span lang="la">Quid
procacibus intuere ocellis</span>? &amp;c. I may say the same of smiling, gait,
nakedness of parts, plausible gestures, &amp;c. To laugh is the proper passion
of a man, an ordinary thing to smile; but those counterfeit, composed,
affected, artificial and reciprocal, those counter-smiles are the dumb
shows and prognostics of greater matters, which they most part use, to
inveigle and deceive; though many fond lovers again are so frequently
mistaken, and led into a fool's paradise. For if they see but a fair maid
laugh, or show a pleasant countenance, use some gracious words or gestures,
they apply it all to themselves, as done in their favour; sure she loves
them, she is willing, coming, &amp;c.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Stultus quando videt quod pulchra puellula ridet,</div>

<q>I love Lalage as much for smiling, as for discoursing,</q> <span lang="la">delectata illa
risit tam blandum</span>, as he said in Petronius of his mistress, being well
pleased, she gave so sweet a smile. It won Ismenias, as he <a href="#note4983">[4983]</a>
confesseth, <span lang="la">Ismene subrisit amatorium</span>, Ismene smiled so lovingly the
second time I saw her, that I could not choose but admire her: and Galla's
sweet smile quite overcame <a href="#note4984">[4984]</a>Faustus the shepherd, <span lang="la">Me aspiciens moils
blande subrisit ocellis</span>. All other gestures of the body will enforce as
much. Daphnis in <a href="#note4985">[4985]</a>Lucian was a poor tattered wench when I knew her
first, said Corbile, <span lang="la">pannosa et Zacera</span>, but now she is a stately piece
indeed, hath her maids to attend her, brave attires, money in her purse,
&amp;c., and will you know how this came to pass? <q>by setting out herself after
the best fashion, by her pleasant carriage, affability, sweet smiling upon
all,</q> &amp;c. Many women dote upon a man for his compliment only, and good
behaviour, they are won in an instant; too credulous to believe that every
light wanton suitor, who sees or makes love to them, is instantly
enamoured, he certainly dotes on, admires them, will surely marry, when as
he means nothing less, 'tis his ordinary carriage in all such companies. So
both delude each other by such outward shows; and amongst the rest, an
upright, a comely grace, courtesies, gentle salutations, cringes, a mincing
gait, a decent and an affected pace, are most powerful enticers, and which
the prophet Isaiah, a courtier himself, and a great observer, objected to
the daughters of Zion, <span class="bibcite">iii. 16.</span> <q>they minced as they went, and made a
tinkling with their feet.</q> To say the truth, what can they not effect by
such means?
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Whilst nature decks them in their best attires</div>

<a href="#note4986">[4986]</a><span lang="la">Urit&mdash;voce, manu, gressu, pectore, fronte, oculis</span>. When art
shall be annexed to beauty, when wiles and guiles shall concur; for to
speak as it is, love is a kind of legerdemain; mere juggling, a
fascination. When they show their fair hand, fine foot and leg withal,
<span lang="la">magnum sui desiderium nobis relinquunt</span>, saith <a href="#note4987">[4987]</a>Balthazar Castilio,
<span class="cite">lib. 1.</span> they set us a longing, <q>and so when they pull up their
petticoats, and outward garments,</q> as usually they do to show their fine
stockings, and those of purest silken dye, gold fringes, laces,
embroiderings, (it shall go hard but when they go to church, or to any
other place, all shall be seen) 'tis but a springe to catch woodcocks; and
as <a href="#note4988">[4988]</a>Chrysostom telleth them downright, <q>though they say nothing with
their mouths, they speak in their gait, they speak with their eyes, they
speak in the carriage of their bodies.</q> And what shall we say otherwise of
that baring of their necks, shoulders, naked breasts, arms and wrists, to
what end are they but only to tempt men to lust!
<div class="poem" lang="la">

There needs no more, as <a href="#note4990">[4990]</a>Fredericus Matenesius well observes, but a
crier to go before them so dressed, to bid us look out, a trumpet to sound,
or for defect a sow-gelder to blow,

</div>
or to what end and purpose? But to leave all these fantastical raptures,
I'll prosecute my intended theme. Nakedness, as I have said, is an odious
thing of itself, <span lang="la">remedium amoris</span>; yet it may be so used, in part, and at
set times, that there can be no such enticement as it is;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4992">[4992]</a>Nec mihi cincta Diana placet, nec nuda Cythere,</div>
<div class="line">Illa voluptatis nil habet, haec nimium.</div>
</div>
<p>David so espied Bathsheba, the elders Susanna: <a href="#note4993">[4993]</a>Apelles was enamoured
with Campaspe, when he was to paint her naked. Tiberius <span class="cite">in Suet. cap. 42.</span>
supped with Sestius Gallus an old lecher, <span lang="la">libidinoso sene, ea lege ut nudae
puellae administrarent</span>; some say as much of Nero, and Pontus Huter of
Carolus Pugnax. Amongst the Babylonians, it was the custom of some
lascivious queans to dance frisking in that fashion, saith Curtius <span class="cite">lib.
5.</span> and Sardus <span class="cite">de mor. gent. lib. 1.</span> writes of others to that effect.
The <a href="#note4994">[4994]</a>Tuscans at some set banquets had naked women to attend upon
them, which Leonicus <span class="cite">de Varia hist. lib. 3. cap. 96.</span> confirms of such
other bawdy nations. Nero would have filthy pictures still hanging in his
chamber, which is too commonly used in our times, and Heliogabalus, <span lang="la">etiam
coram agentes, ut ad venerem incitarent</span>: So things may be abused. A
servant maid in Aristaenetus spied her master and mistress through the
key-hole <a href="#note4995">[4995]</a>merrily disposed; upon the sight she fell in love with her
master. <a href="#note4996">[4996]</a>Antoninus Caracalla observed his mother-in-law with her
breasts amorously laid open, he was so much moved, that he said, <span lang="la">Ah si
liceret</span>, O that I might; which she by chance overhearing, replied as
impudently, <a href="#note4997">[4997]</a><span lang="la">Quicquid libet licet</span>, thou mayst do what thou wilt:
and upon that temptation he married her: this object was not in cause, not
the thing itself, but that unseemly, indecent carriage of it.

<p>When you have all done, <span lang="la">veniunt a veste sagittae</span> the greatest provocations
of lust are from our apparel; God makes, they say, man shapes, and there is
no motive like unto it;
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note4998">[4998]</a>Which doth even beauty beautify,</div>
<div class="line">And most bewitch a wretched eye,</div>
</div>
a filthy knave, a deformed quean, a crooked carcass, a mawkin, a witch, a
rotten post, a hedgestake may be so set out and tricked up, that it shall
make as fair a show, as much enamour as the rest: many a silly fellow is so
taken. <span lang="la">Primum luxuriae, aucupium</span>, one calls it, the first snare of lust;
<a href="#note4999">[4999]</a><span lang="la">Bossus aucupium animarum, lethalem arundinem</span>, a fatal reed, the
greatest bawd, <span lang="la">forte lenocinium, sanguineis lachrymis deplorandum</span>,
saith <a href="#note5000">[5000]</a>Matenesius, and with tears of blood to be deplored. Not that
comeliness of clothes is therefore to be condemned, and those usual
ornaments: there is a decency and decorum in this as well as in other
things, fit to be used, becoming several persons, and befitting their
estates; he is only fantastical that is not in fashion, and like an old
image in arras hangings, when a manner of attire is generally received; but
when they are so new-fangled, so unstaid, so prodigious in their attires,
beyond their means and fortunes, unbefitting their age, place, quality,
condition, what should we otherwise think of them? Why do they adorn
themselves with so many colours of herbs, fictitious flowers, curious
needleworks, quaint devices, sweet-smelling odours, with those inestimable
riches of precious stones, pearls, rubies, diamonds, emeralds, &amp;c.? Why do
they crown themselves with gold and silver, use coronets and tires of
several fashions, deck themselves with pendants, bracelets, earrings,
chains, girdles, rings, pins, spangles, embroideries, shadows, rebatoes,
versicolour ribands? why do they make such glorious shows with their
scarves, feathers, fans, masks, furs, laces, tiffanies, ruffs, falls, calls,
cuffs, damasks, velvets, tinsels, cloth of gold, silver, tissue? with
colours of heavens, stars, planets: the strength of metals, stones, odours,
flowers, birds, beasts, fishes, and whatsoever Africa, Asia, America, sea,
land, art, and industry of man can afford? Why do they use and covet such
novelty of inventions; such new-fangled tires, and spend such inestimable
sums on them? <q>To what end are those crisped, false hairs, painted faces,</q>
as <a href="#note5001">[5001]</a>the satirist observes, <q>such a composed gait, not a step awry?</q>
Why are they like so many Sybarites, or Nero's Poppaea, Ahasuerus'
concubines, so costly, so long a dressing, as Caesar was marshalling his
army, or a hawk in pruning? <a href="#note5002">[5002]</a><span lang="la">Dum moliuntur, dum comuntur annus est</span>:
a <a href="#note5003">[5003]</a>gardener takes not so much delight and pains in his garden, a
horseman to dress his horse, scour his armour, a mariner about his ship, a
merchant his shop and shop-book, as they do about their faces, and all
those other parts: such setting up with corks, straightening with
whalebones; why is it, but as a day-net catcheth larks, to make young men
stoop unto them? Philocharus, a gallant in Aristenaetus, advised his friend
Poliaenus to take heed of such enticements, <a href="#note5004">[5004]</a><q>for it was the sweet
sound and motion of his mistress's spangles and bracelets, the smell of her
ointments, that captivated him first,</q> <span lang="la">Illa fuit mentis prima ruina meae</span>.
<span lang="la">Quid sibi vult pixidum turba</span>, saith <a href="#note5005">[5005]</a>Lucian, <q>to what use are pins,
pots, glasses, ointments, irons, combs, bodkins, setting-sticks? why bestow
they all their patrimonies and husbands' yearly revenues on such
fooleries?</q> <a href="#note5006">[5006]</a><span lang="la">bina patrimonia singulis auribus</span>; <q>why use they
dragons, wasps, snakes, for chains, enamelled jewels on their necks, ears?</q>
<span lang="la">dignum potius foret ferro manus istas religari, atque utinam monilia vere
dracones essent</span>; they had more need some of them be tied in bedlam with
iron chains, have a whip for a fan, and hair-cloths next to their skins,
and instead of wrought smocks, have their cheeks stigmatised with a hot
iron: I say, some of our Jezebels, instead of painting, if they were well
served. But why is all this labour, all this cost, preparation, riding,
running, far-fetched, and dear bought stuff? <a href="#note5007">[5007]</a><q>Because forsooth they
would be fair and fine, and where nature, is defective, supply it by art.</q>
<a href="#note5008">[5008]</a><span lang="la">Sanguine quae vero non rubet, arte rubet</span>, (Ovid); and to that
purpose they anoint and paint their faces, to make Helen of
Hecuba&mdash;<span lang="la">parvamque exortamque puellam&mdash;Europen.</span><a href="#note5009">[5009]</a>To this intent they
crush in their feet and bodies, hurt and crucify themselves, sometimes in
lax-clothes, a hundred yards I think in a gown, a sleeve; and sometimes
again so close, <span lang="la">ut nudos exprimant artus.</span> <a href="#note5010">[5010]</a>Now long tails and
trains, and then short, up, down, high, low, thick, thin, &amp;c.; now little
or no bands, then as big as cart wheels; now loose bodies, then great
farthingales and close girt, &amp;c. Why is all this, but with the whore in the
Proverbs, to intoxicate some or other? <span lang="la">oculorum decipulam</span>,<a href="#note5011">[5011]</a>one
therefore calls it, <span lang="la">et indicem libidinis</span>, the trap of lust, and sure
token, as an ivy-bush is to a tavern.

they do, that instead of a lady he loves a cap and a feather instead of a
maid that should have <span lang="la">verum colorem, corpus solidum et succi plenum</span> (as
Chaerea describes his mistress in the <a href="#note5012">[5012]</a>poet), a painted face, a
ruff-band, fair and fine linen, a coronet, a flower, (<a href="#note5013">[5013]</a><span lang="la">Naturaeque

petticoat, a pure dye instead of a proper woman. For generally, as with
rich-furred conies, their cases are far better than their bodies, and like
the bark of a cinnamon, tree, which is dearer than the whole bulk, their
outward accoutrements are far more precious than their inward endowments.
'Tis too commonly so.

for devotion? or rather, as <a href="#note5017">[5017]</a>Basil tells them, to meet their
sweethearts, and see fashions; for, as he saith, commonly they come so
provided to that place, with such curious compliments, with such gestures
and tires, as if they should go to a dancing-school, a stage-play, or
bawdy-house, fitter than a church.

daughters dishonest; and hear of such dissolute acts, as daily we do, how

how can it be altered? When Venus stood before Anchises (as <a href="#note5018">[5018]</a>Homer

Such a relation we have in <a href="#note5020">[5020]</a>Plutarch, when the queens came and
offered themselves to Antony, <a href="#note5021">[5021]</a><q>with diverse presents, and enticing
ornaments, Asiatic allurements, with such wonderful joy and festivity, they
did so inveigle the Romans, that no man could contain himself, all was
turned to delight and pleasure. The women transformed themselves to Bacchus
shapes, the men-children to Satyrs and Pans; but Antony himself was quite
besotted with Cleopatra's sweet speeches, philters, beauty, pleasing tires:
for when she sailed along the river Cydnus, with such incredible pomp in a
gilded ship, herself dressed like Venus, her maids like the Graces, her
pages like so many Cupids, Antony was amazed, and rapt beyond himself.</q>
Heliodorus, <span class="cite">lib. 1.</span> brings in Dameneta, stepmother to Cnemon, <q>whom she
<a href="#note5022">[5022]</a>saw in his scarves, rings, robes, and coronet, quite mad for the love
of him.</q> It was Judith's pantofles that ravished the eyes of Holofernes.
And <a href="#note5023">[5023]</a>Cardan is not ashamed to confess, that seeing his wife the first
time all in white, he did admire and instantly love her. If these outward
ornaments were not of such force, why doth <a href="#note5024">[5024]</a>Naomi give Ruth counsel
how to please Boaz? and <a href="#note5025">[5025]</a>Judith, seeking to captivate Holofernes,
washed and anointed herself with sweet ointments, dressed her hair, and put
on costly attires. The riot in this kind hath been excessive in times past;
no man almost came abroad, but curled and anointed,

do not walk, but jet and dance,</q> <span lang="la">hic mulier, haec vir</span>, more like players,
butterflies, baboons, apes, antics, than men. So ridiculous, moreover, we
are in our attires, and for cost so excessive, that as Hierome said of old,
<span lang="la">Uno filio villarum insunt pretia, uno lino decies sestertium inseritur</span>;
'tis an ordinary thing to put a thousand oaks and a hundred oxen into a
suit of apparel, to wear a whole manor on his back. What with shoe-ties,
hangers, points, caps and feathers, scarves, bands, curls, &amp;c., in a short
space their whole patrimonies are consumed. Heliogabalus is taxed by
Lampridius, and admired in his age for wearing jewels in his shoes, a
common thing in our times, not for emperors and princes, but almost for
serving men and tailors; all the flowers, stars, constellations, gold and
precious stones do condescend to set out their shoes. To repress the luxury
of those Roman matrons, there was <a href="#note5031">[5031]</a>Lex Valeria and Oppia, and a Cato
to contradict; but no laws will serve to repress the pride and insolency of
our days, the prodigious riot in this kind. Lucullus's wardrobe is put down
by our ordinary citizens; and a cobbler's wife in Venice, a courtesan in
Florence, is no whit inferior to a queen, if our geographers say true: and
why is all this? <q>Why do they glory in their jewels</q> (as <a href="#note5032">[5032]</a>he saith) <q>or
exult and triumph in the beauty of clothes? why is all this cost? to incite
men the sooner to burning lust.</q> They pretend decency and ornament; but let
them take heed, that while they set out their bodies they do not damn their
souls; 'tis <a href="#note5033">[5033]</a>Bernard's counsel: <q>shine in jewels, stink in
conditions; have purple robes, and a torn conscience.</q> Let them take heed
of Isaiah's prophecy, that their slippers and attires be not taken from
them, sweet balls, bracelets, earrings, veils, wimples, crisping-pins,
glasses, fine linen, hoods, lawns, and sweet savours, they become not bald,
burned, and stink upon a sudden. And let maids beware, as <a href="#note5034">[5034]</a>Cyprian
adviseth, <q>that while they wander too loosely abroad, they lose not their
virginities:</q> and like Egyptian temples, seem fair without, but prove
rotten carcases within. How much better were it for them to follow that
good counsel of Tertullian? <a href="#note5035">[5035]</a><q>To have their eyes painted with
chastity, the Word of God inserted into their ears, Christ's yoke tied to
the hair, to subject themselves to their husbands. If they would do so,
they should be comely enough, clothe themselves with the silk of sanctity,
damask of devotion, purple of piety and chastity, and so painted, they
shall have God himself to be a suitor: let whores and queans prank up
themselves, <a href="#note5036">[5036]</a>let them paint their faces with minion and ceruse, they
are but fuels of lust, and signs of a corrupt soul: if ye be good, honest,
virtuous, and religious matrons, let sobriety, modesty and chastity be your
honour, and God himself your love and desire.</q> <span lang="la">Mulier recte olet, ubi
nihil olet</span>, then a woman smells best, when she hath no perfume at all; no
crown, chain, or jewel (Guivarra adds) is such an ornament to a virgin, or
virtuous woman, <span lang="la">quam virgini pudor</span>, as chastity is: more credit in a wise
man's eye and judgment they get by their plainness, and seem fairer than
they that are set out with baubles, as a butcher's meat is with pricks,
puffed up, and adorned like so many jays with variety of colours. It is
reported of Cornelia, that virtuous Roman lady, great Scipio's daughter,
Titus Sempronius' wife, and the mother of the Gracchi, that being by chance
in company with a companion, a strange gentlewoman (some light housewife
belike, that was dressed like a May lady, and, as most of our gentlewomen
are, <q>was <a href="#note5037">[5037]</a>more solicitous of her head-tire than of her health, that
spent her time between a comb and a glass, and had rather be fair than
honest</q> (as Cato said), <q>and have the commonwealth turned topsy-turvy than her
tires marred;</q> and she did nought but brag of her fine robes and jewels,
and provoked the Roman matron to show hers: Cornelia kept her in talk till
her children came from school, and these, said she, are my jewels, and so
deluded and put off a proud, vain, fantastical, housewife. How much better
were it for our matrons to do as she did, to go civilly and decently,
<a href="#note5038">[5038]</a><span lang="la">Honestae mulieris instar quae utitur auro pro eo quod est, ad ea
tantum quibus opus est</span>, to use gold as it is gold, and for that use it
serves, and when they need it, than to consume it in riot, beggar their
husbands, prostitute themselves, inveigle others, and peradventure damn
their own souls? How much more would it be for their honour and credit?
Thus doing, as Hierom said of Blesilla, <a href="#note5039">[5039]</a><q>Furius did not so triumph
over the Gauls, Papyrius of the Samnites, Scipio of Numantia, as she did by
her temperance;</q> <span lang="la">pulla semper veste</span>, &amp;c., they should insult and domineer
over lust, folly, vainglory, all such inordinate, furious and unruly
passions.

<p>But I am over tedious, I confess, and whilst I stand gaping after fine
clothes, there is another great allurement, (in the world's eye at least)
which had like to have stolen out of sight, and that is money, <span lang="la">veniunt a
dote sagittae</span>, money makes the match; <a href="#note5040">[5040]</a><span lang="gr">&Mu;&omicron;&nu;&#x1F78;&nu; &#x1F04;&rho;&gamma;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;
&beta;&lambda;&#x1F73;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&nu;</span>: 'tis like sauce to their meat, <span lang="la">cum carne condimentum</span>, a good
dowry with a wife. Many men if they do hear but of a great portion, a rich
heir, are more mad than if they had all the beauteous ornaments, and those
good parts art and nature can afford, they <a href="#note5041">[5041]</a>care not for honesty,
bringing up, birth, beauty, person, but for money.

If she be rich, then she is fair, fine, absolute and perfect, then they

gentlemen to her suitors; Ethecles, a senator's son, Melissus, a merchant,
&amp;c.; but she forsook them all for one Passius, a base, hirsute, bald-pated
knave; but why was it? <q>His father lately died and left him sole heir of
his goods and lands.</q> This is not amongst your dust-worms alone, poor
snakes that will prostitute their souls for money, but with this bait you
may catch our most potent, puissant, and illustrious princes. That proud
upstart domineering Bishop of Ely, in the time of Richard the First,
viceroy in his absence, as <a href="#note5050">[5050]</a>Nubergensis relates it, to fortify
himself, and maintain his greatness, <span lang="la">propinquarum suarum connubiis,
plurimos sibi potentes et nobiles devincire curavit</span>, married his poor
kinswomen (which came forth of Normandy by droves) to the chiefest nobles
of the land, and they were glad to accept of such matches, fair or foul,
for themselves, their sons, nephews, &amp;c. <span lang="la">Et quis tam praeclaram aflinitatem
sub spe magnae promotionis non optaret</span>? Who would not have done as much for
money and preferment? as mine author <a href="#note5051">[5051]</a>adds. Vortiger, King of
Britain, married Rowena the daughter of Hengist the Saxon prince, his
mortal enemy; but wherefore? she had Kent for her dowry. Iagello the great
Duke of Lithuania, 1386, was mightily enamoured on Hedenga, insomuch that
he turned Christian from a Pagan, and was baptised himself by the name of
Uladislaus, and all his subjects for her sake: but why was it? she was
daughter and heir of Poland, and his desire was to have both kingdoms
incorporated into one. Charles the Great was an earnest suitor to Irene the
Empress, but, saith <a href="#note5052">[5052]</a>Zonarus, <span lang="la">ob regnum</span>, to annex the empire of the
East to that of the West. Yet what is the event of all such matches, that
are so made for money, goods, by deceit, or for burning lust, <span lang="la">quos foeda
libido conjunxit</span>, what follows? they are almost mad at first, but 'tis a
mere flash; as chaff and straw soon fired, burn vehemently for a while, yet
out in a moment; so are all such matches made by those allurements of
burning lust; where there is no respect of honesty, parentage, virtue,
religion, education, and the like, they are extinguished in an instant, and
instead of love comes hate; for joy, repentance and desperation itself.
Franciscus Barbarus in his first book <span class="cite">de re uxoria, c. 5</span>, hath a story of
one Philip of Padua that fell in love with a common whore, and was now
ready to run mad for her; his father having no more sons let him enjoy her;
<a href="#note5053">[5053]</a><q>but after a few days, the young man began to loath, could not so
much as endure the sight of her, and from one madness fell into another.</q>
Such event commonly have all these lovers; and he that so marries, or for
such respects, let them look for no better success than Menelaus had with
Helen, Vulcan with Venus, Theseus with Phaedra, Minos with Pasiphae, and
Claudius with Messalina; shame, sorrow, misery, melancholy, discontent.

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.2.2.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Importunity and Opportunity of Time, Place, Conference, Discourse, Singing, Dancing, Music, Amorous Tales, Objects, Kissing, Familiarity, Tokens, Presents, Bribes, Promises, Protestations, Tears, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>All these allurements hitherto are afar off, and at a distance; I will come
nearer to those other degrees of love, which are conference, kissing,
dalliance, discourse, singing, dancing, amorous tales, objects, presents,
&amp;c., which as so many sirens steal away the hearts of men and women. For,
as Tacitus observes, <span class="cite">l. 2</span>, <a href="#note5054">[5054]</a><q>It is no sufficient trial of a maid's
affection by her eyes alone, but you must say something that shall be more
available, and use such other forcible engines; therefore take her by the
hand, wring her fingers hard, and sigh withal; if she accept this in good
part, and seem not to be much averse, then call her mistress, take her
about the neck and kiss her, &amp;c.</q> But this cannot be done except they first
get opportunity of living, or coming together, ingress, egress, and
regress; letters and commendations may do much, outward gestures and
actions: but when they come to live near one another, in the same street,
village, or together in a house, love is kindled on a sudden. Many a
serving-man by reason of this opportunity and importunity inveigles his
master's daughter, many a gallant loves a dowdy, many a gentleman runs upon
his wife's maids; many ladies dote upon their men, as the queen in Ariosto
did upon the dwarf, many matches are so made in haste, and they are
compelled as it were by <a href="#note5055">[5055]</a>necessity so to love, which had they been
free, come in company of others, seen that variety which many places
afford, or compared them to a third, would never have looked one upon
another. Or had not that opportunity of discourse and familiarity been
offered, they would have loathed and contemned those whom, for want of
better choice and other objects, they are fatally driven on, and by reason
of their hot blood, idle life, full diet, &amp;c., are forced to dote upon them
that come next. And many times those which at the first sight cannot fancy
or affect each other, but are harsh and ready to disagree, offended with
each other's carriage, like Benedict and Beatrice in the <a href="#note5056">[5056]</a>comedy, and
in whom they find many faults, by this living together in a house,
conference, kissing, colling, and such like allurements, begin at last to
dote insensibly one upon another.

<p>It was the greatest motive that Potiphar's wife had to dote upon Joseph,
and <a href="#note5057">[5057]</a>Clitiphon upon Leucippe his uncle's daughter, because the plague
being at Bizance, it was his fortune for a time to sojourn with her, to sit
next her at the table, as he tells the tale himself in Tatius, <span class="cite">lib. 2.</span>
(which, though it be but a fiction, is grounded upon good observation, and
doth well express the passions of lovers), he had opportunity to take her
by the hand, and after a while to kiss, and handle her paps, &amp;c., <a href="#note5058">[5058]</a>
which made him almost mad. Ismenias the orator makes the like confession in
Eustathius, <span class="cite">lib. 1</span>, when he came first to Sosthene's house, and sat at
table with Cratistes his friend, Ismene, Sosthene's daughter, waiting on
them <q>with her breasts open, arms half bare,</q> <a href="#note5059">[5059]</a><span lang="la">Nuda pedem, discincta
sinum, spoliata lacertos</span>; after the Greek fashion in those times,&mdash;<a href="#note5060">[5060]</a>
<span lang="la">nudos media plus parte lacertos</span>, as Daphne was when she fled from
Phoebus (which moved him much), was ever ready to give attendance on him,
to fill him drink, her eyes were never off him, <span lang="la">rogabundi oculi</span>, those
speaking eyes, courting eyes, enchanting eyes; but she was still smiling on
him, and when they were risen, that she had got a little opportunity,
<a href="#note5061">[5061]</a><q>she came and drank to him, and withal trod upon his toes, and would
come and go, and when she could not speak for the company, she would wring
his hand,</q> and blush when she met him: and by this means first she overcame
him (<span lang="la">bibens amorem hauriebam simul</span>), she would kiss the cup and drink to
him, and smile, <q>and drink where he drank on that side of the cup,</q> by
which mutual compressions, kissings, wringing of hands, treading of feet,
&amp;c. <span lang="la">Ipsam mihi videbar sorbillare virginem</span>, I sipped and sipped so long,
till at length I was drunk in love upon a sudden. Philocharinus, in <a href="#note5062">[5062]</a>
Aristaenetus, met a fair maid by chance, a mere stranger to him, he looked
back at her, she looked back at him again, and smiled withal.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5063">[5063]</a>Ille dies lethi primus, primusque malorum</div>
<div class="line">Causa fuit.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
It was the sole cause of his farther acquaintance, and love that undid him.
<a href="#note5064">[5064]</a><span lang="la">O nullis tutum credere blanditiis</span>.

<p>This opportunity of time and place, with their circumstances, are so
forcible motives, that it is impossible almost for two young folks equal in
years to live together, and not be in love, especially in great houses,
princes' courts, where they are idle <span lang="la">in summo gradu</span>, fare well, live at
ease, and cannot tell otherwise how to spend their time. <a href="#note5065">[5065]</a><span lang="la">Illic
Hippolitum pone, Priapus erit</span>. Achilles was sent by his mother Thetis to
the island of Scyros in the Aegean sea (where Lycomedes then reigned) in his
nonage to be brought up; to avoid that hard destiny of the oracle (he
should be slain at the siege of Troy): and for that cause was nurtured in
Genesco, amongst the king's children in a woman's habit; but see the event:
he compressed Deidamia, the king's fair daughter, and had a fine son,
called Pyrrhus by her. Peter Abelard the philosopher, as he tells the tale
himself, being set by Fulbertus her uncle to teach Heloise his lovely
niece, and to that purpose sojourned in his house, and had committed <span lang="la">agnam
tenellam famelico lupo</span>, I use his own words, he soon got her good will,
<span lang="la">plura erant oscula quam sententiae</span> and he read more of love than any other
lecture; such pretty feats can opportunity plea; <span lang="la">primum domo conjuncti,
inde animis</span>, &amp;c. But when as I say, <span lang="la">nox, vinum, et adolescentia</span>, youth,
wine, and night, shall concur, <span lang="la">nox amoris et quietis conscia</span>, 'tis a
wonder they be not all plunged over head and ears in love; for youth is
<span lang="la">benigna in amorem, et prona materies</span>, a very combustible matter, naphtha
itself, the fuel of love's fire, and most apt to kindle it. If there be
seven servants in an ordinary house, you shall have three couple in some
good liking at least, and amongst idle persons how should it be otherwise?
<q>Living at <a href="#note5066">[5066]</a>Rome,</q> saith Aretine's Lucretia, <q>in the flower of my
fortunes, rich, fair, young, and so well brought up, my conversation, age,
beauty, fortune, made all the world admire and love me.</q> Night alone, that
one occasion, is enough to set all on fire, and they are so cunning in
great houses, that they make their best advantage of it: Many a
gentlewoman, that is guilty to herself of her imperfections, paintings,
impostures, will not willingly be seen by day, but as <a href="#note5067">[5067]</a>Castilio
noteth, in the night, <span lang="la">Diem ut glis odit, taedarum lucem super omnia
mavult</span>, she hateth the day like a dormouse, and above all things loves
torches and candlelight, and if she must come abroad in the day, she
covets, as <a href="#note5068">[5068]</a>in a mercer's shop, a very obfuscate and obscure sight.
And good reason she hath for it: <span lang="la">Nocte latent mendae</span>, and many an amorous
gull is fetched over by that means. Gomesius <span class="cite">lib. 3. de sale gen. c.
22.</span> gives instance in a Florentine gentleman, that was so deceived with a
wife, she was so radiantly set out with rings and jewels, lawns, scarves,
laces, gold, spangles, and gaudy devices, that the young man took her to be
a goddess (for he never saw her but by torchlight); but after the wedding
solemnities, when as he viewed her the next morning without her tires, and
in a clear day, she was so deformed, a lean, yellow, shrivelled, &amp;c., such
a beastly creature in his eyes, that he could not endure to look upon her.
Such matches are frequently made in Italy, where they have no other
opportunity to woo but when they go to church, or, as <a href="#note5069">[5069]</a>in Turkey, see
them at a distance, they must interchange few or no words, till such time
they come to be married, and then as Sardus <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 3. de morb.
gent.</span> and <a href="#note5070">[5070]</a>Bohemus relate of those old Lacedaemonians, <q>the bride is
brought into the chamber, with her hair girt about her, the bridegroom
comes in and unties the knot, and must not see her at all by daylight, till
such time as he is made a father by her.</q> In those hotter countries these
are ordinary practices at this day; but in our northern parts, amongst
Germans, Danes, French, and Britons, the continent of Scandia and the rest,
we assume more liberty in such cases; we allow them, as Bohemus saith, to
kiss coming and going, <span lang="la">et modo absit lascivia, in cauponem ducere</span>, to
talk merrily, sport, play, sing, and dance so that it be modestly done, go
to the alehouse and tavern together. And 'tis not amiss, though <a href="#note5071">[5071]</a>
Chrysostom, Cyprian, Hierome, and some other of the fathers speak bitterly
against it: but that is the abuse which is commonly seen at some drunken
matches, dissolute meetings, or great unruly feasts. <a href="#note5072">[5072]</a><q>A young,
pickedevanted, trim-bearded fellow,</q> saith Hierome, <q>will come with a company
of compliments, and hold you up by the arm as you go, and wringing your
fingers, will so be enticed, or entice: one drinks to you, another
embraceth, a third kisseth, and all this while the fiddler plays or sings a
lascivious song; a fourth singles you out to dance, <a href="#note5073">[5073]</a>one speaks by
beck and signs, and that which he dares not say, signifies by passions;
amongst so many and so great provocations of pleasure, lust conquers the
most hard and crabbed minds, and scarce can a man live honest amongst
feastings, and sports, or at such great meetings.</q> For as he goes on,
<a href="#note5074">[5074]</a><q>she walks along and with the ruffling of her clothes, makes men
look at her, her shoes creak, her paps tied up, her waist pulled in to make
her look small, she is straight girded, her hairs hang loose about her
ears, her upper garment sometimes falls, and sometimes tarries to show her
naked shoulders, and as if she would not be seen, she covers that in all
haste, which voluntarily she showed.</q> And not at feasts, plays, pageants,
and such assemblies, <a href="#note5075">[5075]</a>but as Chrysostom objects, these tricks are put
in practice <q>at service time in churches, and at the communion itself.</q> If
such dumb shows, signs, and more obscure significations of love can so
move, what shall they do that have full liberty to sing, dance, kiss, coll,
to use all manner of discourse and dalliance! What shall he do that is
beleaguered of all sides?

How shall he contain? The very tone of some of their voices, a pretty
pleasing speech, an affected tone they use, is able of itself to captivate
a young man; but when a good wit shall concur, art and eloquence,
fascinating speech, pleasant discourse, sweet gestures, the Sirens
themselves cannot so enchant. <a href="#note5077">[5077]</a>P. Jovius commends his Italian
countrywomen, to have an excellent faculty in this kind, above all other
nations, and amongst them the Florentine ladies: some prefer Roman and
Venetian courtesans, they have such pleasing tongues, and such <a href="#note5078">[5078]</a>
elegancy of speech, that they are able to overcome a saint, <span lang="la">Pro facie
multis vox sua lena fuit. Tanta gratia vocis famam conciliabat</span>, saith
Petronius <a href="#note5079">[5079]</a>in his fragment of pure impurities, I mean his <span lang="la">Satyricon,

concordiam</span>; she sang so sweetly that she charmed the air, and thou wouldst
have thought thou hadst heard a concert of Sirens. <q>O good God, when Lais
speaks, how sweet it is!</q> Philocolus exclaims in Aristenaetus, to hear a
fair young gentlewoman play upon the virginals, lute, viol, and sing to it,
which as Gellius observes, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 11.</span> are <span lang="la">lascivientium

A sweet voice and music are powerful enticers. Those Samian singing
wenches, Aristonica, Onanthe and Agathocleia, <span lang="la">regiis diadematibus

chance upon the lute, and sing a pretty song to it in commendations of a

To this effect the lovely virgin with a melodious air upon her golden wired
harp or lute, I know not well whether, played and sang, and that
transported him beyond himself, <q>and that ravished his heart.</q> It was
Jason's discourse as much as his beauty, or any other of his good parts,
which delighted Medea so much.

It was Cleopatra's sweet voice and pleasant speech which inveigled Antony,

<p><a href="#note5088">[5088]</a>Peter Aretine's Lucretia telleth as much and more of herself, <q>I
counterfeited honesty, as if I had been <span lang="la">virgo virginissima</span>, more than a
vestal virgin, I looked like a wife, I was so demure and chaste, I did add
such gestures, tunes, speeches, signs and motions upon all occasions, that
my spectators and auditors were stupefied, enchanted, fastened all to their
places, like so many stocks and stones.</q> Many silly gentlewomen are fetched
over in like sort, by a company of gulls and swaggering companions, that
frequently belie noblemen's favours, rhyming Coribantiasmi, Thrasonean
Rhadomantes or Bombomachides, that have nothing in them but a few player's
ends and compliments, vain braggadocians, impudent intruders, that can
discourse at table of knights and lords' combats, like <a href="#note5089">[5089]</a>Lucian's
Leonitiscus, of other men's travels, brave adventures, and such common
trivial news, ride, dance, sing old ballad tunes, and wear their clothes in
fashion, with a good grace; a fine sweet gentleman, a proper man, who could
not love him! She will have him though all her friends say no, though she
beg with him. Some again are incensed by reading amorous toys, Amadis de
Gaul, Palmerin de Oliva, the Knight of the Sun, &amp;c., or hearing such tales
of <a href="#note5090">[5090]</a>lovers, descriptions of their persons, lascivious discourses,
such as Astyanassa, Helen's waiting-woman, by the report of Suidas, writ of
old, <span lang="la">de variis concubitus modis</span>, and after her Philenis and Elephantine;
or those light tracts of<a href="#note5091">[5091]</a>Aristides Milesius (mentioned by Plutarch)
and found by the Persians in Crassus' army amongst the spoils, Aretine's
dialogues, with ditties, love songs, &amp;c., must needs set them on fire, with
such like pictures, as those of Aretine, or wanton objects of what kind
soever; <q>no stronger engine than to hear or read of love toys, fables and
discourses</q> (<a href="#note5092">[5092]</a>one saith) <q>and many by this means are quite mad.</q> At
Abdera in Thrace (Andromeda one of Euripides' tragedies being played) the
spectators were so much moved with the object, and those pathetical love
speeches of Perseus, amongst the rest, <q>O Cupid, Prince of Gods and men,</q>
&amp;c. that every man almost a good while after spake pure iambics, and raved
still on Perseus' speech, <q>O Cupid, Prince of Gods and men.</q> As carmen,
boys and apprentices, when a new song is published with us, go singing that
new tune still in the streets, they continually acted that tragical part of
Perseus, and in every man's mouth was <q>O Cupid,</q> in every street, <q>O
Cupid,</q> in every house almost, <q>O Cupid, Prince of Gods and men,</q>
pronouncing still like stage-players, <q>O Cupid;</q> they were so possessed all
with that rapture, and thought of that pathetical love speech, they could
not a long time after forget, or drive it out of their minds, but <q>O Cupid,
Prince of Gods and men,</q> was ever in their mouths. This belike made
Aristotle, <span class="cite">Polit. lib. 7. cap. 18.</span> forbid young men to see comedies, or

<q>let not young folks meddle at all with such matters.</q> And this made the
Romans, as <a href="#note5094">[5094]</a>Vitruvius relates, put Venus' temple in the suburbs,
<span lang="la">extra murum, ne adolescentes venereis insuescant</span>, to avoid all occasions
and objects. For what will not such an object do? Ismenias, as he walked in
Sosthene's garden, being now in love, when he saw so many <a href="#note5095">[5095]</a>lascivious
pictures, Thetis' marriage, and I know not what, was almost beside himself.
And to say truth, with a lascivious object who is not moved, to see others
dally, kiss, dance? And much more when he shall come to be an actor
himself.

<p>To kiss and be kissed, which, amongst other lascivious provocations, is as
a burden in a song, and a most forcible battery, as infectious, <a href="#note5096">[5096]</a>
Xenophon thinks, as the poison of a spider; a great allurement, a fire

when she would in kindness overcome a suitor of hers, and have her desire
of him, <q>took him about the neck, and kissed him again and again,</q> and to
that, which she could not otherwise effect, she made him so speedily and
willingly condescend. And 'tis a continual assault,&mdash;<a href="#note5100">[5100]</a><span lang="la">hoc non

such other obscenities that vain lovers use, which are abominable and
pernicious. If, as Peter de Ledesmo <span class="cite">cas. cons.</span> holds, every kiss a man

what have I to do with this?

<p>That which I aim at, is to show you the progress of this burning lust; to
epitomise therefore all this which I have hitherto said, with a familiar
example out of that elegant Musaeus, observe but with me those amorous
proceedings of Leander and Hero: they began first to look one on another
with a lascivious look,

<div class="line">Sic fatus recusantis persuasit mentem puellae.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">With becks and nods he first began</div>
<div class="line">To try the wench's mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line">With becks and nods and smiles again</div>
<div class="line">An answer he did find.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And in the dark he took her by the hand,</div>
<div class="line">And wrung it hard, and sighed grievously,</div>
<div class="line">And kiss'd her too, and woo'd her as he might,</div>
<div class="line">With pity me, sweetheart, or else I die,</div>
<div class="line">And with such words and gestures as there past,</div>
<div class="line">He won his mistress' favour at the last.</div>
</div>
The same proceeding is elegantly described by Apollonius in his
Argonautics, between Jason and Medea, by Eustathius in the ten books of the
loves of Ismenias and Ismene, Achilles Tatius between his Clitophon and
Leucippe, Chaucer's neat poem of Troilus and Cresseide; and in that notable
tale in Petronius of a soldier and a gentlewoman of Ephesus, that was so
famous all over Asia for her chastity, and that mourned for her husband:
the soldier wooed her with such rhetoric as lovers use to do,&mdash;<span lang="la">placitone
etiam pugnabis amori</span>? &amp;c. at last, <span lang="la">frangi pertinaciam passa est</span>, he got
her good will, not only to satisfy his lust, <a href="#note5122">[5122]</a>but to hang her dead
husband's body on the cross (which he watched instead of the thief's that
was newly stolen away), whilst he wooed her in her cabin. These are tales,
you will say, but they have most significant morals, and do well express
those ordinary proceedings of doting lovers.

<p>Many such allurements there are, nods, jests, winks, smiles, wrestlings,
tokens, favours, symbols, letters, valentines, &amp;c. For which cause belike,
Godfridus <span class="cite">lib. 2. de amor</span>. would not have women learn to write. Many such
provocations are used when they come in presence, <a href="#note5123">[5123]</a>10 they will and
will not,

</div>
Hero so tripped away from Leander as one displeased,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5124">[5124]</a>Yet as she went full often look'd behind,</div>
<div class="line">And many poor excuses did she find</div>
<div class="line">To linger by the way,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
but if he chance to overtake her, she is most averse, nice and coy,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Denegat et pugnat, sed vult super omnia vinci.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">She seems not won, but won she is at length,</div>
<div class="line">In such wars women use but half their strength.</div>
</div>
Sometimes they lie open and are most tractable and coming, apt, yielding,
and willing to embrace, to take a green gown, with that shepherdess in
Theocritus, <span class="cite">Edyl. 27.</span> to let their coats, &amp;c., to play and dally, at such
seasons, and to some, as they spy their advantage; and then coy, close
again, so nice, so surly, so demure, you had much better tame a colt, catch
or ride a wild horse, than get her favour, or win her love, not a look, not
a smile, not a kiss for a kingdom. <a href="#note5125">[5125]</a>Aretine's Lucretia was an
excellent artisan in this kind, as she tells her own tale, <q>Though I was by
nature and art most beautiful and fair, yet by these tricks I seemed to be
far more amiable than I was, for that which men earnestly seek and cannot
attain, draws on their affection with a most furious desire. I had a suitor
loved me dearly</q> (said she), <q>and the <a href="#note5126">[5126]</a>more he gave me, the more
eagerly he wooed me, the more I seemed to neglect, to scorn him, and which
I commonly gave others, I would not let him see me, converse with me, no,
not have a kiss.</q> To gull him the more, and fetch him over (for him only I
aimed at) I personated mine own servant to bring in a present from a
Spanish count, whilst he was in my company, as if he had been the count's
servant, which he did excellently well perform: <a href="#note5127">[5127]</a><span lang="la">Comes de monte
Turco</span>, <q>my lord and master hath sent your ladyship a small present, and
part of his hunting, a piece of venison, a pheasant, a few partridges, &amp;c.
(all which she bought with her own money), commends his love and service to
you, desiring you to accept of it in good part, and he means very shortly
to come and see you.</q> Withal she showed him rings, gloves, scarves, coronets
which others had sent her, when there was no such matter, but only to
circumvent him. <a href="#note5128">[5128]</a>By these means (as she concludes) <q>I made the poor
gentleman so mad, that he was ready to spend himself, and venture his
dearest blood for my sake.</q> Philinna, in <a href="#note5129">[5129]</a>Lucian, practised all this
long before, as it shall appear unto you by her discourse; for when
Diphilus her sweetheart came to see her (as his daily custom was) she
frowned upon him, would not vouchsafe him her company, but kissed Lamprius
his co-rival, at the same time <a href="#note5130">[5130]</a>before his face: but why was it? To
make him (as she telleth her mother that chid her for it) more jealous; to
whet his love, to come with a greater appetite, and to know that her favour
was not so easy to be had. Many other tricks she used besides this (as she
there confesseth), for she would fall out with, and anger him of set
purpose, pick quarrels upon no occasion, because she would be reconciled to
him again. <span lang="la">Amantium irae amoris redintegratio</span>, as the old saying is, the
falling out of lovers is the renewing of love; and according to that of
Aristenaetis, <span lang="la">jucundiores amorum post injurias deliciae</span>, love is increased
by injuries, as the sunbeams are more gracious after a cloud. And surely
this aphorism is most true; for as Ampelis informs Crisis in the said
Lucian, <a href="#note5131">[5131]</a><q>If a lover be not jealous, angry, waspish, apt to fall out,
sigh and swear, he is no true lover.</q> To kiss and coll, hang about her
neck, protest, swear and wish, are but ordinary symptoms, <span lang="la">incipientis
adhuc et crescentis amoris signa</span>; but if he be jealous, angry, apt to
mistake, &amp;c., <span lang="la">bene speres licet</span>, sweet sister he is thine own; yet if you
let him alone, humour him, please him, &amp;c., and that he perceive once he
hath you sure, without any co-rival, his love will languish, and he will
not care so much for you. Hitherto (saith she) can I speak out of
experience; Demophantus a rich fellow was a suitor of mine, I seemed to
neglect him, and gave better entertainment to Calliades the painter before
his face, <span lang="la">principio abiit, verbis me insectatus</span>, at first he went away
all in a chafe, cursing and swearing, but at last he came submitting
himself, vowing and protesting he loved me most dearly, I should have all
he had, and that he would kill himself for my sake. Therefore I advise thee
(dear sister Crisis) and all maids, not to use your suitors over kindly;
<span lang="la">insolentes enim sunt hoc cum sentiunt</span>, 'twill make them proud and
insolent; but now and then reject them, estrange thyself, <span lang="la">et si me audies
semel atque iterum exclude</span>, shut him out of doors once or twice, let him
dance attendance; follow my counsel, and by this means <a href="#note5132">[5132]</a>you shall
make him mad, come off roundly, stand to any conditions, and do whatsoever
you will have him. These are the ordinary practices; yet in the said
Lucian, Melissa methinks had a trick beyond all this; for when her suitor
came coldly on, to stir him up, she writ one of his co-rival's names and
her own in a paper, <span lang="la">Melissa amat Hermotimum, Hermotimus Mellissam</span>,
causing it to be stuck upon a post, for all gazers to behold, and lost it
in the way where he used to walk; which when the silly novice perceived,
<span lang="la">statim ut legit credidit</span>, instantly apprehended it was so, came raving to
me, &amp;c. <a href="#note5133">[5133]</a><q>and so when I was in despair of his love, four months after
I recovered him again.</q> Eugenia drew Timocles for her valentine, and wore
his name a long time after in her bosom: Camaena singled out Pamphilus to
dance, at Myson's wedding (some say), for there she saw him first;
Felicianus overtook Caelia by the highway side, offered his service, thence
came further acquaintance, and thence came love. But who can repeat half
their devices? What Aretine experienced, what conceited Lucian, or wanton
Aristenaetus? They will deny and take, stiffly refuse, and yet earnestly
seek the same, repel to make them come with more eagerness, fly from if you
follow, but if averse, as a shadow they will follow you again, <span lang="la">fugientem
sequitur, sequentem fugit</span>; with a regaining retreat, a gentle reluctancy,
a smiling threat, a pretty pleasant peevishness they will put you off, and
have a thousand such several enticements. For as he saith,

(as <a href="#note5136">[5136]</a>Hierome records) to sacrifice to their idols, by no torments or
promises, they took another course to tempt him: they put him into a fair
garden, and set a young courtesan to dally with him, <a href="#note5137">[5137]</a><q>took him about
the neck and kissed him, and that which is not to be named,</q> <span lang="la">manibusque
attrectare</span>, &amp;c., and all those enticements which might be used, that whom
torments could not, love might batter and beleaguer. But such was his
constancy, she could not overcome, and when this last engine would take no
place, they left him to his own ways. At <a href="#note5138">[5138]</a>Berkley in Gloucestershire,
there was in times past a nunnery (saith Gualterus Mapes, an old
historiographer, that lived 400 years since), <q>of which there was a noble
and a fair lady abbess: Godwin, that subtile Earl of Kent, travelling that
way, (seeking not her but hers) leaves a nephew of his, a proper young
gallant (as if he had been sick) with her, till he came back again, and
gives the young man charge so long to counterfeit, till he had deflowered
the abbess, and as many besides of the nuns as he could, and leaves him
withal rings, jewels, girdles, and such toys to give them still, when they
came to visit him. The young man, willing to undergo such a business,
played his part so well, that in short space he got up most of their
bellies, and when he had done, told his lord how he had sped: <a href="#note5139">[5139]</a>his
lord made instantly to the court, tells the king how such a nunnery was
become a bawdy-house, procures a visitation, gets them to be turned out,
and begs the lands to his own use.</q> This story I do therefore repeat, that
you may see of what force these enticements are, if they be opportunely
used, and how hard it is even for the most averse and sanctified souls to
resist such allurements. John Major in the life of John the monk, that
lived in the days of Theodosius, commends the hermit to have been a man of
singular continency, and of a most austere life; but one night by chance
the devil came to his cell in the habit of a young market wench that had
lost her way, and desired for God's sake some lodging with him. <a href="#note5140">[5140]</a><q>The
old man let her in, and after some common conference of her mishap, she
began to inveigle him with lascivious talk and jests, to play with his
beard, to kiss him, and do worse, till at last she overcame him. As he went
to address himself to that business, she vanished on a sudden, and the
devils in the air laughed him to scorn.</q> Whether this be a true story, or a
tale, I will not much contend, it serves to illustrate this which I have
said.

<p>Yet were it so, that these of which I have hitherto spoken, and such like
enticing baits, be not sufficient, there be many others, which will of
themselves intend this passion of burning lust, amongst which, dancing is
none of the least; and it is an engine of such force, I may not omit it.
<span lang="la">Incitamentum libidinis</span>, Petrarch calls it, the spur of lust. <q>A <a href="#note5141">[5141]</a>
circle of which the devil himself is the centre. <a href="#note5142">[5142]</a>Many women that use
it, have come dishonest home, most indifferent, none better.</q> <a href="#note5143">[5143]</a>
Another terms it <q>the companion of all filthy delights and enticements,
and 'tis not easily told what inconveniences come by it, what scurrile talk,
obscene actions,</q> and many times such monstrous gestures, such lascivious
motions, such wanton tunes, meretricious kisses, homely embracings.

that it will make the spectators mad. When that epitomiser of <a href="#note5145">[5145]</a>Trogus
had to the full described and set out King Ptolemy's riot as a chief engine
and instrument of his overthrow, he adds, <span lang="la">tympanum et tripudium</span>, fiddling
and dancing: <q>the king was not a spectator only, but a principal actor
himself.</q> A thing nevertheless frequently used, and part of a gentlewoman's
bringing up, to sing, dance, and play on the lute, or some such instrument,
before she can say her paternoster, or ten commandments. 'Tis the next way
their parents think to get them husbands, they are compelled to learn, and
by that means, <a href="#note5146">[5146]</a><span lang="la">Incoestos amores de tenero meditantur ungue</span>; 'tis a
great allurement as it is often used, and many are undone by it. Thais, in
Lucian, inveigled Lamprias in a dance, Herodias so far pleased Herod, that
she made him swear to give her what she would ask, John Baptist's head in a
platter. <a href="#note5147">[5147]</a>Robert, Duke of Normandy, riding by Falais, spied Arlette,
a fair maid, as she danced on a green, and was so much enamoured with the
object, that <a href="#note5148">[5148]</a>she must needs lie with her that night. Owen Tudor won
Queen Catherine's affection in. a dance, falling by chance with his head in
her lap. Who cannot parallel these stories out of his experience?
Speusippas a noble gallant in <a href="#note5149">[5149]</a>that Greek Aristenaetus, seeing
Panareta a fair young gentlewoman dancing by accident, was so far in love
with her, that for a long time after he could think of nothing but
Panareta: he came raving home full of Panareta: <q>Who would not admire her,
who would not love her, that should but see her dance as I did? O
admirable, O divine Panareta! I have seen old and new Rome, many fair
cities, many proper women, but never any like to Panareta, they are dross,
dowdies all to Panareta! O how she danced, how she tripped, how she turned,
with what a grace! happy is that man that shall enjoy her. O most
incomparable, only, Panareta!</q> When Xenophon, in <span class="cite">Symposio</span>, or Banquet, had
discoursed of love, and used all the engines that might be devised, to move
Socrates, amongst the rest, to stir him the more, he shuts up all with a
pleasant interlude or dance of Dionysius and Ariadne. <a href="#note5150">[5150]</a><q>First Ariadne
dressed like a bride came in and took her place; by and by Dionysius
entered, dancing to the music. The spectators did all admire the young
man's carriage; and Ariadne herself was so much affected with the sight,
that she could scarce sit. After a while Dionysius beholding Ariadne, and
incensed with love, bowing to her knees, embraced her first, and kissed her
with a grace; she embraced him again, and kissed him with like affection,
&amp;c., as the dance required; but they that stood by, and saw this, did much
applaud and commend them both for it. And when Dionysius rose up, he raised
her up with him, and many pretty gestures, embraces, kisses, and love
compliments passed between them: which when they saw fair Bacchus and
beautiful Ariadne so sweetly and so unfeignedly kissing each other, so
really embracing, they swore they loved indeed, and were so inflamed with
the object, that they began to rouse up themselves, as if they would have
flown. At the last when they saw them still, so willingly embracing, and
now ready to go to the bride-chamber, they were so ravished, with it, that
they that were unmarried, swore they would forthwith marry, and those that
were married called instantly for their horses, and galloped home to their
wives.</q> What greater motive can there be than this burning lust? what so
violent an oppugner? Not without good cause therefore so many general
councils condemn it, so many fathers abhor it, so many grave men speak
against it; <q>Use not the company of a woman,</q> saith Siracides, <span class="bibcite">8. 4.</span> <q>that
is a singer, or a dancer; neither hear, lest thou be taken in her
craftiness.</q> <span lang="la">In circo non tam cernitur quam discitur libido</span>. <a href="#note5151">[5151]</a>Haedus
holds, lust in theatres is not seen, but learned. Gregory Nazianzen that
eloquent divine, (<a href="#note5152">[5152]</a>as he relates the story himself,) when a noble
friend of his solemnly invited him with other bishops, to his daughter
Olympia's wedding, refused to come: <a href="#note5153">[5153]</a><q>For it is absurd to see an old
gouty bishop sit amongst dancers;</q> he held it unfit to be a spectator, much
less an actor. <span lang="la">Nemo saltat sobrius</span>, Tully writes, he is not a sober man
that danceth; for some such reason (belike) Domitian forbade the Roman
senators to dance, and for that fact removed many of them from the senate.
But these, you will say, are lascivious and Pagan dances, 'tis the abuse
that causeth such inconvenience, and I do not well therefore to condemn,
speak against, or <q>innocently to accuse the best and pleasantest thing (so
<a href="#note5154">[5154]</a>Lucian calls it) that belongs to mortal men.</q> You misinterpret, I
condemn it not; I hold it notwithstanding an honest disport, a lawful
recreation, if it be opportune, moderately and soberly used: I am of
Plutarch's mind, <a href="#note5155">[5155]</a><q>that which respects pleasure alone, honest
recreation, or bodily exercise, ought not to be rejected and contemned:</q> I
subscribe to <a href="#note5156">[5156]</a>Lucian, <q>'tis an elegant thing, which cheereth up the
mind, exerciseth the body, delights the spectators, which teacheth many
comely gestures, equally affecting the ears, eyes, and soul itself.</q>
Sallust discommends singing and dancing in Sempronia, not that she did sing
or dance, but that she did it in excess, 'tis the abuse of it; and
Gregory's refusal doth not simply condemn it, but in some folks. Many will
not allow men and women to dance together, because it is a provocation to
lust: they may as well, with Lycurgus and Mahomet, cut down all vines,
forbid the drinking of wine, for that it makes some men drunk.

I say of this as of all other honest recreations, they are like fire, good
and bad, and I see no such inconvenience, but that they may so dance, if it
be done at due times, and by fit persons: and conclude with Wolfungus
<a href="#note5158">[5158]</a>Hider, and most of our modern divines: <span lang="la">Si decorae, graves,
verecundae, plena luce bonorum virorum et matronarum honestarum, tempestive

dance,</q> <span class="bibcite">Eccles. iii. 4.</span> Let them take their pleasures then, and as <a href="#note5159">[5159]</a>
he said of old, <q>young men and maids flourishing in their age, fair and
lovely to behold, well attired, and of comely carriage, dancing a Greek
galliard, and as their dance required, kept their time, now turning, now
tracing, now apart now altogether, now a courtesy then a caper,</q> &amp;c., and
it was a pleasant sight to see those pretty knots, and swimming figures.
The sun and moon (some say) dance about the earth, the three upper planets
about the sun as their centre, now stationary, now direct, now retrograde,
now in apogee, then in perigee, now swift then slow, occidental,
oriental, they turn round, jump and trace, &#x2642; and &#x263F; about the
sun with those thirty-three Maculae or Bourbonian planet, <span lang="la">circa Solem
saltantes Cytharedum</span>, saith Fromundus. Four Medicean stars dance about
Jupiter, two Austrian about Saturn, &amp;c., and all (belike) to the music of
the spheres. Our greatest counsellors, and staid senators, at some times
dance, as David before the ark, <span class="bibcite">2 Sam. vi. 14.</span> Miriam, <span class="bibcite">Exod. xv. 20.</span>
Judith, <span class="bibcite">xv. 13.</span> (though the devil hence perhaps hath brought in those bawdy
bacchanals), and well may they do it. The greatest soldiers, as <a href="#note5160">[5160]</a>
Quintilianus, <a href="#note5161">[5161]</a>Aemilius Probus, <a href="#note5162">[5162]</a>Coelius Rhodiginus, have proved
at large, still use it in Greece, Rome, and the most worthy senators,
<span lang="la">cantare, saltare</span>. Lucian, Macrobius, Libanus, Plutarch, Julius, Pollux,
Athenaeus, have written just tracts in commendation of it. In this our age
it is in much request in those countries, as in all civil commonwealths, as
Alexander ab Alexandro, <span class="cite">lib. 4. cap. 10. et lib. 2. cap. 25.</span> hath
proved at large, <a href="#note5163">[5163]</a>amongst the barbarians themselves none so
precious; all the world allows it.

<a href="#note5165">[5165]</a>Plato, in his Commonwealth, will have dancing-schools to be
maintained, <q>that young folks might meet, be acquainted, see one another,

Theodoret <span class="cite">lib. 9. curat. graec. affect</span>. worthily lash him for it; and well
they might: for as one saith, <a href="#note5166">[5166]</a><q>the very sight of naked parts
causeth enormous, exceeding concupiscences, and stirs up both men and women
to burning lust.</q> There is a mean in all things: this is my censure in
brief; dancing is a pleasant recreation of body and mind, if sober and
modest (such as our Christian dances are); if tempestively used, a furious
motive to burning lust; if as by Pagans heretofore, unchastely abused. But
I proceed.

<p>If these allurements do not take place, for <a href="#note5167">[5167]</a>Simierus, that great
master of dalliance, shall not behave himself better, the more effectually
to move others, and satisfy their lust, they will swear and lie, promise,
protest, forge, counterfeit, brag, bribe, flatter and dissemble of all
sides. 'Twas Lucretia's counsel in Aretine, <span lang="la">Si vis amica frui, promitte,
finge, jura, perjura, jacta, simula, mentire</span>; and they put it well in
practice, as Apollo to Daphne,

<q>house, land, goods, are at her service,</q> as he is himself. Dinomachus, a
senator's son in <a href="#note5172">[5172]</a>Lucian, in love with a wench inferior to him in
birth and fortunes, the sooner to accomplish his desire, wept unto her, and
swore he loved her with all his heart, and her alone, and that as soon as
ever his father died (a very rich man and almost decrepit) he would make
her his wife. The maid by chance made her mother acquainted with the
business, who being an old fox, well experienced in such matters, told her
daughter, now ready to yield to his desire, that he meant nothing less, for
dost thou think he will ever care for thee, being a poor wench, <a href="#note5173">[5173]</a>that
may have his choice of all the beauties in the city, one noble by birth,
with so many talents, as young, better qualified, and fairer than thyself?
daughter believe him not: the maid was abashed, and so the matter broke
off. When Jupiter wooed Juno first (Lilius Giraldus relates it out of an
old comment on Theocritus) the better to effect his suit, he turned himself
into a cuckoo, and spying her one day walking alone, separated from the
other goddesses, caused a tempest suddenly to arise, for fear of which she
fled to shelter; Jupiter to avoid the storm likewise flew into her lap, <span lang="la">in
virginis Junonis gremium devolavit</span>, whom Juno for pity covered in her
<a href="#note5174">[5174]</a>apron. But he turned himself forthwith into his own shape, began to
embrace and offer violence unto her, <span lang="la">sed illa matris metu abnuebat</span>, but
she by no means would yield, <span lang="la">donec pollicitus connubium obtinuit</span>, till he
vowed and swore to marry her, and then she gave consent. This fact was done
at Thornax hill, which ever after was called Cuckoo hill, and in perpetual
remembrance there was a temple erected to Telia Juno in the same place. So
powerful are fair promises, vows, oaths and protestations. It is an
ordinary thing too in this case to belie their age, which widows usually
do, that mean to marry again, and bachelors too sometimes,

to say they are younger than they are. Carmides in the said Lucian loved
Philematium, an old maid of forty-five years; <a href="#note5176">[5176]</a>she swore to him she
was but thirty-two next December. But to dissemble in this kind, is
familiar of all sides, and often it takes. <a href="#note5177">[5177]</a><span lang="la">Fallere credentem res
est operosa puellam</span>, 'tis soon done, no such great mastery, <span lang="la">Egregiam vero
laudem, et spolia ampla</span>,&mdash;and nothing so frequent as to belie their
estates, to prefer their suits, and to advance themselves. Many men to
fetch over a young woman, widows, or whom they love, will not stick to
crack, forge and feign any thing comes next, bid his boy fetch his cloak,
rapier, gloves, jewels, &amp;c. in such a chest, scarlet-golden-tissue
breeches, &amp;c. when there is no such matter; or make any scruple to give
out, as he did in Petronius, that he was master of a ship, kept so many
servants, and to personate their part the better take upon them to be
gentlemen of good houses, well descended and allied, hire apparel at
brokers, some scavenger or prick-louse tailors to attend upon them for the
time, swear they have great possessions, <a href="#note5178">[5178]</a>bribe, lie, cog, and foist
how dearly they love, how bravely they will maintain her, like any lady,
countess, duchess, or queen; they shall have gowns, tiers, jewels, coaches,

as old Volpone courted Celia in the <a href="#note5179">[5179]</a>comedy, when as they are no
such men, not worth a groat, but mere sharkers, to make a fortune, to get
their desire, or else pretend love to spend their idle hours, to be more
welcome, and for better entertainment. The conclusion is, they mean nothing
less,

all perjury, that alone for love matters is forgiven by the gods. If

bribes, tokens, gifts, and such like feats. <a href="#note5183">[5183]</a><span lang="la">Plurimus auro

liberal, seek and sue, not to her only, but to all her followers, friends,
familiars, fiddlers, panders, parasites, and household servants; he must
insinuate himself, and surely will, to all, of all sorts, messengers,
porters, carriers; no man must be unrewarded, or unrespected. I had a
suitor (saith <a href="#note5185">[5185]</a>Aretine's Lucretia) that when he came to my house,
flung gold and silver about, as if it had been chaff. Another suitor I had
was a very choleric fellow; but I so handled him, that for all his fuming,
I brought him upon his knees. If there had been an excellent bit in the
market, any novelty, fish, fruit, or fowl, muscatel, or malmsey, or a cup
of neat wine in all the city, it was presented presently to me; though
never so dear, hard to come by, yet I had it: the poor fellow was so fond
at last, that I think if I would I might have had one of his eyes out of
his head. A third suitor was a merchant of Rome, and his manner of wooing
was with <a href="#note5186">[5186]</a>exquisite music, costly banquets, poems, &amp;c. I held him off
till at length he protested, promised, and swore <span lang="la">pro virginitate regno me
donaturum</span>, I should have all he had, house, goods, and lauds, <span lang="la">pro
concubitu solo</span>; <a href="#note5187">[5187]</a>neither was there ever any conjuror, I think, to
charm his spirits that used such attention, or mighty words, as he did
exquisite phrases, or general of any army so many stratagems to win a city,
as he did tricks and devices to get the love of me. Thus men are active and
passive, and women not far behind them in this kind: <span lang="la">Audax ad omnia

Phaedra to Hippolitus. Joessa, in <a href="#note5198">[5198]</a>Lucian, told Pythias, a young man,
to move him the more, that if he would not have her, she was resolved to
make away herself. <q>There is a Nemesis, and it cannot choose but grieve and
trouble thee, to hear that I have either strangled or drowned myself for
thy sake.</q> Nothing so common to this sex as oaths, vows, and protestations,
and as I have already said, tears, which they have at command; for they can
so weep, that one would think their very hearts were dissolved within them,
and would come out in tears; their eyes are like rocks, which still drop
water, <span lang="la">diariae lachrymae et sudoris in modum lurgeri promptae</span>, saith <a href="#note5199">[5199]</a>
Aristaenetus, they wipe away their tears like sweat, weep with one eye,
laugh with the other; or as children <a href="#note5200">[5200]</a>weep and cry, they can both
together.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5201">[5201]</a>Neve puellarum lachrymis moveare memento,</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Care not for women's tears, I counsel thee,</div>
<div class="line">They teach their eyes as much to weep as see.</div>
</div>
And as much pity is to be taken of a woman weeping, as of a goose going
barefoot. When Venus lost her son Cupid, she sent a crier about, to bid
every one that met him take heed.

<h4><a name="3.2.2.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Bawds, Philters, Causes</i>.</h4>

<p>When all other engines fail, that they can proceed no farther of
themselves, their last refuge is to fly to bawds, panders, magical
philters, and receipts; rather than fail, to the devil himself. <span lang="la">Flectere si
nequeunt superos, Acheronta movebunt</span>. And by those indirect means many a
man is overcome, and precipitated into this malady, if he take not good
heed. For these bawds, first, they are everywhere so common, and so many,
that, as he said of old <a href="#note5204">[5204]</a>Croton, <span lang="la">omnes hic aut captantur, aut
captant</span>, either inveigle or be inveigled, we may say of most of our
cities, there be so many professed, cunning bawds in them. Besides, bawdry
is become an art, or a liberal science, as Lucian calls it; and there be
such tricks and subtleties, so many nurses, old women, panders, letter
carriers, beggars, physicians, friars, confessors, employed about it, that
<span lang="la">nullus tradere stilus sufficiat</span>, one saith,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5205">[5205]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;trecentis versibus</div>
<div class="line">Suas impuritias traloqui nemo potest.</div>
</div>
Such occult notes, stenography, polygraphy, <span lang="la">Nuntius animatus</span>, or magnetical
telling of their minds, which <a href="#note5206">[5206]</a>Cabeus the Jesuit, by the way, counts
fabulous and false; cunning conveyances in this kind, that neither Juno's
jealousy, nor Danae's custody, nor Argo's vigilancy can keep them safe.
'Tis the last and common refuge to use an assistant, such as that Catanean
Philippa was to Joan Queen of Naples, a <a href="#note5207">[5207]</a>bawd's help, an old woman in
the business, as <a href="#note5208">[5208]</a>Myrrha did when she doted on Cyniras, and could
not compass her desire, the old jade her nurse was ready at a pinch, <span lang="la">dic
inquit, opemque me sine ferre tibi&mdash;et in hac mea (pone timorem) Sedulitas
erit apta libi</span>, fear it not, if it be possible to be done, I will effect
it: <span lang="la">non est mulieri mulier insuperabilis</span>, <a href="#note5209">[5209]</a>Caelestina said, let him
or her be never so honest, watched and reserved, 'tis hard but one of these
old women will get access: and scarce shall you find, as <a href="#note5210">[5210]</a>Austin
observes, in a nunnery a maid alone, <q>if she cannot have egress, before her
window you shall have an old woman, or some prating gossip, tell her some
tales of this clerk, and that monk, describing or commending some young
gentleman or other unto her.</q> <q>As I was walking in the street</q> (saith a good
fellow in Petronius) <q>to see the town served one evening, <a href="#note5211">[5211]</a>I spied an
old woman in a corner selling of cabbages and roots</q> (as our hucksters do
plums, apples, and such like fruits); <q>mother</q> (quoth he) <q>can you tell where
I can dwell? she, being well pleased with my foolish urbanity, replied, and
why, sir, should I not tell? With that she rose up and went before me. I
took her for a wise woman, and by-and-by she led me into a by-lane, and
told me there I should dwell. I replied again, I knew not the house; but I
perceived, on a sudden, by the naked queans, that I was now come into a
bawdy-house, and then too late I began to curse the treachery of this old
jade.</q> Such tricks you shall have in many places, and amongst the rest it
is ordinary in Venice, and in the island of Zante, for a man to be bawd to
his own wife. No sooner shall you land or come on shore, but, as the
Comical Poet hath it,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5212">[5212]</a>Morem hunc meretrices habent,</div>
<div class="line">Ad portum mittunt servulos, ancillulas,</div>

<div class="line">Post illae extemplo sese adplicent.</div>
</div>
These white devils have their panders, bawds, and factors in every place to
seek about, and bring in customers, to tempt and waylay novices, and silly
travellers. And when they have them once within their clutches, as Aegidius
Mascrius in his comment upon Valerius Flaccus describes them, <a href="#note5213">[5213]</a><q>with
promises and pleasant discourse, with gifts, tokens, and taking their
opportunities, they lay nets which Lucretia cannot avoid, and baits that
Hippolitus himself would swallow; they make such strong assaults and
batteries, that the goddess of virginity cannot withstand them: give gifts
and bribes to move Penelope, and with threats able to terrify Susanna. How
many Proserpinas, with those catchpoles, doth Pluto take? These are the
sleepy rods with which their souls touched descend to hell; this the glue
or lime with which the wings of the mind once taken cannot fly away; the
devil's ministers to allure, entice,</q> &amp;c. Many young men and maids, without
all question, are inveigled by these Eumenides and their associates. But
these are trivial and well known. The most sly, dangerous, and cunning
bawds, are your knavish physicians, empirics, mass-priests, monks, <a href="#note5214">[5214]</a>
Jesuits, and friars. Though it be against Hippocrates' oath, some of them
will give a dram, promise to restore maidenheads, and do it without danger,
make an abortion if need be, keep down their paps, hinder conception,
procure lust, make them able with Satyrions, and now and then step in
themselves. No monastery so close, house so private, or prison so well
kept, but these honest men are admitted to censure and ask questions, to
feel their pulse beat at their bedside, and all under pretence of giving
physic. Now as for monks, confessors, and friars, as he said,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5215">[5215]</a>Non audet Stygius Pluto tentare quod audet</div>
<div class="line">Effrenis monachus, plenaque fraudis anus;</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">That Stygian Pluto dares not tempt or do,</div>
<div class="line">What an old hag or monk will undergo;</div>
</div>
either for himself to satisfy his own lust; for another, if he be hired
thereto, or both at once, having such excellent means. For under colour of
visitation, auricular confession, comfort and penance, they have free
egress and regress, and corrupt, God knows, how many. They can such trades,
some of them, practise physic, use exorcisms, &amp;c.
<div class="blackletter">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5216">[5216]</a>That whereas was wont to walk and Elf,</div>
<div class="line">There now walks the Limiter himself,</div>
<div class="line">In every bush and under every tree,</div>
<div class="line">There needs no other Incubus but he.</div>
</div>
<a href="#note5217">[5217]</a>In the mountains between Dauphine and Savoy, the friars persuaded
the good wives to counterfeit themselves possessed, that their husbands
might give them free access, and were so familiar in those days with some
of them, that, as one<a href="#note5218">[5218]</a>observes, <q>wenches could not sleep in their
beds for necromantic friars:</q> and the good abbess in Boccaccio may in some
sort witness, that rising betimes, mistook and put on the friar's breeches
instead of her veil or hat. You have heard the story, I presume, of <a href="#note5219">[5219]</a>
Paulina, a chaste matron in Aegesippus, whom one of Isis's priests did
prostitute to Mundus, a young knight, and made her believe it was their god
Anubis. Many such pranks are played by our Jesuits, sometimes in their own
habits, sometimes in others, like soldiers, courtiers, citizens, scholars,
gallants, and women themselves. Proteus-like, in all forms and disguises,
that go abroad in the night, to inescate and beguile young women, or to
have their pleasure of other men's wives; and, if we may believe <a href="#note5220">[5220]</a>
some relations, they have wardrobes of several suits in the colleges for
that purpose. Howsoever in public they pretend much zeal, seem to be very
holy men, and bitterly preach against adultery, fornication, there are no
verier bawds or whoremasters in a country; <a href="#note5221">[5221]</a><q>whose soul they should
gain to God, they sacrifice to the devil.</q> But I spare these men for the
present.

<p>The last battering engines are philters, amulets, spells, charms, images,
and such unlawful means: if they cannot prevail of themselves by the help
of bawds, panders, and their adherents, they will fly for succour to the
devil himself. I know there be those that deny the devil can do any such
thing (Crato <span class="cite">epist. 2. lib. med.</span>), and many divines, there is no other
fascination than that which comes by the eyes, of which I have formerly
spoken, and if you desire to be better informed, read Camerarius, <span class="cite">oper
subcis. cent. 2. c. 5.</span> It was given out of old, that a Thessalian wench
had bewitched King Philip to dote upon her, and by philters enforced his
love; but when Olympia, the Queen, saw the maid of an excellent beauty,
well brought up, and qualified&mdash;these, quoth she, were the philters which
inveigled King Philip; those the true charms, as Henry to Rosamond,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5222">[5222]</a>One accent from thy lips the blood more warms,</div>
<div class="line">Than all their philters, exorcisms, and charms.</div>
</div>
With this alone Lucretia brags <a href="#note5223">[5223]</a>in Aretine, she could do more than
all philosophers, astrologers, alchemists, necromancers, witches, and the
rest of the crew. As for herbs and philters, I could never skill of them,
<q>The sole philter that ever I used was kissing and embracing, by which
alone I made men rave like beasts stupefied, and compelled them to worship
me like an idol.</q> In our times it is a common thing, saith Erastus, in his
book <span class="cite">de Lamiis</span>, for witches to take upon them the making of these
philters, <a href="#note5224">[5224]</a><q>to force men and women to love and hate whom they will,
to cause tempests, diseases,</q> &amp;c., by charms, spells, characters,
knots.&mdash;<a href="#note5225">[5225]</a><span lang="la">hic Thessala vendit Philtra</span>. St. Hierome proves that they
can do it (as in Hilarius' life, <span class="cite">epist. lib. 3</span>); he hath a story of a
young man, that with a philter made a maid mad for the love of him, which
maid was after cured by Hilarion. Such instances I find in John Nider,
<span class="cite">Formicar. lib. 5. cap. 5.</span> Plutarch records of Lucullus that he died of a
philter; and that Cleopatra used philters to inveigle Antony, amongst other
allurements. Eusebius reports as much of Lucretia the poet. Panormitan,
<span class="cite">lib. 4. de gest. Aphonsi</span>, hath a story of one Stephan, a Neapolitan
knight, that by a philter was forced to run mad for love. But of all
others, that which <a href="#note5226">[5226]</a>Petrarch, <span class="cite">epist. famil. lib. 1. ep. 5</span>, relates
of Charles the Great (Charlemagne) is most memorable. He foolishly doted
upon a woman of mean favour and condition, many years together, wholly
delighting in her company, to the great grief and indignation of his
friends and followers. When she was dead, he did embrace her corpse, as
Apollo did the bay-tree for his Daphne, and caused her coffin (richly
embalmed and decked with jewels) to be carried about with him, over which
he still lamented. At last a venerable bishop, that followed his court,
prayed earnestly to God (commiserating his lord and master's case) to know
the true cause of this mad passion, and whence it proceeded; it was
revealed to him, in fine, <q>that the cause of the emperor's mad love lay
under the dead woman's tongue.</q> The bishop went hastily to the carcass, and
took a small ring thence; upon the removal the emperor abhorred the corpse,
and, instead <a href="#note5227">[5227]</a>of it, fell as furiously in love with the bishop, he
would not suffer him to be out of his presence; which when the bishop
perceived, he flung the ring into the midst of a great lake, where the king
then was. From that hour the emperor neglected all his other houses, dwelt
at <a href="#note5228">[5228]</a>Ache, built a fair house in the midst of the marsh, to his
infinite expense, and a <a href="#note5229">[5229]</a>temple by it, where after he was buried, and
in which city all his posterity ever since use to be crowned. Marcus the
heretic is accused by Irenaeus, to have inveigled a young maid by this
means; and some writers speak hardly of the Lady Katharine Cobham, that by
the same art she circumvented Humphrey Duke of Gloucester to be her
husband. Sycinius Aemilianus summoned <a href="#note5230">[5230]</a>Apuleius to come before
Cneius Maximus, proconsul of Africa, that he being a poor fellow, <q>had
bewitched by philters Pudentilla, an ancient rich matron, to love him,</q>
and, being worth so many thousand sesterces, to be his wife. Agrippa,
<span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 48. occult. philos.</span> attributes much in this kind to
philters, amulets, images: and Salmutz <span class="cite">com. in Pancirol. Tit. 10. de
Horol.</span> Leo Afer, <span class="cite">lib. 3</span>, saith, 'tis an ordinary practice at Fez in
Africa, <span lang="la">Praestigiatores ibi plures, qui cogunt amores et concubitus</span>: as
skilful all out as that hyperborean magician, of whom Cleodemus, in <a href="#note5231">[5231]</a>
Lucian, tells so many fine feats performed in this kind. But Erastus,
Wierus, and others are against it; they grant indeed such things may be
done, but (as Wierus discourseth, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de Lamiis. cap. 37.</span>) not by
charms, incantations, philters, but the devil himself; <span class="cite">lib. 5. cap. 2.</span>
he contends as much; so doth Freitagius, <span class="cite">noc. med. cap. 74.</span> Andreas
Cisalpinus, <span class="cite">cap. 5</span>; and so much Sigismundus Scheretzius, <span class="cite">cap. 9. de
hirco nocturno</span>, proves at large. <a href="#note5232">[5232]</a><q>Unchaste women by the help of
these witches, the devil's kitchen maids, have their loves brought to them
in the night, and carried back again by a phantasm flying in the air in the
likeness of a goat. I have heard</q> (saith he) <q>divers confess, that they have
been so carried on a goat's back to their sweethearts, many miles in a
night.</q> Others are of opinion that these feats, which most suppose to be
done by charms and philters, are merely effected by natural causes, as by
man's blood chemically prepared, which much avails, saith Ernestus
Burgravius, <span lang="la">in Lucerna vitae et mortis Indice, ad amorem conciliandum et
odium</span>, (so huntsmen make their dogs love them, and farmers their pullen,)
'tis an excellent philter, as he holds, <span lang="la">sed vulgo prodere grande nefas</span>,
but not fit to be made common: and so be <span lang="la">Mala insana</span>, mandrake roots,

Vitruvius, Ovid, Strabo, that made all such mad for love that drank of it,
or that hot bath at <a href="#note5236">[5236]</a>Aix in Germany, wherein Cupid once dipped his
arrows, which ever since hath a peculiar virtue to make them lovers all
that wash in it. But hear the poet's own description of it,

sickness therefore often happeneth to young women, a cachexia or an evil

<p>Accius Sanazarius <span class="cite">Egloga 2. de Galatea</span>, in the same manner feigns his
Lychoris <a href="#note5249">[5249]</a>tormenting herself for want of sleep, sighing, sobbing, and
lamenting; and Eustathius in his Ismenias much troubled, and <a href="#note5250">[5250]</a>
<q>panting at heart, at the sight of his mistress,</q> he could not sleep, his
bed was thorns. <a href="#note5251">[5251]</a>All make leanness, want of appetite, want of sleep
ordinary symptoms, and by that means they are brought often so low, so much
altered and changed, that as <a href="#note5252">[5252]</a>he jested in the comedy, <q>one scarce
know them to be the same men.</q>

Many such symptoms there are of the body to discern lovers by,&mdash;<span lang="la">quis enim
bene celet amorem</span>? Can a man, saith Solomon, <span class="bibcite">Prov. vi. 27</span>, carry fire in
his bosom and not burn? it will hardly be hid; though they do all they can
to hide it, it must out, <span lang="la">plus quam mille notis</span>&mdash;it may be described,
<a href="#note5253">[5253]</a><span lang="la">quoque magis tegitur, tectus magis aestuat ignis</span>. 'Twas Antiphanes
the comedian's observation of old, Love and drunkenness cannot be
concealed, <span lang="la">Celare alia possis, haec praeter duo, vini potum</span>, &amp;c. words,
looks, gestures, all will betray them; but two of the most notable signs
are observed by the pulse and countenance. When Antiochus, the son of
Seleucus, was sick for Stratonice, his mother-in-law, and would not confess
his grief, or the cause of his disease, Erasistratus, the physician, found
him by his pulse and countenance to be in love with her, <a href="#note5254">[5254]</a><q>because
that when she came in presence, or was named, his pulse varied, and he
blushed besides.</q> In this very sort was the love of Callices, the son of
Polycles, discovered by Panacaeas the physician, as you may read the story
at large in <a href="#note5255">[5255]</a>Aristenaetus. By the same signs Galen brags that he found
out Justa, Boethius the consul's wife, to dote on Pylades the player,
because at his name still she both altered pulse and countenance, as <a href="#note5256">[5256]</a>
Polyarchus did at the name of Argenis. Franciscus Valesius, <span class="cite">l. 3. controv.
13. med. contr.</span> denies there is any such <span lang="la">pulsus amatorius</span>, or that love
may be so discerned; but Avicenna confirms this of Galen out of his
experience, <span class="cite">lib. 3. Fen. 1.</span> and Gordonius, <span class="cite">cap. 20.</span> <a href="#note5257">[5257]</a><q>Their
pulse, he saith, is ordinate and swift, if she go by whom he loves,</q>
Langius, <span class="cite">epist. 24. lib. 1. med. epist.</span> Neviscanus, <span class="cite">lib. 4. numer. 66.
syl. nuptialis</span>, Valescus de Taranta, Guianerius, <span class="cite">Tract. 15.</span> Valleriola
sets down this for a symptom, <a href="#note5258">[5258]</a><q>Difference of pulse, neglect of
business, want of sleep, often sighs, blushings, when there is any speech
of their mistress, are manifest signs.</q> But amongst the rest, Josephus
Struthis, that Polonian, in the fifth book, <span class="cite">cap. 17.</span> of his Doctrine of
Pulses, holds that this and all other passions of the mind may be
discovered by the pulse. <a href="#note5259">[5259]</a><q>And if you will know, saith he, whether
the men suspected be such or such, touch their arteries,</q> &amp;c. And in his
fourth book, fourteenth chapter, he speaks of this particular pulse, <a href="#note5260">[5260]</a>
<q>Love makes an unequal pulse,</q> &amp;c., he gives instance of a gentlewoman,
<a href="#note5261">[5261]</a>a patient of his, whom by this means he found to be much enamoured,
and with whom: he named many persons, but at the last when his name came
whom he suspected, <a href="#note5262">[5262]</a><q>her pulse began to vary and to beat swifter, and
so by often feeling her pulse, he perceived what the matter was.</q>
Apollonius <span class="cite">Argonaut. lib. 4.</span> poetically setting down the meeting of Jason
and Medea, makes them both to blush at one another's sight, and at the
first they were not able to speak.

their mouth, leaps, these burn and freeze, (for love is fire, ice, hot,
cold, itch, fever, frenzy, pleurisy, what not) they look pale, red, and
commonly blush at their first congress; and sometimes through violent
agitation of spirits bleed at nose, or when she is talked of; which very
sign <a href="#note5265">[5265]</a>Eustathius makes an argument of Ismene's affection, that when
she met her sweetheart by chance, she changed her countenance to a
maiden-blush. 'Tis a common thing amongst lovers, as <a href="#note5266">[5266]</a>Arnulphus, that
merry-conceited bishop, hath well expressed in a facetious epigram of his,
<div class="poem" lang="la">

</div>
But the best conjectures are taken from such symptoms as appear when they
are both present; all their speeches, amorous glances, actions, lascivious
gestures will betray them; they cannot contain themselves, but that they
will be still kissing. <a href="#note5267">[5267]</a>Stratocles, the physician, upon his
wedding-day, when he was at dinner, <span lang="la">Nihil prius sorbillavit, quam tria
basia puellae pangeret</span>, could not eat his meat for kissing the bride, &amp;c.
First a word, and then a kiss, then some other compliment, and then a kiss,
then an idle question, then a kiss, and when he had pumped his wits dry,
can say no more, kissing and colling are never out of season, <a href="#note5268">[5268]</a><span lang="la">Hoc

They cannot, I say, contain themselves, they will be still not only joining
hands, kissing, but embracing, treading on their toes, &amp;c., diving into
their bosoms, and that <span lang="la">libenter, et cum delectatione</span>, as <a href="#note5276">[5276]</a>
Philostratus confesseth to his mistress; and Lamprias in Lucian, <span lang="la">Mammillas
premens, per sinum clam dextra</span>, &amp;c., feeling their paps, and that scarce
honestly sometimes: as the old man in the <a href="#note5277">[5277]</a>Comedy well observed of
his son, <span lang="la">Non ego te videbam manum huic puellae in sinum insere</span>? Did not I
see thee put thy hand into her bosom? go to, with many such love tricks.
<a href="#note5278">[5278]</a>Juno in Lucian <span class="cite">deorum, tom. 3. dial. 3.</span> complains to Jupiter of
Ixion, <a href="#note5279">[5279]</a><q>he looked so attentively on her, and sometimes would sigh
and weep in her company, and when I drank by chance, and gave Ganymede the
cup, he would desire to drink still in the very cup that I drank of, and in
the same place where I drank, and would kiss the cup, and then look
steadily on me, and sometimes sigh, and then again smile.</q> If it be so they
cannot come near to dally, have not that opportunity, familiarity, or
acquaintance to confer and talk together; yet if they be in presence, their
eye will betray them: <span lang="la">Ubi amor ibi oculus</span>, as the common saying is,
<q>where I look I like, and where I like I love;</q> but they will lose
themselves in her looks.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Alter in alterius jactantes lumina vultus,</div>
<div class="line">Quaerebant taciti noster ubi esset amor.</div>
</div>
<q>They cannot look off whom they love,</q> they will <span lang="la">impregnare eam, ipsis
oculis</span>, deflower her with their eyes, be still gazing, staring, stealing
faces, smiling, glancing at her, as <a href="#note5280">[5280]</a>Apollo on Leucothoe, the moon on
her <a href="#note5281">[5281]</a>Endymion, when she stood still in Caria, and at Latmos caused
her chariot to be stayed. They must all stand and admire, or if she go by,
look after her as long as they can see her, she is <span lang="la">animae auriga</span>, as
Anacreon calls her, they cannot go by her door or window, but, as an
adamant, she draws their eyes to it; though she be not there present, they
must needs glance that way, and look back to it. Aristenaetus of <a href="#note5282">[5282]</a>
Exithemus, Lucian, in his Imagim. of himself, and Tatius of Clitophon, say
as much, <span lang="la">Ille oculos de Leucippe <a href="#note5283">[5283]</a>nunquam dejiciebat</span>, and many
lovers confess when they came in their mistress' presence, they could not
hold off their eyes, but looked wistfully and steadily on her, <span lang="la">inconnivo
aspectu</span>, with much eagerness and greediness, as if they would look through,
or should never have enough sight of her. <span lang="la">Fixis ardens obtutibus haeret</span>; so
she will do by him, drink to him with her eyes, nay, drink him up, devour
him, swallow him, as Martial's Mamurra is remembered to have done:
<span lang="la">Inspexit molles pueros, oculisque comedit</span>, &amp;c. There is a pleasant story
to this purpose in <span class="cite">Navigat. Vertom. lib. 3. cap. 5.</span> The sultan of Sana's
wife in Arabia, because Vertomannus was fair and white, could not look off
him, from sunrising to sunsetting; she could not desist; she made him one
day come into her chamber, <span lang="la">et geminae, horae spatio intuebatur, non a me
anquam aciem oculorum avertebat, me observans veluti Cupidinem quendam</span>,
for two hours' space she still gazed on him. A young man in <a href="#note5284">[5284]</a>Lucian
fell in love with Venus' picture; he came every morning to her temple, and
there continued all day long <a href="#note5285">[5285]</a>from sunrising to sunset, unwilling to
go home at night, sitting over against the goddess's picture, he did
continually look upon her, and mutter to himself I know not what. If so be
they cannot see them whom they love, they will still be walking and waiting
about their mistress's doors, taking all opportunity to see them, as in
<a href="#note5286">[5286]</a>Longus Sophista, Daphnis and Chloe, two lovers, were still hovering
at one another's gates, he sought all occasions to be in her company, to
hunt in summer, and catch birds in the frost about her father's house in
the winter, that she might see him, and he her. <a href="#note5287">[5287]</a><q>A king's palace was
not so diligently attended,</q> saith Aretine's Lucretia, <q>as my house was
when I lay in Rome; the porch and street was ever full of some, walking or
riding, on set purpose to see me; their eye was still upon my window; as
they passed by, they could not choose but look back to my house when they
were past, and sometimes hem or cough, or take some impertinent occasion to
speak aloud, that I might look out and observe them.</q> 'Tis so in other
places, 'tis common to every lover, 'tis all his felicity to be with her,
to talk with her; he is never well but in her company, and will walk <a href="#note5288">[5288]</a>
<q>seven or eight times a day through the street where she dwells, and make
sleeveless errands to see her;</q> plotting still where, when, and how to
visit her,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5289">[5289]</a>Levesque sub nocte susurri,</div>
<div class="line">Composita repetuntur hora.</div>
</div>
And when he is gone, he thinks every minute an hour, every hour as long as
a day, ten days a whole year, till he see her again. <a href="#note5290">[5290]</a><span lang="la">Tempora si
numeres, bene quae numeramus amantes.</span> And if thou be in love, thou wilt say
so too, <span lang="la">Et longum formosa, vale</span>, farewell sweetheart, <span lang="la">vale charissima
Argenis</span>, &amp;c. Farewell my dear Argenis, once more farewell, farewell. And
though he is to meet her by compact, and that very shortly, perchance
tomorrow, yet both to depart, he'll take his leave again, and again, and
then come back again, look after, and shake his hand, wave his hat afar
off. Now gone, he thinks it long till he see her again, and she him, the
clocks are surely set back, the hour's past,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5291">[5291]</a>Hospita Demophoon tua te Rodopheia Phillis,</div>
<div class="line">Ultra promissum tempus abesse queror.</div>
</div>
She looks out at window still to see whether he come, <a href="#note5292">[5292]</a>and by report
Phillis went nine times to the seaside that day, to see if her Demophoon
were approaching, and <a href="#note5293">[5293]</a>Troilus to the city gates, to look for his
Cresseid. She is ill at ease, and sick till she see him again, peevish in
the meantime; discontent, heavy, sad, and why comes he not? where is he?
why breaks he promise? why tarries he so long? sure he is not well; sure he
hath some mischance; sure he forgets himself and me; with infinite such.
And then, confident again, up she gets, out she looks, listens, and
inquires, hearkens, kens; every man afar off is sure he, every stirring in
the street, now he is there, that's he, <span lang="la">male aurorae, malae soli dicit,
deiratque</span>, &amp;c., the longest day that ever was, so she raves, restless and
impatient; for <span lang="la">Amor non patitur moras</span>, love brooks no delays: the time's
quickly gone that's spent in her company, the miles short, the way
pleasant; all weather is good whilst he goes to her house, heat or cold;
though his teeth chatter in his head, he moves not; wet or dry, 'tis all
one; wet to the skin, he feels it not, cares not at least for it, but will
easily endure it and much more, because it is done with alacrity, and for
his mistress's sweet sake; let the burden be never so heavy, love makes it
light. <a href="#note5294">[5294]</a>Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and it was quickly gone
because he loved her. None so merry; if he may happily enjoy her company,
he is in heaven for a time; and if he may not, dejected in an instant,
solitary, silent, he departs weeping, lamenting, sighing, complaining.

<p>But the symptoms of the mind in lovers are almost infinite, and so diverse,
that no art can comprehend them; though they be merry sometimes, and rapt
beyond themselves for joy: yet most part, love is a plague, a torture, a
hell, a bitter sweet passion at last; <a href="#note5295">[5295]</a><span lang="la">Amor melle et felle est
faecundissimus, gustum dat dulcem et amarum</span>. 'Tis <span lang="la">suavis amaricies,
dolentia delectabilis, hilare tormentum</span>;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5296">[5296]</a>Et me melle beant suaviora,</div>
<div class="line">Et me felle necant amariora.</div>
</div>
like a summer fly or sphinx's wings, or a rainbow of all colours,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Quae ad solis radios conversae aureae erant,</div>
<div class="line">Adversus nubes ceruleae, quale jabar iridis,</div>
</div>
fair, foul, and full of variation, though most part irksome and bad. For in
a word, the Spanish Inquisition is not comparable to it; <q>a torment</q> and
<a href="#note5297">[5297]</a><q>execution</q> as it is, as he calls it in the poet, an unquenchable
fire, and what not? <a href="#note5298">[5298]</a>From it, saith Austin, arise <q>biting cares,
perturbations, passions, sorrows, fears, suspicions, discontents,
contentions, discords, wars, treacheries, enmities, flattery, cozening,
riot, impudence, cruelty, knavery,</q> &amp;c.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5299">[5299]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;dolor, querelae,</div>
<div class="line">Lamentatio, lachrymae perennes,</div>
<div class="line">Languor, anxietas, amaritudo;</div>
<div class="line">Aut si triste magis potest quid esse,</div>
<div class="line">Hos tu das comites Neaera vitae.</div>
</div>
These be the companions of lovers, and the ordinary symptoms, as the poet
repeats them.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5300">[5300]</a>In amore haec insunt vitia,</div>
<div class="line">Suspiciones, inimicitiae, audaciae,</div>
<div class="line">Bellum, pax rursum, &amp;c.</div>

<div class="line">Excogitantia excors immodestia,</div>
<div class="line">Petulantia, cupiditas, et malevolentia;</div>
<div class="line">Inhaeret etiam aviditas, desidia, injuria,</div>
<div class="line">Inopia, contumelia et dispendium, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">In love these vices are; suspicions.</div>
<div class="line">Peace, war, and impudence, detractions.</div>
<div class="line">Dreams, cares, and errors, terrors and affrights,</div>
<div class="line">Immodest pranks, devices, sleights and flights,</div>
<div class="line">Heart-burnings, wants, neglects, desire of wrong,</div>
<div class="line">Loss continual, expense and hurt among.</div>
</div>
<p>Every poet is full of such catalogues of love symptoms; but fear and sorrow
may justly challenge the chief place. Though Hercules de Saxonia, <span class="cite">cap. 3.
Tract. de melanch.</span> will exclude fear from love melancholy, yet I am
otherwise persuaded. <a href="#note5302">[5302]</a><span lang="la">Res est solliciti plena timoris amor.</span> 'Tis
full of fear, anxiety, doubt, care, peevishness, suspicion; it turns a man
into a woman, which made Hesiod belike put Fear and Paleness Venus'
daughters,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Marti clypeos atque arma secanti</div>
<div class="line">Alma Venus peperit Pallorem, unaque Timorem:</div>
</div>
because fear and love are still linked together. Moreover they are apt to
mistake, amplify, too credulous sometimes, too full of hope and confidence,
and then again very jealous, unapt to believe or entertain any good news.
The comical poet hath prettily painted out this passage amongst the rest in
a <a href="#note5303">[5303]</a>dialogue betwixt Mitio and Aeschines, a gentle father and a
lovesick son. <q>Be of good cheer, my son, thou shalt have her to wife. Ae.
Ah father, do you mock me now? M. I mock thee, why? Ae. That which I so
earnestly desire, I more suspect and fear. M. Get you home, and send for
her to be your wife. Ae. What now a wife, now father,</q> &amp;c. These doubts,
anxieties, suspicions, are the least part of their torments; they break
many times from passions to actions, speak fair, and flatter, now most
obsequious and willing, by and by they are averse, wrangle, fight, swear,
quarrel, laugh, weep: and he that doth not so by fits, <a href="#note5304">[5304]</a>Lucian holds,
is not thoroughly touched with this loadstone of love. So their actions and
passions are intermixed, but of all other passions, sorrow hath the
greatest share; <a href="#note5305">[5305]</a>love to many is bitterness itself; <span lang="la">rem amaram</span>
Plato calls it, a bitter potion, an agony, a plague.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Eripite hanc pestem perniciemque mihi;</div>

<div class="line">O take away this plague, this mischief from me,</div>
<div class="line">Which, as a numbness over all my body,</div>

The moon in <a href="#note5308">[5308]</a>Lucian made her moan to Venus, that she was almost dead
for love, <span lang="la">pereo equidem amore</span>, and after a long tale, she broke off
abruptly and wept, <a href="#note5309">[5309]</a><q>O Venus, thou knowest my poor heart.</q> Charmides,
in <a href="#note5310">[5310]</a>Lucian, was so impatient, that he sobbed and sighed, and tore his

part of a lover's life is full of agony, anxiety, fear, and grief,
complaints, sighs, suspicions, and cares, (heigh-ho, my heart is woe) full
of silence and irksome solitariness?

so strong an imagination, that at length he thinks he sees her indeed; he
talks with her, he embraceth her, Ixion-like, <span lang="la">pro Junone nubem</span>, a cloud

Abraham Hoffemannus, <span class="cite">lib. 1. amor conjugal, cap. 2. p. 22.</span> relates out of
Plato, how that Empedocles, the philosopher, was present at the cutting up
of one that died for love, <a href="#note5359">[5359]</a><q>his heart was combust, his liver smoky,
his lungs dried up, insomuch that he verily believed his soul was either
sodden or roasted through the vehemency of love's fire.</q> Which belike made
a modern writer of amorous emblems express love's fury by a pot hanging
over the fire, and Cupid blowing the coals. As the heat consumes the water,
<a href="#note5360">[5360]</a><span lang="la">Sic sua consumit viscera coecus amor</span>, so doth love dry up his
radical moisture. Another compares love to a melting torch, which stood too
near the fire.

So that to say truth, as <a href="#note5362">[5362]</a>Castilio describes it, <q>The beginning,
middle, end of love is nought else but sorrow, vexation, agony, torment,
irksomeness, wearisomeness; so that to be squalid, ugly, miserable,
solitary, discontent, dejected, to wish for death, to complain, rave, and
to be peevish, are the certain signs and ordinary actions of a lovesick
person.</q> This continual pain and torture makes them forget themselves, if
they be far gone with it, in doubt, despair of obtaining, or eagerly bent,
to neglect all ordinary business.

or small mystery in nature unsearched, since he was enamoured can do
nothing now but think and meditate of love matters, day and night composeth
himself how to please his mistress; all his study, endeavour, is to approve
himself to his mistress, to win his mistress' favour, to compass his
desire, to be counted her servant.</q> When Peter Abelard, that great scholar

<p>Now to this end and purpose, if there be any hope of obtaining his suit, to
prosecute his cause, he will spend himself, goods, fortunes for her, and
though he lose and alienate all his friends, be threatened, be cast off,

though he be utterly undone by it, disgraced, go a begging, yet for her
sweet sake, to enjoy her, he will willingly beg, hazard all he hath, goods,

Parthenis in Aristaenetus <a href="#note5376">[5376]</a>was fully resolved to do as much. <q>I may
have better matches, I confess, but farewell shame, farewell honour,
farewell honesty, farewell friends and fortunes, &amp;c. O, Harpedona, keep my
counsel, I will leave all for his sweet sake, I will have him, say no more,
<span lang="la">contra gentes</span>, I am resolved, I will have him.</q> Gobrias<a href="#note5377">[5377]</a>, the
captain, when, he had espied Rhodanthe, the fair captive maid, fell upon
his knees before Mystilus, the general, with tears, vows, and all the
rhetoric he could, by the scars he had formerly received, the good service
he had done, or whatsoever else was dear unto him, besought his governor he
might have the captive virgin to be his wife, <span lang="la">virtutis suae spolium</span>, as a
reward of his worth and service; and, moreover, he would forgive him the
money which was owing, and all reckonings besides due unto him, <q>I ask no
more, no part of booty, no portion, but Rhodanthe to be my wife.</q> And when
as he could not compass her by fair means, he fell to treachery, force and
villainy, and set his life at stake at last to accomplish his desire. 'Tis a
common humour this, a general passion of all lovers to be so affected, and
which Aemilia told Aratine, a courtier in Castilio's discourse, <q>surely
Aratine, if thou werst not so indeed, thou didst not love; ingenuously
confess, for if thou hadst been thoroughly enamoured, thou wouldst have
desired nothing more than to please thy mistress. For that is the law of
love, to will and nill the same.</q><a href="#note5378">[5378]</a><span lang="la">Tantum velle et nolle, velit nolit

<p>Undoubtedly this may be pronounced of them all, they are very slaves,
drudges for the time, madmen, fools, dizzards, <span lang="la">atrabilarii</span><a href="#note5380">[5380]</a>, beside
themselves, and as blind as beetles. Their dotage <a href="#note5381">[5381]</a>is most eminent,
<span lang="la">Amore simul et sapere ipsi Jovi non datur</span>, as Seneca holds, Jupiter
himself cannot love and be wise both together; the very best of them, if
once they be overtaken with this passion, the most staid, discreet, grave,
generous and wise, otherwise able to govern themselves, in this commit many
absurdities, many indecorums, unbefitting their gravity and persons.

Samson, David, Solomon, Hercules, Socrates, &amp;c. are justly taxed of
indiscretion in this point; the middle sort are between hawk and buzzard;
and although they do perceive and acknowledge their own dotage, weakness,
fury, yet they cannot withstand it; as well may witness those
expostulations and confessions of Dido in Virgil.

<p>The major part of lovers are carried headlong like so many brute beasts,
reason counsels one way, thy friends, fortunes, shame, disgrace, danger,
and an ocean of cares that will certainly follow; yet this furious lust
precipitates, counterpoiseth, weighs down on the other; though it be their
utter undoing, perpetual infamy, loss, yet they will do it, and become at
last <span lang="la">insensati</span>, void of sense; degenerate into dogs, hogs, asses, brutes;
as Jupiter into a bull, Apuleius an ass, Lycaon a wolf, Tereus a
lapwing,<a href="#note5387">[5387]</a>Calisto a bear, Elpenor and Grillus info swine by Circe. For
what else may we think those ingenious poets to have shadowed in their
witty fictions and poems but that a man once given over to his lust (as

of both the Indies to endow her with, a carrack of diamonds, a chain of
pearl, a cascanet of jewels, (a pair of calfskin gloves of four-pence a

have it with all his heart; he would spend myriads of crowns for her sake.

So she admires him again, in that conceited dialogue of Lucian, which John
Secundus, an elegant Dutch modern poet, hath translated into verse. When
Doris and those other sea nymphs upbraided her with her ugly misshapen
lover, Polyphemus; she replies, they speak out of envy and malice,
<div class="poem" lang="la">

Say what they could, he was a proper man. And as Heloise writ to her
sweetheart Peter Abelard, <span lang="la">Si me Augustus orbis imperator uxorem expeteret,
mallem tua esse meretrix quam orbis imperatrix</span>; she had rather be his
vassal, his quean, than the world's empress or queen.&mdash;<span lang="la">non si me Jupiter
ipse forte velit</span>,&mdash;she would not change her love for Jupiter himself.

<p>To thy thinking she is a most loathsome creature; and as when a country
fellow discommended once that exquisite picture of Helen, made by Zeuxis,
<a href="#note5406">[5406]</a>for he saw no such beauty in it; Nichomachus a lovesick spectator
replied, <span lang="la">Sume tibi meos oculos et deam existimabis</span>, take mine eyes, and
thou wilt think she is a goddess, dote on her forthwith, count all her
vices virtues; her imperfections infirmities, absolute and perfect: if she
be flat-nosed, she is lovely; if hook-nosed, kingly; if dwarfish and
little, pretty; if tall, proper and man-like, our brave British Boadicea;
if crooked, wise; if monstrous, comely; her defects are no defects at all,
she hath no deformities. <span lang="la">Immo nec ipsum amicae stercus foetet</span>, though she
be nasty, fulsome, as Sostratus' bitch, or Parmeno's sow; thou hadst as
live have a snake in thy bosom, a toad in thy dish, and callest her witch,
devil, hag, with all the filthy names thou canst invent; he admires her on
the other side, she is his idol, lady, mistress, <a href="#note5407">[5407]</a>venerilla, queen,
the quintessence of beauty, an angel, a star, a goddess.

I could repeat centuries of such. Now tell me what greater dotage or
blindness can there be than this in both sexes? and yet their slavery is
more eminent, a greater sign of their folly than the rest.

<p>They are commonly slaves, captives, voluntary servants, <span lang="la">Amator amicae
mancipium</span>, as <a href="#note5420">[5420]</a>Castilio terms him, his mistress' servant, her
drudge, prisoner, bondman, what not? <q>He composeth himself wholly to her
affections to please her, and, as Aemelia said, makes himself her lackey.
All his cares, actions, all his thoughts, are subordinate to her will and
commandment:</q> her most devote, obsequious, affectionate servant and vassal.
<q>For love</q> (as <a href="#note5421">[5421]</a>Cyrus in Xenophon well observed) <q>is a mere tyranny,
worse than any disease, and they that are troubled with it desire to be
free and cannot, but are harder bound than if they were in iron chains.</q>
What greater captivity or slavery can there be (as <a href="#note5422">[5422]</a>Tully
expostulates) than to be in love? <q>Is he a free man over whom a woman
domineers, to whom she prescribes laws, commands, forbids what she will
herself; that dares deny nothing she demands; she asks, he gives; she
calls, he comes; she threatens, he fears; <span lang="la">Nequissimum hunc servum puto</span>, I
account this man a very drudge.</q> And as he follows it, <a href="#note5423">[5423]</a><q>Is this no
small servitude for an enamourite to be every hour combing his head,
stiffening his beard, perfuming his hair, washing his face with sweet
water, painting, curling, and not to come abroad but sprucely crowned,
decked, and apparelled?</q> Yet these are but toys in respect, to go to the
barber, baths, theatres, &amp;c., he must attend upon her wherever she goes,
run along the streets by her doors and windows to see her, take all
opportunities, sleeveless errands, disguise, counterfeit shapes, and as
many forms as Jupiter himself ever took; and come every day to her house
(as he will surely do if he be truly enamoured) and offer her service, and
follow her up and down from room to room, as Lucretia's suitors did, he
cannot contain himself but he will do it, he must and will be where she is,
sit next her, still talking with her. <a href="#note5424">[5424]</a><q>If I did but let my glove
fall by chance,</q> (as the said Aretine's Lucretia brags,) <q>I had one of my
suitors, nay two or three at once ready to stoop and take it up, and kiss
it, and with a low conge deliver it unto me; if I would walk, another was
ready to sustain me by the arm. A third to provide fruits, pears, plums,
cherries, or whatsoever I would eat or drink.</q> All this and much more he
doth in her presence, and when he comes home, as Troilus to his Cressida,
'tis all his meditation to recount with himself his actions, words,
gestures, what entertainment he had, how kindly she used him in such a
place, how she smiled, how she graced him, and that infinitely pleased him;
and then he breaks out, O sweet Areusa, O my dearest Antiphila, O most
divine looks, O lovely graces, and thereupon instantly he makes an epigram,
or a sonnet to five or seven tunes, in her commendation, or else he
ruminates how she rejected his service, denied him a kiss, disgraced him,
&amp;c., and that as effectually torments him. And these are his exercises
between comb and glass, madrigals, elegies, &amp;c., these his cogitations till
he see her again. But all this is easy and gentle, and the least part of
his labour and bondage, no hunter will take such pains for his game, fowler
for his sport, or soldier to sack a city, as he will for his mistress'
favour.

As Phaedra to Hippolitus. No danger shall affright, for if that be true the
poets feign, Love is the son of Mars and Venus; as he hath delights,
pleasures, elegances from his mother, so hath he hardness, valour, and
boldness from his father. And 'tis true that Bernard hath; <span lang="la">Amore nihil
mollius, nihil volentius</span>, nothing so boisterous, nothing so tender as
love. If once, therefore, enamoured, he will go, run, ride many a mile to
meet her, day and night, in a very dark night, endure scorching heat, cold,
wait in frost and snow, rain, tempest, till his teeth chatter in his head,
those northern winds and showers cannot cool or quench his flame of love.
<span lang="la">Intempesta nocte non deterretur</span>, he will, take my word, sustain hunger,
thirst, <span lang="la">Penetrabit omnia, perrumpet omnia</span>, <q>love will find out a way,</q>
through thick and thin he will to her, <span lang="la">Expeditissimi montes videntur omnes

Apennines, or Pyrenean hills,

though it rain daggers with their points downward, light or dark, all is
one: (<span lang="la">Roscida per tenebras Faunus ad antra venit</span>), for her sweet sake he
will undertake Hercules's twelve labours, endure, hazard, &amp;c., he feels it
not. <a href="#note5427">[5427]</a><q>What shall I say,</q> saith Haedus, <q>of their great dangers they
undergo, single combats they undertake, how they will venture their lives,
creep in at windows, gutters, climb over walls to come to their
sweethearts,</q> (anointing the doors and hinges with oil, because they should
not creak, tread soft, swim, wade, watch, &amp;c.), <q>and if they be surprised,
leap out at windows, cast themselves headlong down, bruising or breaking
their legs or arms, and sometimes loosing life itself,</q> as Calisto did for
his lovely Melibaea. Hear some of their own confessions, protestations,
complaints, proffers, expostulations, wishes, brutish attempts, labours in
this kind. Hercules served Omphale, put on an apron, took a distaff and
spun; Thraso the soldier was so submissive to Thais, that he was resolved
to do whatever she enjoined. <a href="#note5428">[5428]</a><span lang="la">Ego me Thaidi dedam; et faciam quod
jubet</span>, I am at her service. Philostratus in an epistle to his mistress,
<a href="#note5429">[5429]</a><q>I am ready to die sweetheart if it be thy will; allay his thirst
whom thy star hath scorched and undone, the fountains and rivers deny no
man drink that comes; the fountain doth not say thou shalt not drink, nor
the apple thou shalt not eat, nor the fair meadow walk not in me, but thou
alone wilt not let me come near thee, or see thee, contemned and despised I
die for grief.</q> Polienus, when his mistress Circe did but frown upon him in
Petronius, drew his sword, and bade her <a href="#note5430">[5430]</a>kill, stab, or whip him to
death, he would strip himself naked, and not resist. Another will take a
journey to Japan, <span lang="la">Longae navigationis molestis non curans</span>: a third (if
she say it) will not speak a word for a twelvemonth's space, her command
shall be most inviolably kept: a fourth will take Hercules's club from him,
and with that centurion in the Spanish <a href="#note5431">[5431]</a>Caelestina, will kill ten men
for his mistress Areusa, for a word of her mouth he will cut bucklers in
two like pippins, and flap down men like flies, <span lang="la">Elige quo mortis genere
illum occidi cupis</span>? <a href="#note5432">[5432]</a>Galeatus of Mantua did a little more: for when
he was almost mad for love of a fair maid in the city, she, to try him
belike what he would do for her sake, bade him in jest leap into the river
Po if he loved her; he forthwith did leap headlong off the bridge and was
drowned. Another at Ficinum in like passion, when his mistress by chance
(thinking no harm I dare swear) bade him go hang, the next night at her
doors hanged himself. <a href="#note5433">[5433]</a><q>Money</q> (saith Xenophon) <q>is a very acceptable
and welcome guest, yet I had rather give it my dear Clinia than take it of
others, I had rather serve him than command others, I had rather be his
drudge than take my ease, undergo any danger for his sake than live in
security. For I had rather see Clinia than all the world besides, and had
rather want the sight of all other things than him alone; I am angry with
the night and sleep that I may not see him, and thank the light and sun
because they show me my Clinia; I will run into the fire for his sake, and
if you did but see him, I know that you likewise would run with me.</q> So
Philostratus to his mistress, <a href="#note5434">[5434]</a><q>Command me what you will, I will do
it; bid me go to sea, I am gone in an instant, take so many stripes, I am
ready, run through the fire, and lay down my life and soul at thy feet, 'tis
done.</q> So did. Aeolus to Juno.

God of Heaven, grant me this life for ever to sit over against my mistress,
and to hear her sweet voice, to go in and out with her, to have every other
business common with her; I would labour when she labours; sail when she
sails; he that hates her should hate me; and if a tyrant kill her, he
should kill me; if she should die, I would not live, and one grave should
hold us both.</q> <a href="#note5438">[5438]</a><span lang="la">Finiet illa meos moriens morientis amores</span>.
Abrocomus in <a href="#note5439">[5439]</a>Aristaenetus makes the like petition for his Delphia,

thee, and I am ready to die with thee.</q> 'Tis the same strain which
Theagines used to his Chariclea, <q>so that I may but enjoy thy love, let me
die presently:</q> Leander to his Hero, when he besought the sea waves to let
him go quietly to his love, and kill him coming back. <a href="#note5441">[5441]</a><span lang="la">Parcite dum
propero, mergite dum redeo</span>. <q>Spare me whilst I go, drown me as I return.</q>
'Tis the common humour of them all, to contemn death, to wish for death, to
confront death in this case, <span lang="la">Quippe queis nec fera, nec ignis, neque
praecipitium, nec fretum, nec ensis, neque laqueus gravia videntur</span>; <q>'Tis

<q>He does not fear death, he desireth such upon the very swords.</q> Though a
thousand dragons or devils keep the gates, Cerberus himself, Scyron and
Procrastes lay in wait, and the way as dangerous, as inaccessible as hell,
through fiery flames and over burning coulters, he will adventure for all
this. And as <a href="#note5442">[5442]</a>Peter Abelard lost his testicles for his Heloise, he
will I say not venture an incision, but life itself. For how many gallants
offered to lose their lives for a night's lodging with Cleopatra in those
days! and in the hour or moment of death, 'tis their sole comfort to
remember their dear mistress, as <a href="#note5443">[5443]</a>Zerbino slain in France, and

Hippodamias' sake, the daughter of Onomaus, king of Elis: when that hard
condition was proposed of death or victory, they made no account of it, but
courageously for love died, till Pelops at last won her by a sleight.

St. George freed the king's daughter of Sabea (the golden legend is mine

he is a very dastard, a coward, a block and a beast, that will not do as
much, but they will sure, they will; for it is an ordinary thing for these

blood, <a href="#note5448">[5448]</a>or as that Thessalian Thero, that bit off his own thumb,
<span lang="la">provocans rivalem ad hoc aemulandum</span>, to make his co-rival do as much. 'Tis

and in her quarrel, to fight so long <a href="#note5450">[5450]</a><q>till their headpiece,
bucklers be all broken, and swords hacked like so many saws,</q> for they must
not see her abused in any sort, 'tis blasphemy to speak against her, a
dishonour without all good respect to name her. 'Tis common with these
creatures, to drink <a href="#note5451">[5451]</a>healths upon their bare knees, though it were a
mile to the bottom, no matter of what mixture, off it comes. If she bid
them they will go barefoot to Jerusalem, to the great Cham's court, <a href="#note5452">[5452]</a>
to the East Indies, to fetch her a bird to wear in her hat: and with Drake
and Candish sail round about the world for her sweet sake, <span lang="la">adversis

<a href="#note5453">[5453]</a>Gesmunda, the daughter of Tancredus, prince of Salerna, did for
Guisardus, her true love, eat his heart when he died; or as Artemisia drank
her husband's bones beaten to powder, and so bury him in herself, and
endure more torments than Theseus or Paris. <span lang="la">Et his colitur Venus magis
quam thure, et victimis</span>, with such sacrifices as these (as <a href="#note5454">[5454]</a>
Aristaenetus holds) Venus is well pleased. Generally they undertake any
pain, any labour, any toil, for their mistress' sake, love and admire a
servant, not to her alone, but to all her friends and followers, they hug
and embrace them for her sake; her dog, picture, and everything she wears,
they adore it as a relic. If any man come from her, they feast him, reward
him, will not be out of his company, do him all offices, still remembering,
still talking of her:
<div class="poem" lang="la">

<p>The very carrier that comes from him to her is a most welcome guest; and if
he bring a letter, she will read it twenty times over, and as <a href="#note5456">[5456]</a>
Lucretia did by Euryalus, <q>kiss the letter a thousand times together, and
then read it:</q> And <a href="#note5457">[5457]</a>Chelidonia by Philonius, after many sweet kisses,
put the letter in her bosom,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">And kiss again, and often look thereon,</div>
<div class="line">And stay the messenger that would be gone:</div>
</div>
And asked many pretty questions, over and over again, as how he looked,
what he did, and what he said? In a word,

off it; as Laodamia did by Protesilaus, when he went to war, <a href="#note5460">[5460]</a><q>'sit
at home with his picture before her;' a garter or a bracelet of hers is
more precious than any saint's relic,</q> he lays it up in his casket, (O
blessed relic) and every day will kiss it: if in her presence, his eye is
never off her, and drink he will where she drank, if it be possible, in
that very place, &amp;c. If absent, he will walk in the walk, sit under that
tree where she did use to sit, in that bower, in that very seat,&mdash;<span lang="la">et
foribus miser oscula figit</span>, <a href="#note5461">[5461]</a>many years after sometimes, though she
be far distant and dwell many miles off, he loves yet to walk that way
still, to have his chamber-window look that way: to walk by that river's
side, which (though far away) runs by the house where she dwells, he loves
the wind blows to that coast.

opportunity to see her, O that he might but enjoy her presence! So did
Philostratus to his mistress, <a href="#note5466">[5466]</a><q>O happy ground on which she treads,

the sun fallen down to shine below, and thee to shine in his place, whom I
desire. If I look upon the night, methinks I see two more glorious stars,
Hesperus and thyself.</q> A little after he thus courts his mistress, <a href="#note5468">[5468]</a>
<q>If thou goest forth of the city, the protecting gods that keep the town
will run after to gaze upon thee: if thou sail upon the seas, as so many
small boats, they will follow thee: what river would not run into the sea?</q>
Another, he sighs and sobs, swears he hath <span lang="la">Cor scissum</span>, a heart bruised
to powder, dissolved and melted within him, or quite gone from him, to his

scorched with love's heat; he wisheth himself a saddle for her to sit on, a
posy for her to smell to, and it would not grieve him to be hanged, if he
might be strangled in her garters: he would willingly die tomorrow, so

The very Gods will endure any shame (<span lang="la">atque aliquis de diis non tristibus

But who can reckon upon the dotage, madness, servitude and blindness, the
foolish phantasms and vanities of lovers, their torments, wishes, idle
attempts?

<p>Yet for all this, amongst so many irksome, absurd, troublesome symptoms,
inconveniences, fantastical fits and passions which are usually incident
to such persons, there be some good and graceful qualities in lovers, which
this affection causeth. <q>As it makes wise men fools, so many times it makes
fools become wise; <a href="#note5486">[5486]</a>it makes base fellows become generous, cowards
courageous,</q> as Cardan notes out of Plutarch; <q>covetous, liberal and
magnificent; clowns, civil; cruel, gentle; wicked, profane persons, to
become religious; slovens, neat; churls, merciful; and dumb dogs, eloquent;
your lazy drones, quick and nimble.</q> <span lang="la">Feras mentes domat cupido</span>, that
fierce, cruel and rude Cyclops Polyphemus sighed, and shed many a salt tear
for Galatea's sake. No passion causeth greater alterations, or more
vehement of joy or discontent. Plutarch. <span class="cite">Sympos. lib. 5. quaest. 1</span>, <a href="#note5487">[5487]</a>
saith, <q>that the soul of a man in love is full of perfumes and sweet
odours, and all manner of pleasing tones and tunes, insomuch that it is
hard to say (as he adds) whether love do mortal men more harm than good.</q>
It adds spirits and makes them, otherwise soft and silly, generous and
courageous, <a href="#note5488">[5488]</a><span lang="la">Audacem faciebat amor</span>. Ariadne's love made Theseus so
adventurous, and Medea's beauty Jason so victorious; <span lang="la">expectorat amor
timorem</span>. <a href="#note5489">[5489]</a>Plato is of opinion that the love of Venus made Mars so
valorous. <q>A young man will be much abashed to commit any foul offence that
shall come to the hearing or sight of his mistress.</q> As <a href="#note5490">[5490]</a>he that
desired of his enemy now dying, to lay him with his face upward, <span lang="la">ne
amasius videret eum a tergo vulneratum</span>, lest his sweetheart should say he
was a coward. <q>And if it were <a href="#note5491">[5491]</a>possible to have an army consist of
lovers, such as love, or are beloved, they would be extraordinary valiant
and wise in their government, modesty would detain them from doing amiss,
emulation incite them to do that which is good and honest, and a few of
them would overcome a great company of others.</q> There is no man so
pusillanimous, so very a dastard, whom love would not incense, make of a
divine temper, and an heroical spirit. As he said in like case, <a href="#note5492">[5492]</a>
<span lang="la">Tota ruat caeli moles, non terreor</span>, &amp;c. Nothing can terrify, nothing can
dismay them. But as Sir Blandimor and Paridel, those two brave fairy
knights, fought for the love of fair Florimel in presence&mdash;
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5493">[5493]</a>And drawing both their swords with rage anew,</div>
<div class="line">Like two mad mastives each other slew,</div>
<div class="line">And shields did share, and males did rash, and helms did hew;</div>
<div class="line">So furiously each other did assail,</div>
<div class="line">As if their souls at once they would have rent,</div>
<div class="line">Out of their breasts, that streams of blood did trail</div>
<div class="line">Adown as if their springs of life were spent,</div>
<div class="line">That all the ground with purple blood was sprent,</div>
<div class="line">And all their armour stain'd with bloody gore,</div>
<div class="line">Yet scarcely once to breath would they relent.</div>
<div class="line">So mortal was their malice and so sore,</div>
<div class="line">That both resolved (than yield) to die before.</div>
</div>
Every base swain in love will dare to do as much for his dear mistress'
sake. He will fight and fetch, <a href="#note5494">[5494]</a>Argivum Clypeum, that famous buckler
of Argos, to do her service, adventure at all, undertake any enterprise.
And as Serranus the Spaniard, then Governor of Sluys, made answer to
Marquess Spinola, if the enemy brought 50,000 devils against him he would
keep it. The nine worthies, Oliver and Rowland, and forty dozen of peers
are all in him, he is all mettle, armour of proof, more than a man, and in
this case improved beyond himself. For as <a href="#note5495">[5495]</a>Agatho contends, a true
lover is wise, just, temperate, and valiant. <a href="#note5496">[5496]</a><q>I doubt not,
therefore, but if a man had such an army of lovers</q> (as Castilio supposeth)
<q>he might soon conquer all the world, except by chance he met with such
another army of inamoratos to oppose it.</q> <a href="#note5497">[5497]</a>For so perhaps they might
fight as that fatal dog and fatal hare in the heavens, course one another
round, and never make an end. Castilio thinks Ferdinand King of Spain would
never have conquered Granada, had not Queen Isabel and her ladies been
present at the siege: <a href="#note5498">[5498]</a><q>It cannot be expressed what courage the
Spanish knights took, when the ladies were present, a few Spaniards
overcame a multitude of Moors.</q> They will undergo any danger whatsoever, as
Sir Walter Manny in Edward the Third's time, stuck full of ladies' favours,
fought like a dragon. For <span lang="la">soli amantes</span>, as <a href="#note5499">[5499]</a>Plato holds, <span lang="la">pro
amicis mori appetunt</span>, only lovers will die for their friends, and in their
mistress' quarrel. And for that cause he would have women follow the camp,
to be spectators and encouragers of noble actions: upon such an occasion,
the <a href="#note5500">[5500]</a>Squire of Dames himself, Sir Lancelot or Sir Tristram, Caesar, or
Alexander, shall not be more resolute or go beyond them.

<p>Not courage only doth love add, but as I said, subtlety, wit, and many
pretty devices, <a href="#note5501">[5501]</a><span lang="la">Namque dolos inspirat amor, fraudesque ministrat</span>,
<a href="#note5502">[5502]</a>Jupiter in love with Leda, and not knowing how to compass his
desire, turned himself into a swan, and got Venus to pursue him in the
likeness of an eagle; which she doing, for shelter, he fled to Leda's lap,
<span lang="la">et in ejus gremio se collocavit</span>, Leda embraced him, and so fell fast
asleep, <span lang="la">sed dormientem Jupiter compressit</span>, by which means Jupiter had his
will. Infinite such tricks love can devise, such fine feats in abundance,
with wisdom and wariness, <a href="#note5503">[5503]</a><span lang="la">quis fallere possit amantem</span>. All manner
of civility, decency, compliment and good behaviour, <span lang="la">plus solis et
leporis</span>, polite graces and merry conceits. Boccaccio hath a pleasant tale
to this purpose, which he borrowed from the Greeks, and which Beroaldus
hath turned into Latin, Bebelius in verse, of Cymon and Iphigenia. This
Cymon was a fool, a proper man of person, and the governor of Cyprus' son.
but a very ass, insomuch that his father being ashamed of him, sent him to
a farmhouse he had in the country, to be brought up. Where by chance, as
his manner was, walking alone, he espied a gallant young gentlewoman, named
Iphigenia, a burgomaster's daughter of Cyprus, with her maid, by a brook
side in a little thicket, fast asleep in her smock, where she had newly
bathed herself: <q>When <a href="#note5504">[5504]</a>Cymon saw her, he stood leaning on his staff,
gaping on her immovable, and in amaze;</q> at last he fell so far in love
with the glorious object, that he began to rouse himself up, to bethink
what he was, would needs follow her to the city, and for her sake began to
be civil, to learn to sing and dance, to play on instruments, and got all
those gentlemanlike qualities and compliments in a short space, which his
friends were most glad of. In brief, he became, from an idiot and a clown,
to be one of the most complete gentlemen in Cyprus, did many valorous
exploits, and all for the love of mistress Iphigenia. In a word, I may say
thus much of them all, let them be never so clownish, rude and horrid,
Grobians and sluts, if once they be in love they will be most neat and
spruce; for, <a href="#note5505">[5505]</a><span lang="la">Omnibus rebus, et nitidis nitoribus antevenit amor</span>,
they will follow the fashion, begin to trick up, and to have a good opinion
of themselves, <span lang="la">venustatem enim mater Venus</span>; a ship is not so long a
rigging as a young gentlewoman a trimming up herself against her sweetheart
comes. A painter's shop, a flowery meadow, no so gracious aspect in
nature's storehouse as a young maid, <span lang="la">nubilis puella</span>, a Novitsa or
Venetian bride, that looks for a husband, or a young man that is her
suitor; composed looks, composed gait, clothes, gestures, actions, all
composed; all the graces, elegances in the world are in her face. Their
best robes, ribands, chains, jewels, lawns, linens, laces, spangles, must
come on, <a href="#note5506">[5506]</a><span lang="la">praeter quam res patitur student elegantiae</span>, they are
beyond all measure coy, nice, and too curious on a sudden; 'tis all their
study, all their business, how to wear their clothes neat, to be polite and
terse, and to set out themselves. No sooner doth a young man see his
sweetheart coming, but he smugs up himself, pulls up his cloak now fallen
about his shoulders, ties his garters, points, sets his band, cuffs, slicks
his hair, twires his beard, &amp;c. When Mercury was to come before his
mistress,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5507">[5507]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Chlamydemque ut pendeat apte</div>

</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">He put his cloak in order, that the lace.</div>
<div class="line">And hem, and gold-work, all might have his grace.</div>
</div>

<p>Salmacis would not be seen of Hermaphroditus, till she had spruced up
herself first,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5508">[5508]</a>Nec tamen ante adiit, etsi properabat adire,</div>
<div class="line">Quam se composuit, quam circumspexit amictus,</div>

</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Nor did she come, although 'twas her desire,</div>
<div class="line">Till she compos'd herself, and trimm'd her tire,</div>
<div class="line">And set her looks to make him to admire.</div>
</div>

<p>Venus had so ordered the matter, that when her son <a href="#note5509">[5509]</a>Aeneas was to
appear before Queen Dido, he was
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">(Os humerosque deo similis (namque ipsa decoram</div>
<div class="line">Caesariem nato genetrix, lumenque juventae</div>
<div class="line">Purpureum et laetos oculis afflarat honores.)</div>
</div>
like a god, for she was the tire-woman herself, to set him out with all
natural and artificial impostures. As mother Mammea did her son
Heliogabalus, new chosen emperor, when he was to be seen of the people
first. When the hirsute cyclopical Polyphemus courted Galatea;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5510">[5510]</a>Jamque tibi formae, jamque est tibi cura placendi,</div>
<div class="line">Jam rigidos pectis rastris Polypheme capillos,</div>
<div class="line">Jam libet hirsutam tibi falce recidere barbam,</div>
<div class="line">Et spectare feros in aqua et componere vultus.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">And then he did begin to prank himself,</div>
<div class="line">To plait and comb his head, and beard to shave,</div>
<div class="line">And look his face i' th' water as a glass,</div>
<div class="line">And to compose himself for to be brave.</div>
</div>
He was upon a sudden now spruce and keen, as a new ground hatchet. He now
began to have a good opinion of his own features and good parts, now to be a gallant.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Jam Galatea veni, nec munera despice nostra,</div>
<div class="line">Certe ego me novi, liquidaque in imagine vidi</div>
<div class="line">Nuper aquae, placuitque mihi mea forma videnti.</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Come now, my Galatea, scorn me not,</div>

</div>
<p>'Tis the common humour of all suitors to trick up themselves, to be
prodigal in apparel, <span lang="la">pure lotus</span>, neat, combed, and curled, with powdered
hair, <span lang="la">comptus et calimistratus</span>, with a long love-lock, a flower in his
ear, perfumed gloves, rings, scarves, feathers, points, &amp;c. as if he were a
prince's Ganymede, with everyday new suits, as the fashion varies; going as
if he trod upon eggs, as Heinsius writ to Primierus, <a href="#note5512">[5512]</a><q>if once he be
besotten on a wench, he must like awake at nights, renounce his book, sigh
and lament, now and then weep for his hard hap, and mark above all things
what hats, bands, doublets, breeches, are in fashion, how to cut his beard,
and wear his locks, to turn up his mustachios, and curl his head, prune his
pickedevant, or if he wear it abroad, that the east side be correspondent
to the west;</q> he may be scoffed at otherwise, as Julian that apostate
emperor was for wearing a long hirsute goatish beard, fit to make ropes
with, as in his Mysopogone, or that apologetical oration he made at Antioch
to excuse himself, he doth ironically confess, it hindered his kissing,
<span lang="la">nam non licuit inde pura puris, eoque suavioribus labra labris adjungere</span>,
but he did not much esteem it, as it seems by the sequel, <span lang="la">de accipiendis
dandisve osculis non laboro</span>, yet (to follow mine author) it may much
concern a young lover, he must be more respectful in this behalf, <q>he must
be in league with an excellent tailor, barber,</q>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5513">[5513]</a>Tonsorem pucrum sed arte talem,</div>

</div>
<q>have neat shoe-ties, points, garters, speak in print, walk in print, eat
and drink in print, and that which is all in all, he must be mad in print.</q>

<p>Amongst other good qualities an amorous fellow is endowed with, he must
learn to sing and dance, play upon some instrument or other, as without all
doubt he will, if he be truly touched with this loadstone of love. For as
<a href="#note5514">[5514]</a>Erasmus hath it, <span lang="la">Musicam docet amor et Poesia</span>, love will make them
musicians, and to compose ditties, madrigals, elegies, love sonnets, and
sing them to several pretty tunes, to get all good qualities may be had.
<a href="#note5515">[5515]</a>Jupiter perceived Mercury to be in love with Philologia, because he
learned languages, polite speech, (for Suadela herself was Venus' daughter,
as some write) arts and sciences, <span lang="la">quo virgini placeret</span>, all to ingratiate
himself, and please his mistress. 'Tis their chiefest study to sing, dance;
and without question, so many gentlemen and gentlewomen would not be so
well qualified in this kind, if love did not incite them. <a href="#note5516">[5516]</a><q>Who,</q>
saith Castilio, <q>would learn to play, or give his mind to music, learn to
dance, or make so many rhymes, love-songs, as most do, but for women's
sake, because they hope by that means to purchase their good wills, and win
their favour?</q> We see this daily verified in our young women and wives,
they that being maids took so much pains to sing, play, and dance, with
such cost and charge to their parents, to get those graceful qualities, now
being married will scarce touch an instrument, they care not for it.
Constantine <span class="cite">agricult. lib. 11. cap. 18</span>, makes Cupid himself to be a great
dancer; by the same token as he was capering amongst the gods, <a href="#note5517">[5517]</a><q>he
flung down a bowl of nectar, which distilling upon the white rose, ever
since made it red:</q> and Calistratus, by the help of Dedalus, about Cupid's
statue <a href="#note5518">[5518]</a>made a many of young wenches still a dancing, to signify
belike that Cupid was much affected with it, as without all doubt he was.
For at his and Psyche's wedding, the gods being present to grace the feast,
Ganymede filled nectar in abundance (as <a href="#note5519">[5519]</a>Apuleius describes it),
Vulcan was the cook, the Hours made all fine with roses and flowers, Apollo
played on the harp, the Muses sang to it, <span lang="la">sed suavi Musicae super ingressa
Venus saltavit</span>, but his mother Venus danced to his and their sweet
content. Witty <a href="#note5520">[5520]</a>Lucian in that pathetical love passage, or pleasant
description of Jupiter's stealing of Europa, and swimming from Phoenicia to
Crete, makes the sea calm, the winds hush, Neptune and Amphitrite riding in
their chariot to break the waves before them, the tritons dancing round
about, with every one a torch, the sea-nymphs half naked, keeping time on
dolphins' backs, and singing Hymeneus, Cupid nimbly tripping on the top of
the waters, and Venus herself coming after in a shell, strewing roses and
flowers on their heads. Praxiteles, in all his pictures of love, feigns
Cupid ever smiling, and looking upon dancers; and in St. Mark's in Rome
(whose work I know not), one of the most delicious pieces, is a many of
<a href="#note5521">[5521]</a>satyrs dancing about a wench asleep. So that dancing still is as it
were a necessary appendix to love matters. Young lasses are never better
pleased than when as upon a holiday, after evensong, they may meet their
sweethearts, and dance about a maypole, or in a town-green under a shady
elm. Nothing so familiar in. <a href="#note5522">[5522]</a>France, as for citizens' wives and
maids to dance a round in the streets, and often too, for want of better
instruments, to make good music of their own voices, and dance after it.
Yea many times this love will make old men and women that have more toes
than teeth, dance,&mdash;<q>John, come kiss me now,</q> mask and mum; for Comus and
Hymen love masks, and all such merriments above measure, will allow men to
put on women's apparel in some cases, and promiscuously to dance, young and
old, rich and poor, generous and base, of all sorts. Paulus Jovius taxeth
Augustine Niphus the philosopher, <a href="#note5523">[5523]</a><q>for that being an old man, and a
public professor, a father of many children, he was so mad for the love of
a young maid (that which many of his friends were ashamed to see), an old
gouty fellow, yet would dance after fiddlers.</q> Many laughed him to scorn
for it, but this omnipotent love would have it so.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5524">[5524]</a>Hyacinthino bacillo</div>
<div class="line">Properans amor, me adegit</div>
<div class="line">Violenter ad sequendum.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Love hasty with his purple staff did make</div>
<div class="line">Me follow and the dance to undertake.</div>
</div>
And 'tis no news this, no indecorum; for why? a good reason may be given of
it. Cupid and death met both in an inn; and being merrily disposed, they
did exchange some arrows from either quiver; ever since young men die, and
oftentimes old men dote&mdash;<a href="#note5525">[5525]</a><span lang="la">Sic moritur Juvenis, sic moribundus
amat</span>. And who can then withstand it? If once we be in love, young or old,
though our teeth shake in our heads, like virginal jacks, or stand parallel
asunder like the arches of a bridge, there is no remedy, we must dance
trenchmore for a need, over tables, chairs, and stools, &amp;c. And princum
prancum is a fine dance. Plutarch, <span class="cite">Sympos. 1. quaest. 5.</span> doth in some sort
excuse it, and telleth us moreover in what sense, <span lang="la">Musicam docet amor,
licet prius fuerit rudis</span>, how love makes them that had no skill before
learn to sing and dance; he concludes, 'tis only that power and prerogative
love hath over us. <a href="#note5526">[5526]</a><q>Love</q> (as he holds) <q>will make a silent man speak,
a modest man most officious; dull, quick; slow, nimble; and that which is
most to be admired, a hard, base, untractable churl, as fire doth iron in a
smith's forge, free, facile, gentle, and easy to be entreated.</q> Nay, 'twill
make him prodigal in the other extreme, and give a <a href="#note5527">[5527]</a>hundred sesterces
for a night's lodging, as they did of old to Lais of Corinth, or <a href="#note5528">[5528]</a>
<span lang="la">ducenta drachmarum millia pro unica nocte</span>, as Mundus to Paulina, spend
all his fortunes (as too many do in like case) to obtain his suit. For
which cause many compare love to wine, which makes men jovial and merry,
frolic and sad, whine, sing, dance, and what not.

<p>But above all the other symptoms of lovers, this is not lightly to be
overpassed, that likely of what condition soever, if once they be in love,
they turn to their ability, rhymers, ballad makers, and poets. For as
Plutarch saith, <a href="#note5529">[5529]</a><q>They will be witnesses and trumpeters of their
paramours' good parts, bedecking them with verses and commendatory songs,
as we do statues with gold, that they may be remembered and admired of
all.</q> Ancient men will dote in this kind sometimes as well as the rest; the
heat of love will thaw their frozen affections, dissolve the ice of age,
and so far enable them, though they be sixty years of age above the girdle,
to be scarce thirty beneath. Jovianus Pontanus makes an old fool rhyme, and
turn poetaster to please his mistress.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

They will be still singing amorous songs and ditties (if young especially),
and cannot abstain though it be when they go to, or should be at church. We
have a pretty story to this purpose in <a href="#note5531">[5531]</a>Westmonasteriensis, an old
writer of ours (if you will believe it) <i>An. Dom.</i> 1012. at Colewiz in
Saxony, on Christmas eve a company of young men and maids, whilst the
priest was at mass in the church, were singing catches and love songs in
the churchyard, he sent to them to make less noise, but they sung on still:

This they sung, he chaft, till at length, impatient as he was, he prayed to
St. Magnus, patron of the church, they might all three sing and dance till
that time twelvemonth, and so <a href="#note5532">[5532]</a>they did without meat and drink,
wearisomeness or giving over, till at year's end they ceased singing, and
were absolved by Herebertus archbishop of Cologne. They will in all places
be doing thus, young folks especially, reading love stories, talking of
this or that young man, such a fair maid, singing, telling or hearing
lascivious tales, scurrilous tunes, such objects are their sole delight,
their continual meditation, and as Guastavinius adds, <span class="cite">Com. in 4. Sect. 27.
Prov. Arist.</span> <span lang="la">ob seminis abundantiam crebrae cogitationes, veneris frequens

<span lang="la">pruriens corpus, pruriens anima</span>, amorous conceits, tickling thoughts,
sweet and pleasant hopes; hence it is, they can think, discourse willingly,
or speak almost of no other subject. 'Tis their only desire, if it may be
done by art, to see their husband's picture in a glass, they'll give
anything to know when they shall be married, how many husbands they shall
have, by cromnyomantia, a kind of divination with <a href="#note5533">[5533]</a>onions laid on the
altar on Christmas eve, or by fasting on St. Anne's eve or night, to know
who shall be their first husband, or by amphitormantia, by beans in a cake,
&amp;c., to burn the same. This love is the cause of all good conceits, <a href="#note5534">[5534]</a>
neatness, exornations, plays, elegancies, delights, pleasant expressions,
sweet motions, and gestures, joys, comforts, exultancies, and all the
sweetness of our life, <a href="#note5535">[5535]</a><span lang="la">qualis jam vita foret, aut quid jucundi sine
aurea Venere</span>? <a href="#note5536">[5536]</a><span lang="la">Emoriar cum ista non amplius mihi cura fuerit</span>, let
me live no longer than I may love, saith a mad merry fellow in Mimnermus.
This love is that salt that seasoneth our harsh and dull labours, and gives
a pleasant relish to our other unsavoury proceedings, <a href="#note5537">[5537]</a><span lang="la">Absit amor,
surgunt tenebrae, torpedo, veternum, pestis</span>, &amp;c. All our feasts almost,
masques, mummings, banquets, merry meetings, weddings, pleasing songs, fine
tunes, poems, love stories, plays, comedies, Atellans, jigs, Fescennines,
elegies, odes, &amp;c. proceed hence. <a href="#note5538">[5538]</a>Danaus, the son of Belus, at his
daughter's wedding at Argos, instituted the first plays (some say) that
ever were heard of symbols, emblems, impresses, devices, if we shall
believe Jovius, Coutiles, Paradine, Camillus de Camillis, may be ascribed
to it. Most of our arts and sciences, painting amongst the rest, was first
invented, saith <a href="#note5539">[5539]</a>Patritius <span lang="la">ex amoris beneficio</span>, for love's sake.
For when the daughter of <a href="#note5540">[5540]</a>Deburiades the Sycionian, was to take leave
of her sweetheart now going to wars, <span lang="la">ut desiderio ejus minus tabesceret</span>,
to comfort herself in his absence, she took his picture with coal upon a
wall, as the candle gave the shadow, which her father admiring, perfected
afterwards, and it was the first picture by report that ever was made. And
long after, Sycion for painting, carving, statuary, music, and philosophy,
was preferred before all the cities in Greece. <a href="#note5541">[5541]</a>Apollo was the first
inventor of physic, divination, oracles; Minerva found out weaving, Vulcan
curious ironwork, Mercury letters, but who prompted all this into their
heads? Love, <span lang="la">Nunquam talia invenissent, nisi talia adamassent</span>, they loved
such things, or some party, for whose sake they were undertaken at first.
'Tis true, Vulcan made a most admirable brooch or necklace, which long
after Axion and Temenus, Phegius' sons, for the singular worth of it,
consecrated to Apollo at Delphos, but Pharyllus the tyrant stole it away,
and presented it to Ariston's wife, on whom he miserably doted (Parthenius
tells the story out of Phylarchus); but why did Vulcan make this excellent
Ouch? to give Hermione Cadmus' wife, whom he dearly loved. All our tilts
and tournaments, orders of the garter, golden fleece, &amp;c.&mdash;<span lang="la">Nobilitas sub
amore jacet</span>&mdash;owe their beginnings to love, and many of our histories. By
this means, saith Jovius, they would express their loving minds to their
mistress, and to the beholders. 'Tis the sole subject almost of poetry, all
our invention tends to it, all our songs, whatever those old Anacreons:
(and therefore Hesiod makes the Muses and Graces still follow Cupid, and as
Plutarch holds, Menander and the rest of the poets were love's priests,)
all our Greek and Latin epigrammatists, love writers. Antony Diogenes the
most ancient, whose epitome we find in Phocius Bibliotheca, Longus
Sophista, Eustathius, Achilles, Tatius, Aristaenetus, Heliodorus, Plato,
Plutarch, Lucian, Parthenius, Theodorus, Prodromus, Ovid, Catullus,
Tibullus, &amp;c. Our new Ariostoes, Boyards, Authors of Arcadia, Urania,
Faerie Queen, &amp;c. Marullus, Leotichius, Angerianus, Stroza, Secundus,
Capellanus, &amp;c. with the rest of those facete modern poets, have written in
this kind, are but as so many symptoms of love. Their whole books are a
synopsis or breviary of love, the portuous of love, legends of lovers'
lives and deaths, and of their memorable adventures, nay more, <span lang="la">quod
leguntur, quod laudantur amori debent</span>, as <a href="#note5542">[5542]</a>Nevisanus the lawyer
holds, <q>there never was any excellent poet that invented good fables, or
made laudable verses, which was not in love himself;</q> had he not taken a
quill from Cupid's wings, he could never have written so amorously as he
did.

Petrarch's Laura made him so famous, Astrophel's Stella, and Jovianus

Charis, crocum, Laurus, unguentem, costum, lachrymae, myrrha, musae</span>, &amp;c. and
the rest of his poems; why are Italians at this day generally so good poets
and painters? Because every man of any fashion amongst them hath his
mistress. The very rustics and hog-rubbers, Menalcas and Corydon, <span lang="la">qui

this love-liquor, are inspired in an instant. Instead of those accurate
emblems, curious impresses, gaudy masques, tilts, tournaments, &amp;c., they
have their wakes, Whitsun-ales, shepherd's feasts, meetings on holidays,
country dances, roundelays, writing their names on <a href="#note5545">[5545]</a>trees, true

Your most grim stoics and severe philosophers will melt away with this
passion, and if <a href="#note5547">[5547]</a>Atheneus belie them not, Aristippus, Apollodorus,
Antiphanes, &amp;c., have made love-songs and commentaries of their mistress'
praises, <a href="#note5548">[5548]</a>orators write epistles, princes give titles, honours, what
not? <a href="#note5549">[5549]</a>Xerxes gave to Themistocles Lampsacus to find him wine,
Magnesia for bread, and Myunte for the rest of his diet. The <a href="#note5550">[5550]</a>Persian
kings allotted whole cities to like use, <span lang="la">haec civitas mulieri redimiculum
praebeat, haec in collum, haec in crines</span>, one whole city served to dress her
hair, another her neck, a third her hood. Ahasuerus would <a href="#note5551">[5551]</a>have given
Esther half his empire, and <a href="#note5552">[5552]</a>Herod bid Herodias <q>ask what she would,
she should have it.</q> Caligula gave 100,000 sesterces to his courtesan at
first word, to buy her pins, and yet when he was solicited by the senate to
bestow something to repair the decayed walls of Rome for the commonwealth's
good, he would give but 6000 sesterces at most. <a href="#note5553">[5553]</a>Dionysius, that
Sicilian tyrant, rejected all his privy councillors, and was so besotted on
Mirrha his favourite and mistress, that he would bestow no office, or in
the most weightiest business of the kingdom do aught without her especial
advice, prefer, depose, send, entertain no man, though worthy and well
deserving, but by her consent; and he again whom she commended, howsoever
unfit, unworthy, was as highly approved. Kings and emperors, instead of
poems, build cities; Adrian built Antinoa in Egypt, besides constellations,
temples, altars, statues, images, &amp;c., in the honour of his Antinous.
Alexander bestowed infinite sums to set out his Hephestion to all eternity.
<a href="#note5554">[5554]</a>Socrates professeth himself love's servant, ignorant in all arts and
sciences, a doctor alone in love matters, <span lang="la">et quum alienarum rerum omnium

very bloodhound of beauty, as he is styled by others. But I conclude there
is no end of love's symptoms, 'tis a bottomless pit. Love is subject to no
dimensions; not to be surveyed by any art or engine: and besides, I am of
<a href="#note5556">[5556]</a>Haedus' mind, <q>no man can discourse of love matters, or judge of them
aright, that hath not made trial in his own person,</q> or as Aeneas Sylvius
<a href="#note5557">[5557]</a>adds, <q>hath not a little doted, been mad or lovesick himself.</q> I
confess I am but a novice, a contemplator only, <span lang="la">Nescio quid sit amor nec

it, yet <span lang="la">homo sum</span>, &amp;c., not altogether inexpert in this subject, <span lang="la">non sum

<h4><i>Prognostics of Love-Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>What fires, torments, cares, jealousies, suspicions, fears, griefs,
anxieties, accompany such as are in love, I have sufficiently said: the
next question is, what will be the event of such miseries, what they
foretell. Some are of opinion that this love cannot be cured, <span lang="la">Nullis amor
est medicabilis herbis</span>, it accompanies them to the <a href="#note5559">[5559]</a>last, <span lang="la">Idem amor
exitio est pecori pecorisque magistro</span>. <q>The same passion consume both the
sheep and the shepherd,</q> and is so continuate, that by no persuasion almost
it may be relieved. <a href="#note5560">[5560]</a><q>Bid me not love,</q> said Euryalus, <q>bid the
mountains come down into the plains, bid the rivers run back to their
fountains; I can as soon leave to love, as the sun leave his course;</q>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5561">[5561]</a>Et prius aequoribus pisces, et montibus umbrae,</div>
<div class="line">Et volucres deerunt sylvis, et murmura ventis,</div>

</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">First seas shall want their fish, the mountains shade</div>
<div class="line">Woods singing birds, the wind's murmur shall fade,</div>
<div class="line">Than my fair Amaryllis' love allay'd.</div>
</div>
Bid me not love, bid a deaf man hear, a blind man see, a dumb speak, lame
run, counsel can do no good, a sick man cannot relish, no physic can ease
me. <span lang="la">Non prosunt domino quae prosunt omnibus artes</span>. As Apollo confessed,
and Jupiter himself could not be cured.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

<div class="line">Physic can soon cure every disease,</div>
<div class="line"><a href="#note5563">[5563]</a>Excepting love that can it not appease.</div>
</div>
But whether love may be cured or no, and by what means, shall be explained
in his place; in the meantime, if it take his course, and be not otherwise
eased or amended, it breaks out into outrageous often and prodigious
events. <span lang="la">Amor et Liber violenti dii sunt</span>) as <a href="#note5564">[5564]</a>Tatius observes, <span lang="la">et
eousque animum incendunt, ut pudoris oblivisci cogant</span>, love and Bacchus
are so violent gods, so furiously rage in our minds, that they make us
forget all honesty, shame, and common civility. For such men ordinarily, as
are thoroughly possessed with this humour, become <span lang="la">insensati et insani</span>,
for it is <a href="#note5565">[5565]</a><span lang="la">amor insanus</span>, as the poet calls it, beside themselves,
and as I have proved, no better than beasts, irrational, stupid,
headstrong, void of fear of God or men, they frequently forswear
themselves, spend, steal, commit incests, rapes, adulteries, murders,
depopulate towns, cities, countries, to satisfy their lust.
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5566">[5566]</a>A devil 'tis, and mischief such doth work,</div>
<div class="line">As never yet did Pagan, Jew, or Turk.</div>
</div>
The wars of Troy may be a sufficient witness; and as Appian, <span class="cite">lib. 5.
hist</span>, saith of Antony and Cleopatra, <a href="#note5567">[5567]</a><q>Their love brought themselves
and all Egypt into extreme and miserable calamities,</q> <q>the end of her is as
bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword,</q> <span class="bibcite">Prov. v. 4, 5.</span>
<q>Her feet go down to death, her steps lead on to hell. She is more bitter
than death,</q> (<span class="bibcite">Eccles. vii. 28.</span>) <q>and the sinner shall be taken by her.</q>
<a href="#note5568">[5568]</a><span lang="la">Qui in amore praecipitavit, pejus perit, quam qui saxo salit</span>.
<a href="#note5569">[5569]</a><q>He that runs headlong from the top of a rock is not in so bad a
case as he that falls into this gulf of love.</q> <q>For hence,</q> saith <a href="#note5570">[5570]</a>
Platina, <q>comes repentance, dotage, they lose themselves, their wits, and
make shipwreck of their fortunes altogether:</q> madness, to make away
themselves and others, violent death. <span lang="la">Prognosticatio est talis</span>, saith
Gordonius, <a href="#note5571">[5571]</a><span lang="la">si non succurratur iis, aut in maniam cadunt, aut
moriuntur</span>; the prognostication is, they will either run mad, or die. <q>For
if this passion continue,</q> saith <a href="#note5572">[5572]</a>Aelian Montaltus, <q>it makes the
blood hot, thick, and black; and if the inflammation get into the brain,
with continual meditation and waking, it so dries it up, that madness
follows, or else they make away themselves,</q> <a href="#note5573">[5573]</a><span lang="la">O Corydon, Corydon,
quae te dementia cepit</span>? Now, as Arnoldus adds, it will speedily work these
effects, if it be not presently helped; <a href="#note5574">[5574]</a><q>They will pine away, run
mad, and die upon a sudden;</q> <span lang="la">Facile incidunt in maniam</span>, saith Valescus,

Go to Bedlam for examples. It is so well known in every village, how many
have either died for love, or voluntary made away themselves, that I need
not much labour to prove it: <a href="#note5578">[5578]</a><span lang="la">Nec modus aut requies nisi mors

As soon as Euryalus departed from Senes, Lucretia, his paramour, <q>never
looked up, no jests could exhilarate her sad mind, no joys comfort her

But this is a gentle end, a natural death, such persons commonly make away

love of Policrita, Medea for the love of Jason, she taught him how to tame
the fire-breathing brass-feeted bulls, and kill the mighty dragon that kept
the golden fleece, and tore her little brother Absyrtus in pieces, that her
father. Aethes might have something to detain him, while she ran away with
her beloved Jason, &amp;c. Such acts and scenes hath this tragicomedy of love.

<h4><a name="3.2.5.1"></a>SUBSECT. 1.&mdash;<i>Cure of Love-Melancholy, by Labour, Diet, Physic, Fasting, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Although it be controverted by some, whether love-melancholy may be cured,
because it is so irresistible and violent a passion; for as you know,

Yet without question, if it be taken in time, it may be helped, and by many
good remedies amended. Avicenna, <span class="cite">lib. 3. Fen. cap. 23. et 24.</span> sets
down seven compendious ways how this malady may be eased, altered, and
expelled. Savanarola 9. principal observations, Jason Pratensis prescribes

main precepts, Arnoldus, Valleriola, Montaltus, Hildesheim, Langius, and
others inform us otherwise, and yet all tending to, the same purpose. The
sum of which I will briefly epitomise, (for I light my candle from their
torches) and enlarge again upon occasion, as shall seem best to me, and
that after mine own method. The first rule to be observed in this stubborn
and unbridled passion, is exercise and diet. It is an old and well-known,
sentence, <span lang="la">Sine Cerere et Saccho friget Venus</span> (love grows cool without
bread and wine). As an <a href="#note5602">[5602]</a>idle sedentary life, liberal feeding, are
great causes of it, so the opposite, labour, slender and sparing diet, with
continual business, are the best and most ordinary means to prevent it.

<span lang="la">Non habet unde suum paupertas pascat amorem</span>. <a href="#note5610">[5610]</a>Guianerius therefore
prescribes his patient <q>to go with hair-cloth next his skin, to go
barefooted, and barelegged in cold weather, to whip himself now and then,
as monks do, but above all to fast.</q> Not with sweet wine, mutton and
pottage, as many of those tender-bellies do, howsoever they put on Lenten
faces, and whatsoever they pretend, but from all manner of meat. Fasting is
an all-sufficient remedy of itself; for, as Jason Pratensis holds, the
bodies of such persons that feed liberally, and live at ease, <a href="#note5611">[5611]</a><q>are
full of bad spirits and devils, devilish thoughts; no better physic for
such parties, than to fast.</q> Hildesheim, <span class="cite">spicel. 2.</span> to this of hunger,
adds, <a href="#note5612">[5612]</a><q>often baths, much exercise and sweat,</q> but hunger and fasting
he prescribes before the rest. And 'tis indeed our Saviour's oracle, <q>This
kind of devil is not cast out but by fasting and prayer,</q> which makes the
fathers so immoderate in commendation of fasting. As <q>hunger,</q> saith <a href="#note5613">[5613]</a>
Ambrose, <q>is a friend of virginity, so is it an enemy to lasciviousness,
but fullness overthrows chastity, and fostereth all manner of provocations.</q>
If thine horse be too lusty, Hierome adviseth thee to take away some of his
provender; by this means those Pauls, Hilaries, Anthonies, and famous
anchorites, subdued the lusts of the flesh; by this means Hilarion <q>made
his ass, as he called his own body, leave kicking,</q> (so <a href="#note5614">[5614]</a>Hierome
relates of him in his life) <q>when the devil tempted him to any such foul
offence.</q> By this means those <a href="#note5615">[5615]</a>Indian Brahmins kept themselves
continent: they lay upon the ground covered with skins, as the red-shanks
do on heather, and dieted themselves sparingly on one dish, which
Guianerius would have all young men put in practice, and if that will not
serve, <a href="#note5616">[5616]</a>Gordonius <q>would have them soundly whipped, or, to cool their
courage, kept in prison,</q> and there fed with bread and water till they
acknowledge their error, and become of another mind. If imprisonment and
hunger will not take them down, according to the directions of that <a href="#note5617">[5617]</a>
Theban Crates, <q>time must wear it out; if time will not, the last refuge is
a halter.</q> But this, you will say, is comically spoken. Howsoever, fasting,
by all means, must be still used; and as they must refrain from such meats
formerly mentioned, which cause venery, or provoke lust, so they must use
an opposite diet. <a href="#note5618">[5618]</a>Wine must be altogether avoided of the younger
sort. So <a href="#note5619">[5619]</a>Plato prescribes, and would have the magistrates themselves
abstain from it, for example's sake, highly commending the Carthaginians
for their temperance in this kind. And 'twas a good edict, a commendable
thing, so that it were not done for some sinister respect, as those old
Egyptians abstained from wine, because some fabulous poets had given out,
wine sprang first from the blood of the giants, or out of superstition, as
our modern Turks, but for temperance, it being <span lang="la">animae virus et vitiorum
fomes</span>, a plague itself, if immoderately taken. Women of old for that
cause, <a href="#note5620">[5620]</a>in hot countries, were forbid the use of it; as severely
punished for drinking of wine as for adultery; and young folks, as Leonicus
hath recorded, Var. <span class="cite">hist. l. 3. cap. 87, 88.</span> out of Athenaeus and others,
and is still practised in Italy, and some other countries of Europe and
Asia, as Claudius Minoes hath well illustrated in his Comment on the 23.
Emblem of Alciat. So choice is to be made of other diet.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Nec minus erucas aptum est vitare salaces,</div>
<div class="line">Et quicquid veneri corpora nostra parat.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Eringos are not good for to be taken,</div>
<div class="line">And all lascivious meats must be forsaken.</div>
</div>
Those opposite meats which ought to be used are cucumbers, melons,
purslane, water-lilies, rue, woodbine, ammi, lettuce, which Lemnius so much
commends, <span class="cite">lib. 2, cap. 42.</span> and Mizaldus <span class="cite">hort. med.</span> to this purpose;
vitex, or agnus castus before the rest, which, saith <a href="#note5621">[5621]</a>Magninus, hath
a wonderful virtue in it. Those Athenian women, in their solemn feasts
called Thesmopheries, were to abstain nine days from the company of men,
during which time, saith Aelian, they laid a certain herb, named hanea, in
their beds, which assuaged those ardent flames of love, and freed them from
the torments of that violent passion. See more in Porta, Matthiolus,
Crescentius <span class="cite">lib. 5.</span> &amp;c., and what every herbalist almost and physician
hath written, <span class="cite">cap. de Satyriasi et Priapismo</span>; Rhasis amongst the rest. In
some cases again, if they be much dejected, and brought low in body, and
now ready to despair through anguish, grief, and too sensible a feeling of
their misery, a cup of wine and full diet is not amiss, and as Valescus
adviseth, <span lang="la">cum alia honesta venerem saepe exercendo</span>, which Langius <span class="cite">epist.
med. lib. 1. epist. 24.</span> approves out of Rhasis (<span lang="la">ad assiduationem coitus
invitat</span>] and Guianerius seconds it, <span class="cite">cap. 16. tract. 16.</span> as a <a href="#note5622">[5622]</a>
very profitable remedy.

</div>
<a href="#note5624">[5624]</a>Jason Pratensis subscribes to this counsel of the poet, <span lang="la">Excretio
enim aut tollet prorsus aut lenit aegritudinem.</span> As it did the raging lust
of Ahasuerus, <a href="#note5625">[5625]</a><span lang="la">qui ad impatientiam amoris leniendam, per singulas
fere noctes novas puellas devirginavit.</span> And to be drunk too by fits; but
this is mad physic, if it be at all to be permitted. If not, yet some
pleasure is to be allowed, as that which Vives speaks of, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de
anima.</span>, <a href="#note5626">[5626]</a><q>A lover that hath as it were lost himself through
impotency, impatience, must be called home as a traveller, by music,
feasting, good wine, if need be to drunkenness itself, which many so much
commend for the easing of the mind, all kinds of sports and merriments, to
see fair pictures, hangings, buildings, pleasant fields, orchards, gardens,
groves, ponds, pools, rivers, fishing, fowling, hawking, hunting, to hear
merry tales, and pleasant discourse, reading, to use exercise till he
sweat, that new spirits may succeed, or by some vehement affection or
contrary passion to be diverted till he be fully weaned from anger,
suspicion, cares, fears, &amp;c., and habituated into another course.</q> <span lang="la">Semper
tecum sit</span>, (as <a href="#note5627">[5627]</a>Sempronius adviseth Calisto his lovesick master)
<span lang="la">qui sermones joculares moveat, conciones ridiculas, dicteria falsa, suaves
historias, fabulas venustas recenseat, coram ludat</span>, &amp;c., still have a
pleasant companion to sing and tell merry tales, songs and facete
histories, sweet discourse, &amp;c. And as the melody of music, merriment,
singing, dancing, doth augment the passion of some lovers, as <a href="#note5628">[5628]</a>
Avicenna notes, so it expelleth it in others, and doth very much good.
These things must be warily applied, as the parties' symptoms vary, and as
they shall stand variously affected.

<p>If there be any need of physic, that the humours be altered, or any new
matter aggregated, they must be cured as melancholy men. Carolus a Lorme,
amongst other questions discussed for his degree at Montpelier in France,
hath this, <span lang="la">An amantes et amantes iisdem remediis curentur</span>? Whether lovers
and madmen be cured by the same remedies? he affirms it; for love extended
is mere madness. Such physic then as is prescribed, is either inward or
outward, as hath been formerly handled in the precedent partition in the
cure of melancholy. Consult with Valleriola <span class="cite">observat. lib. 2. observ.
7.</span> Lod. Mercatus <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 4. de mulier. affect.</span> Daniel Sennertus
<span class="cite">lib. 1. part. 2. cap. 10.</span> <a href="#note5629">[5629]</a>Jacobus Ferrandus the Frenchman, in
his Tract <span class="cite">de amore Erotique</span>, Forestus <span class="cite">lib. 10. observ. 29 and 30</span>,
Jason Pratensis and others for peculiar receipts. <a href="#note5630">[5630]</a>Amatus Lusitanus
cured a young Jew, that was almost mad for love, with the syrup of
hellebore, and such other evacuations and purges which are usually
prescribed to black choler: <a href="#note5631">[5631]</a>Avicenna confirms as much if need
require, and <a href="#note5632">[5632]</a><q>bloodletting above the rest,</q> which makes <span lang="la">amantes ne
sint amentes</span>, lovers to come to themselves, and keep in their right minds.
'Tis the same which Schola Salernitana, Jason Pratensis, Hildesheim, &amp;c.,
prescribe bloodletting to be used as a principal remedy. Those old
Scythians had a trick to cure all appetite of burning lust, by <a href="#note5633">[5633]</a>
letting themselves blood under the ears, and to make both men and women
barren, as Sabellicus in his <span class="cite">Aeneades</span> relates of them. Which Salmuth. <span class="cite">Tit.

amongst the Indians, a reason of which Langius gives <span class="cite">lib. 1. epist. 10.</span>

light upon a woman that hath good behaviour joined with her excellent
person, and shall perceive his eyes with a kind of greediness to pull unto
them this image of beauty, and carry it to the heart: shall observe himself
to be somewhat incensed with this influence, which moveth within: when he
shall discern those subtle spirits sparkling in her eyes, to administer
more fuel to the fire, he must wisely withstand the beginnings, rouse up
reason, stupefied almost, fortify his heart by all means, and shut up all
those passages, by which it may have entrance.</q> 'Tis a precept which all
concur upon,

Which cannot speedier be done, than if he confess his grief and passion to
some judicious friend <a href="#note5637">[5637]</a>(<span lang="la">qui tacitus ardet magis uritur</span>, the more he
conceals, the greater is his pain) that by his good advice may happily ease

persons, circumstance, amorous book or tale that may administer any
occasion of remembrance. <a href="#note5643">[5643]</a>Prosper adviseth young men not to read the

enlargeth itself by sight: but as Hierome to Nepotian, <span lang="la">aut aequaliter ama,

league with thine eyes, as <a href="#note5646">[5646]</a>Job did, and that is the safest course,
let all alone, see none of them. Nothing sooner revives, <a href="#note5647">[5647]</a><q>or waxeth
sore again,</q> as Petrarch holds, <q>than love doth by sight.</q> <q>As pomp renews
ambition; the sight of gold, covetousness; a beauteous object sets on fire
this burning lust.</q> <span lang="la">Et multum saliens incitat unda sitim.</span> The sight of
drink makes one dry, and the sight of meat increaseth appetite. 'Tis
dangerous therefore to see. A <a href="#note5648">[5648]</a>young gentleman in merriment would
needs put on his mistress's clothes, and walk abroad alone, which some of
her suitors espying, stole him away for her that he represented. So much
can sight enforce. Especially if he have been formerly enamoured, the sight
of his mistress strikes him into a new fit, and makes him rave many days
after.

broken, dry wood quickly kindles, and when they have been formerly wounded
with sight, how can they by seeing but be inflamed? Ismenias acknowledged
as much of himself, when he had been long absent, and almost forgotten his
mistress, <a href="#note5651">[5651]</a><q>at the first sight of her, as straw in a fire, I burned
afresh, and more than ever I did before.</q> <a href="#note5652">[5652]</a><q>Chariclia was as much

stranger.</q> <a href="#note5653">[5653]</a>Mertila, in Aristaenetus, swore she would never love
Pamphilus again, and did moderate her passion, so long as he was absent;
but the next time he came in presence, she could not contain, <span lang="la">effuse

embrace him. Hermotinus, a young man (in the said <a href="#note5654">[5654]</a>author) is all out
as unstaid, he had forgot his mistress quite, and by his friends was well
weaned from her love; but seeing her by chance, <span lang="la">agnovit veteris vestigia
flammae</span>, he raved amain, <span lang="la">Illa tamen emergens veluti lucida stella cepit

And it is the common passion of all lovers to be overcome in this sort. For

comes by seeing, <a href="#note5655">[5655]</a><q>when he heard Darius's wife so much commended for
her beauty, would scarce admit her to come in his sight,</q> foreknowing
belike that of Plutarch, <span lang="la">formosam videre periculosissimum</span>, how full of
danger it is to see a proper woman, and though he was intemperate in other
things, yet in this <span lang="la">superbe se gessit</span>, he carried himself bravely. And so
when as Araspus, in Xenophon, had so much magnified that divine face of
Panthea to Cyrus, <a href="#note5656">[5656]</a><q>by how much she was fairer than ordinary, by so
much he was the more unwilling to see her.</q> Scipio, a young man of
twenty-three years of age, and the most beautiful of the Romans, equal in
person to that Grecian Charinus, or Homer's Nireus, at the siege of a city
in Spain, when as a noble and most fair young gentlewoman was brought unto
him, <a href="#note5657">[5657]</a><q>and he had heard she was betrothed to a lord, rewarded her,
and sent her back to her sweetheart.</q> St. Austin, as <a href="#note5658">[5658]</a>Gregory reports
of him, <span lang="la">ne cum sorore quidem sua putavit habitandum</span>, would not live in
the house with his own sister. Xenocrates lay with Lais of Corinth all
night, and would not touch her. Socrates, though all the city of Athens
supposed him to dote upon fair Alcibiades, yet when he had an opportunity,
<a href="#note5659">[5659]</a><span lang="la">solus cum solo</span> to lie in the chamber with, and was wooed by him
besides, as the said Alcibiades publicly <a href="#note5660">[5660]</a>confessed, <span lang="la">formam sprevit
et superbe contempsit</span>, he scornfully rejected him. Petrarch, that had so
magnified his Laura in several poems, when by the pope's means she was
offered unto him, would not accept of her. <a href="#note5661">[5661]</a><q>It is a good happiness
to be free from this passion of love, and great discretion it argues in
such a man that he can so contain himself; but when thou art once in love,
to moderate thyself (as he saith) is a singular point of wisdom.</q>

For this purpose, saith <a href="#note5668">[5668]</a>Propertius, my parents sent me to Athens;
time and patience wear away pain and grief, as fire goes out for want of
fuel. <span lang="la">Quantum oculis, animo tam procul ibit amor</span>. But so as they tarry
out long enough: a whole year <a href="#note5669">[5669]</a>Xenophon prescribes <span lang="la">Critobulus, vix
enim intra hoc tempus ab amore sanari poteris</span>: some will hardly be weaned
under. All this <a href="#note5670">[5670]</a>Heinsius merrily inculcates in an epistle to his
friend Primierus; first fast, then tarry, thirdly, change thy place,
fourthly, think of a halter. If change of place, continuance of time,
absence, will not wear it out with those precedent remedies, it will hardly
be removed: but these commonly are of force. Felix Plater, <span class="cite">observ. lib.
1.</span> had a baker to his patient, almost mad for the love of his maid, and
desperate; by removing her from him, he was in a short space cured. Isaeus,
a philosopher of Assyria, was a most dissolute liver in his youth, <span lang="la">palam
lasciviens</span>, in love with all he met; but after he betook himself, by his
friends' advice, to his study, and left women's company, he was so changed
that he cared no more for plays, nor feasts, nor masks, nor songs, nor
verses, fine clothes, nor no such love toys: he became a new man upon a
sudden, <span lang="la">tanquam si priores oculos amisisset</span>, (saith mine <a href="#note5671">[5671]</a>author)
as if he had lost his former eyes. Peter Godefridus, in the last chapter of
his third book, hath a story out of St. Ambrose, of a young man that
meeting his old love after long absence, on whom he had extremely doted,
would scarce take notice of her; she wondered at it, that he should so
lightly esteem her, called him again, <span lang="la">lenibat dictis animum</span>, and told him
who she was, <span lang="la">Ego sum, inquit: At ego non sum ego</span>; but he replied, <q>he was
not the same man:</q> <span lang="la">proripuit sese tandem</span>, as <a href="#note5672">[5672]</a>Aeneas fled from Dido,
not vouchsafing her any farther parley, loathing his folly, and ashamed of
that which formerly he had done. <a href="#note5673">[5673]</a><span lang="la">Non sum stultus ut ante jam
Neaera</span>. <q>O Neaera, put your tricks, and practise hereafter upon somebody
else, you shall befool me no longer.</q> Petrarch hath such another tale of a
young gallant, that loved a wench with one eye, and for that cause by his
parents was sent to travel into far countries, <q>after some years he
returned, and meeting the maid for whose sake he was sent abroad, asked her
how, and by what chance she lost her eye? no, said she, I have lost none,
but you have found yours:</q> signifying thereby, that all lovers were blind,
as Fabius saith, <span lang="la">Amantes de forma judicare non possunt</span>, lovers cannot
judge of beauty, nor scarce of anything else, as they will easily confess
after they return unto themselves, by some discontinuance or better advice,
wonder at their own folly, madness, stupidity, blindness, be much abashed,
<q>and laugh at love, and call it an idle thing, condemn themselves that ever
they should be so besotted or misled: and be heartily glad they have so
happily escaped.</q>

<p>If so be (which is seldom) that change of place will not effect this
alteration, then other remedies are to be annexed, fair and foul means, as
to persuade, promise, threaten, terrify, or to divert by some contrary
passion, rumour, tales, news, or some witty invention to alter his
affection, <a href="#note5674">[5674]</a><q>by some greater sorrow to drive out the less,</q> saith
Gordonius, as that his house is on fire, his best friends dead, his money
stolen. <a href="#note5675">[5675]</a><q>That he is made some great governor, or hath some honour,
office, some inheritance is befallen him.</q> He shall be a knight, a baron;
or by some false accusation, as they do to such as have the hiccup, to make
them forget it. St. Hierome, <span class="cite">lib. 2. epist. 16.</span> to Rusticus the monk,
hath an instance of a young man of Greece, that lived in a monastery in
Egypt, <a href="#note5676">[5676]</a><q>that by no labour, no continence, no persuasion, could be
diverted, but at last by this trick he was delivered. The abbot sets one of
his convent to quarrel with him, and with some scandalous reproach or other
to defame him before company, and then to come and complain first, the
witnesses were likewise suborned for the plaintiff. The young man wept, and
when all were against him, the abbot cunningly took his part, lest he
should be overcome with immoderate grief: but what need many words? by this
invention he was cured, and alienated from his pristine
love-thoughts</q>&mdash;Injuries, slanders, contempts, disgraces&mdash;<span lang="la">spretaeque
injuria formae</span>, <q>the insult of her slighted beauty,</q> are very forcible
means to withdraw men's affections, <span lang="la">contumelia affecti amatores amare
desinunt</span>, as <a href="#note5677">[5677]</a>Lucian saith, lovers reviled or neglected, contemned
or misused, turn love to hate; <a href="#note5678">[5678]</a><span lang="la">redeam? Non si me obsecret</span>, <q>I'll
never love thee more.</q> <span lang="la">Egone illam, quae illum, quae me, quae non</span>? So
Zephyrus hated Hyacinthus because he scorned him, and preferred his
co-rival Apollo (Palephaetus <span class="cite">fab. Nar.</span>), he will not come again though he
be invited. Tell him but how he was scoffed at behind his back, ('tis the
counsel of Avicenna), that his love is false, and entertains another,
rejects him, cares not for him, or that she is a fool; a nasty quean, a
slut, a vixen, a scold, a devil, or, which Italians commonly do, that he or
she hath some loathsome filthy disease, gout, stone, strangury, falling
sickness, and that they are hereditary, not to be avoided, he is subject to
a consumption, hath the pox, that he hath three or four incurable tetters,
issues; that she is bald, her breath stinks, she is mad by inheritance, and
so are all the kindred, a hair-brain, with many other secret infirmities,
which I will not so much as name, belonging to women. That he is a
hermaphrodite, an eunuch, imperfect, impotent, a spendthrift, a gamester, a
fool, a gull, a beggar, a whoremaster, far in debt, and not able to
maintain her, a common drunkard, his mother was a witch, his father hanged,
that he hath a wolf in his bosom, a sore leg, he is a leper, hath some
incurable disease, that he will surely beat her, he cannot hold his water,
that he cries out or walks in the night, will stab his bedfellow, tell all
his secrets in his sleep, and that nobody dare lie with him, his house is
haunted with spirits, with such fearful and tragical things, able to avert
and terrify any man or woman living, Gordonius, <span class="cite">cap. 20. part. 2.</span> hunc in

&amp;c. If you suspect to be taken, be sure, saith the poet, to have two
mistresses at once, or go from one to another: as he that goes from a good
fire in cold weather is both to depart from it, though in the next room
there be a better which will refresh him as much; there's as much
difference of <span lang="la">haec</span> as <span lang="la">hac ignis</span>; or bring him to some public shows,
plays, meetings, where he may see variety, and he shall likely loathe his
first choice: carry him but to the next town, yea peradventure to the next
house, and as Paris lost Oenone's love by seeing Helen, and Cressida
forsook Troilus by conversing with Diomede, he will dislike his former
mistress, and leave her quite behind him, as <a href="#note5684">[5684]</a>Theseus left Ariadne
fast asleep in the island of Dia, to seek her fortune, that was erst his
loving mistress. <a href="#note5685">[5685]</a><span lang="la">Nunc primum Dorida vetus amator contempsi</span>, as he
said, Doris is but a dowdy to this. As he that looks himself in a glass
forgets his physiognomy forthwith, this flattering glass of love will be
diminished by remove; after a little absence it will be remitted, the next
fair object will likely alter it. A young man in <a href="#note5686">[5686]</a>Lucian was
pitifully in love, he came to the theatre by chance, and by seeing other
fair objects there, <span lang="la">mentis sanitatem recepit</span>, was fully recovered, <a href="#note5687">[5687]</a>
<q>and went merrily home, as if he had taken a dram of oblivion.</q> <a href="#note5688">[5688]</a>A
mouse (saith an apologer) was brought up in a chest, there fed with
fragments of bread and cheese, though there could be no better meat, till
coming forth at last, and feeding liberally of other variety of viands,
loathed his former life: moralise this fable by thyself. Plato, in. his
seventh book <span class="cite">De Legibus</span>, hath a pretty fiction of a city under ground,
<a href="#note5689">[5689]</a>to which by little holes some small store of light came; the
inhabitants thought there could not be a better place, and at their first
coming abroad they might not endure the light, <span lang="la">aegerrime solem intueri</span>;
but after they were accustomed a little to it, <a href="#note5690">[5690]</a><q>they deplored their
fellows' misery that lived under ground.</q> A silly lover is in like state,
none so fair as his mistress at first, he cares for none but her; yet after
a while, when he hath compared her with others, he abhors her name, sight,
and memory. 'Tis generally true; for as he observes, <a href="#note5691">[5691]</a><span lang="la">Priorem
flammam novus ignis extrudit; et ea multorum natura, ut praesentes maxime
ament</span>, one fire drives out another; and such is women's weakness, that
they love commonly him that is present. And so do many men; as he
confessed, he loved Amye, till he saw Florial, and when he saw Cynthia,
forgat them both: but fair Phillis was incomparably beyond, them all,
Cloris surpassed her, and yet when he espied Amaryllis, she was his sole
mistress; O divine Amaryllis: <span lang="la">quam procera, cupressi ad instar, quam
elegans, quam decens</span>, &amp;c. How lovely, how tall, how comely she was (saith
Polemius) till he saw another, and then she was the sole subject of his
thoughts. In conclusion, her he loves best he saw last. <a href="#note5692">[5692]</a>Triton, the
sea-god, first loved Leucothoe, till he came in presence of Milaene, she was
the commandress of his heart, till he saw Galatea: but (as <a href="#note5693">[5693]</a>she
complains) he loved another eftsoons, another, and another. 'Tis a thing
which, by Hierom's report, hath been usually practised. <a href="#note5694">[5694]</a><q>Heathen
philosophers drive out one love with another, as they do a peg, or pin with
a pin. Which those seven Persian princes did to Ahasuerus, that they might
requite the desire of Queen Vashti with the love of others.</q> Pausanias in
Eliacis saith, that therefore one Cupid was painted to contend with
another, and to take the garland from him, because one love drives out
another, <a href="#note5695">[5695]</a><span lang="la">Alterius vires subtrahit alter amor</span>; and Tully, <span class="cite">3.
Nat. Deor.</span> disputing with C. Cotta, makes mention of three several Cupids,
all differing in office. Felix Plater, in the first book of his
observations, boasts how he cured a widower in Basil, a patient of his, by
this stratagem alone, that doted upon a poor servant his maid, when
friends, children, no persuasion could serve to alienate his mind: they
motioned him to another honest man's daughter in the town, whom he loved,
and lived with long after, abhorring the very name and sight of the first.
After the death of Lucretia, <a href="#note5696">[5696]</a>Euryalus would admit of no comfort,
till the Emperor Sigismund married him to a noble lady of his court, and so
in short space he was freed.

<h4><a name="3.2.5.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>By counsel and persuasion, foulness of the fact, men's, women's faults, miseries of marriage, events of lust, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>As there be divers causes of this burning lust, or heroical love, so there
be many good remedies to ease and help; amongst which, good counsel and
persuasion, which I should have handled in the first place, are of great
moment, and not to be omitted. Many are of opinion, that in this blind
headstrong passion counsel can do no good.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5697">[5697]</a>Quae enim res in se neque consilium neque modum</div>
<div class="line">Habet, ullo eam consilio regere non potes.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Which thing hath neither judgment, or an end,</div>
<div class="line">How should advice or counsel it amend?</div>
</div>
<a href="#note5698">[5698]</a><span lang="la">Quis enim modus adsit amori</span>? But, without question, good counsel
and advice must needs be of great force, especially if it shall proceed
from a wise, fatherly, reverent, discreet person, a man of authority, whom
the parties do respect, stand in awe of, or from a judicious friend, of
itself alone it is able to divert and suffice. Gordonius, the physician,
attributes so much to it, that he would have it by all means used in the
first place. <span lang="la">Amoveatur ab illa, consilio viri quem timet, ostendendo
pericula saeculi, judicium inferni, gaudia Paradisi</span>. He would have some
discreet men to dissuade them, after the fury of passion is a little spent,
or by absence allayed; for it is as intempestive at first, to give counsel,
as to comfort parents when their children are in that instant departed; to
no purpose to prescribe narcotics, cordials, nectarines, potions, Homer's
nepenthes, or Helen's bowl, &amp;c. <span lang="la">Non cessabit pectus tundere</span>, she will
lament and howl for a season: let passion have his course awhile, and then
he may proceed, by foreshowing the miserable events and dangers which will
surely happen, the pains of hell, joys of Paradise, and the like, which by
their preposterous courses they shall forfeit or incur; and 'tis a fit
method, a very good means; for what <a href="#note5699">[5699]</a>Seneca said of vice, I say of
love, <span lang="la">Sine magistro discitur, vix sine magistro deseritur</span>, 'tis learned
of itself, but <a href="#note5700">[5700]</a>hardly left without a tutor. 'Tis not amiss therefore
to have some such overseer, to expostulate and show them such absurdities,
inconveniences, imperfections, discontents, as usually follow; which their
blindness, fury, madness, cannot apply unto themselves, or will not
apprehend through weakness; and good for them to disclose themselves, to
give ear to friendly admonitions. <q>Tell me, sweetheart (saith Tryphena to a
lovesick Charmides in <a href="#note5701">[5701]</a>Lucian), what is it that troubles thee?
peradventure I can ease thy mind, and further thee in thy suit;</q> and so,
without question, she might, and so mayst thou, if the patient be capable
of good counsel, and will hear at least what may be said.

<p>If he love at all, she is either an honest woman or a whore. If dishonest,
let him read or inculcate to him that 5. of Solomon's Proverbs, Ecclus. 26.
Ambros. <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 4.</span> in his book of Abel and Cain, Philo Judeus <span class="cite">de
mercede mer</span>. Platina's <span class="cite">dial. in Amores</span>, Espencaeus, and those three books
of Pet. Haedus <span class="cite">de contem. amoribus</span>, Aeneas Sylvius' tart Epistle, which he
wrote to his friend Nicholas of Warthurge, which he calls <span lang="la">medelam illiciti
amoris</span> &amp;c. <a href="#note5702">[5702]</a><q>For what's a whore,</q> as he saith, <q>but a poller of
youth, a <a href="#note5703">[5703]</a>ruin of men, a destruction, a devourer of patrimonies, a
downfall of honour, fodder for the devil, the gate of death, and supplement
of hell?</q> <a href="#note5704">[5704]</a><span lang="la">Talis amor est laqueus animae</span>, &amp;c., a bitter honey, sweet
poison, delicate destruction, a voluntary mischief, <span lang="la">commixtum coenum,
sterquilinium</span>. And as <a href="#note5705">[5705]</a>Pet. Aretine's Lucretia, a notable quean,
confesseth: <q>Gluttony, anger, envy, pride, sacrilege, theft, slaughter,
were all born that day that a whore began her profession; for,</q> as she
follows it, <q>her pride is greater than a rich churl's, she is more envious
than the pox, as malicious as melancholy, as covetous as hell. If from the
beginning of the world any were <span lang="la">mala, pejor, pessima</span>, bad in the
superlative degree, 'tis a whore; how many have I undone, caused to be
wounded, slain! O Antonia, thou seest <a href="#note5706">[5706]</a>what I am without, but within,
God knows, a puddle of iniquity, a sink of sin, a pocky quean.</q> Let him now
that so dotes meditate on this; let him see the event and success of
others, Samson, Hercules, Holofernes, &amp;c. Those infinite mischiefs attend
it: if she be another man's wife he loves, 'tis abominable in the sight of
God and men; adultery is expressly forbidden in God's commandment, a mortal
sin, able to endanger his soul: if he be such a one that fears God, or have
any religion, he will eschew it, and abhor the loathsomeness of his own
fact. If he love an honest maid, 'tis to abuse or marry her; if to abuse,
'tis fornication, a foul fact (though some make light of it), and almost
equal to adultery itself. If to marry, let him seriously consider what he
takes in hand, look before ye leap, as the proverb is, or settle his
affections, and examine first the party, and condition of his estate and
hers, whether it be a fit match, for fortunes, years, parentage, and such
other circumstances, <span lang="la">an sit sitae Veneris</span>. Whether it be likely to
proceed: if not, let him wisely stave himself off at the first, curb in his
inordinate passion, and moderate his desire, by thinking of some other
subject, divert his cogitations. Or if it be not for his good, as Aeneas,
forewarned by Mercury in a dream, left Dido's love, and in all haste got
him to sea,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5707">[5707]</a>Mnestea, Surgestumque vocat fortemque Cloanthem,</div>
<div class="line">Classem aptent taciti jubet&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
and although she did oppose with vows, tears, prayers, and imprecation.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5708">[5708]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;nullis ille movetur</div>
<div class="line">Fletibus, aut illas voces tractabilis audit;</div>
</div>
Let thy Mercury-reason rule thee against all allurements, seeming delights,
pleasing inward or outward provocations. Thou mayst do this if thou wilt,
<span lang="la">pater non deperit filiam, nec frater sororem</span>, a father dotes not on his
own daughter, a brother on a sister; and why? because it is unnatural,
unlawful, unfit. If he be sickly, soft, deformed, let him think of his
deformities, vices, infirmities; if in debt, let him ruminate how to pay
his debts: if he be in any danger, let him seek to avoid it: if he have any
lawsuit, or other business, he may do well to let his love-matters alone
and follow it, labour in his vocation whatever it is. But if he cannot so
ease himself, yet let him wisely premeditate of both their estates; if they
be unequal in years, she young and he old, what an unfit match must it
needs be, an uneven yoke, how absurd and indecent a thing is it! as Lycinus
in <a href="#note5709">[5709]</a>Lucian told Timolaus, for an old bald crook-nosed knave to marry
a young wench; how odious a thing it is to see an old lecher! What should
a bald fellow do with a comb, a dumb doter with a pipe, a blind man with a
looking-glass, and thou with such a wife? How absurd it is for a young man
to marry an old wife for a piece of good. But put case she be equal in
years, birth, fortunes, and other qualities correspondent, he doth desire

respects? Her beauty belike, and comeliness of person, that is commonly the
main object, she is a most absolute form, in his eye at least, <span lang="la">Cui formam

is it an error in his judgment.

not so fair as she seems. <span lang="la">Quaedam videntur et non sunt</span>; compare her to

tell me how thou likest her. It may be not she, that is so fair, but her
coats, or put another in her clothes, and she will seem all out as fair; as
the <a href="#note5711">[5711]</a>poet then prescribes, separate her from her clothes: suppose
thou saw her in a base beggar's weed, or else dressed in some old hirsute
attires out of fashion, foul linen, coarse raiment, besmeared with soot,
colly, perfumed with opoponax, sagapenum, asafoetida, or some such filthy

weeping, chafing, &amp;c., rivelled and ill-favoured to behold. She many times

for all her costly tires she is bald, and though she seem so fair by dark,
by candlelight, or afar off at such a distance, as Callicratides observed

<p>Some are of opinion, that to see a woman naked is able of itself to alter
his affection; and it is worthy of consideration, saith <a href="#note5718">[5718]</a>Montaigne
the Frenchman in his Essays, that the skilfulest masters of amorous
dalliance, appoint for a remedy of venerous passions, a full survey of the
body; which the poet insinuates,

It is reported of Seleucus, king of Syria, that seeing his wife
Stratonice's bald pate, as she was undressing her by chance, he could never
affect her after. Remundus Lullius, the physician, spying an ulcer or
cancer in his mistress' breast, whom he so dearly loved, from that day
following abhorred the looks of her. Philip the French king, as
Neubrigensis, <span class="cite">lib. 4. cap. 24.</span> relates it, married the king of
Denmark's daughter, <a href="#note5720">[5720]</a><q>and after he had used her as a wife one night,
because her breath stunk, they say, or for some other secret fault, sent
her back again to her father.</q> Peter Mattheus, in the life of Lewis the
Eleventh, finds fault with our English <a href="#note5721">[5721]</a>chronicles, for writing how
Margaret the king of Scots' daughter, and wife to Louis the Eleventh,
French king, was <span lang="la">ob graveolentiam oris</span>, rejected by her husband. Many
such matches are made for by-respects, or some seemly comeliness, which
after honeymoon's past, turn to bitterness: for burning lust is but a

dislike and contempt.

<p>Yea, but you will infer, your mistress is complete, of a most absolute form

blade which hath a gilded scabbard, embroidered with gold and jewels? No,
but that which hath a good edge and point, well tempered metal, able to
resist.</q> This beauty is of the body alone, and what is that, but as <a href="#note5734">[5734]</a>
Gregory Nazianzen telleth us, <q>a mock of time and sickness?</q> or as
Boethius, <a href="#note5735">[5735]</a><q>as mutable as a flower, and 'tis not nature so makes us,

Let her be such a one throughout, as Lucian deciphers in his Imagines, as
Euphranor of old painted Venus, Aristaenetus describes Lais, another Helena,
Chariclea, Leucippe, Lucretia, Pandora; let her have a box of beauty to
repair herself still, such a one as Venus gave Phaon, when he carried her
over the ford; let her use all helps art and nature can yield; be like her,
and her, and whom thou wilt, or all these in one; a little sickness, a
fever, small-pox, wound, scar, loss of an eye, or limb, a violent passion,
a distemperature of heat or cold, mars all in an instant, disfigures all;
child-bearing, old age, that tyrant time will turn Venus to Erinnys; raging
time, care, rivels her upon a sudden; after she hath been married a small
while, and the black ox hath trodden on her toe, she will be so much
altered, and wax out of favour, thou wilt not know her. One grows to fat,
another too lean, &amp;c., modest Matilda, pretty pleasing Peg, sweet-singing
Susan, mincing merry Moll, dainty dancing Doll, neat Nancy, jolly Joan,
nimble Nell, kissing Kate, bouncing Bess, with black eyes, fair Phyllis,
with fine white hands, fiddling Frank, tall Tib, slender Sib, &amp;c., will
quickly lose their grace, grow fulsome, stale, sad, heavy, dull, sour, and
all at last out of fashion. <span lang="la">Ubi jam vultus argutia, suavis suavitatio,
blandus, risus</span>, &amp;c. Those fair sparkling eyes will look dull, her soft
coral lips will be pale, dry, cold, rough, and blue, her skin rugged, that
soft and tender superficies will be hard and harsh, her whole complexion
change in a moment, and as <a href="#note5741">[5741]</a>Matilda writ to King John.

<div class="line">Admir'd of old, to this by child-birth brought:</div>

<p>To conclude with Chrysostom, <a href="#note5743">[5743]</a><q>When thou seest a fair and beautiful
person, a brave Bonaroba, <span lang="la">a bella donna, quae salivam moveat, lepidam
puellam et quam tu facile ames</span>, a comely woman, having bright eyes, a
merry countenance, a shining lustre in her look, a pleasant grace, wringing
thy soul, and increasing thy concupiscence; bethink with thyself that it is
but earth thou lovest, a mere excrement, which so vexeth thee, which thou
so admirest, and thy raging soul will be at rest. Take her skin from her
face, and thou shalt see all loathsomeness under it, that beauty is a
superficial skin and bones, nerves, sinews: suppose her sick, now rivelled,
hoary-headed, hollow-cheeked, old; within she is full of filthy phlegm,
stinking, putrid, excremental stuff: snot and snivel in her nostrils,
spittle in her mouth, water in her eyes, what filth in her brains,</q> &amp;c. Or
take her at best, and look narrowly upon her in the light, stand near her,
nearer yet, thou shalt perceive almost as much, and love less, as <a href="#note5744">[5744]</a>
Cardan well writes, <span lang="la">minus amant qui acute vident</span>, though Scaliger deride
him for it: if he see her near, or look exactly at such a posture,
whosoever he is, according to the true rules of symmetry and proportion,
those I mean of Albertus Durer, Lomatius and Tasnier, examine him of her.
If he be <span lang="la">elegans formarum spectator</span> he shall find many faults in
physiognomy, and ill colour: if form, one side of the face likely bigger
than the other, or crooked nose, bad eyes, prominent veins, concavities
about the eyes, wrinkles, pimples, red streaks, freckles, hairs, warts,
neves, inequalities, roughness, scabredity, paleness, yellowness, and as
many colours as are in a turkeycock's neck, many indecorums in their other
parts; <span lang="la">est quod desideres, est quod amputes</span>, one leers, another frowns,
a third gapes, squints, &amp;c. And 'tis true that he saith, <a href="#note5745">[5745]</a><span lang="la">Diligenter
consideranti raro facies absoluta, et quae vitio caret</span>, seldom shall you
find an absolute face without fault, as I have often observed; not in the
face alone is this defect or disproportion to be found; but in all the
other parts, of body and mind; she is fair, indeed, but foolish; pretty,
comely, and decent, of a majestical presence, but peradventure, imperious,
dishonest, <span lang="la">acerba, iniqua</span>, self-willed: she is rich, but deformed; hath
a sweet face, but bad carriage, no bringing up, a rude and wanton flirt; a
neat body she hath, but it is a nasty quean otherwise, a very slut, of a
bad kind. As flowers in a garden have colour some, but no smell, others
have a fragrant smell, but are unseemly to the eye; one is unsavoury to the
taste as rue, as bitter as wormwood, and yet a most medicinal cordial
flower, most acceptable to the stomach; so are men and women; one is well
qualified, but of ill proportion, poor and base: a good eye she hath, but a
bad hand and foot, <span lang="la">foeda pedes et foeda manus</span>, a fine leg, bad teeth, a
vast body, &amp;c. Examine all parts of body and mind, I advise thee to inquire
of all. See her angry, merry, laugh, weep, hot, cold, sick, sullen,
dressed, undressed, in all attires, sites, gestures, passions, eat her
meals, &amp;c., and in some of these you will surely dislike. Yea, not her only
let him observe, but her parents how they carry themselves: for what
deformities, defects, encumbrances of body or mind be in them at such an
age, they will likely be subject to, be molested in like manner, they will
<span lang="la">patrizare</span> or <span lang="la">matrizare.</span> And withal let him take notice of her
companions, <span lang="la">in convictu</span> (as Quiverra prescribes), <span lang="la">et quibuscum
conversetur</span>, whom she converseth with. <span lang="la">Noscitur ex comite, qui non
cognoscitur ex se.</span> <a href="#note5746">[5746]</a>According to Thucydides, she is commonly the
best, <span lang="la">de quo minimus foras habetur sermo</span>, that is least talked of abroad.
For if she be a noted reveller, a gadder, a singer, a pranker or dancer,
than take heed of her. For what saith Theocritus?

Young men will do it when they come to it. Fauns and satyrs will certainly
play reaks, when they come in such wanton Baccho's or Elenora's presence. Now
when they shall perceive any such obliquity, indecency, disproportion,
deformity, bad conditions, &amp;c., let them still ruminate on that, and as
<a href="#note5748">[5748]</a>Haedus adviseth out of Ovid, <span lang="la">earum mendas notent</span>, note their
faults, vices, errors, and think of their imperfections; 'tis the next way
to divert and mitigate love's furious headstrong passions; as a peacock's
feet, and filthy comb, they say, make him forget his fine feathers, and
pride of his tail; she is lovely, fair, well-favoured, well qualified,
courteous and kind, <q>but if she be not so to me, what care I how kind she
be?</q> I say with <a href="#note5749">[5749]</a>Philostratus, <span lang="la">formosa aliis, mihi superba</span>, she is
a tyrant to me, and so let her go. Besides these outward neves or open
faults, errors, there be many inward infirmities, secret, some private
(which I will omit), and some more common to the sex, sullen fits, evil
qualities, filthy diseases, in this case fit to be considered; <span class="prudish">consideratio

him passant: now when the fellow came for his piece, he was very angry, and
said, it was quite opposite to his mind; but Passus instantly turned the
picture upside down, showed him the horse at that site which he requested,
and so gave him satisfaction. If any man take exception at my words, let
him alter the name, read him for her, and 'tis all one in effect.

<p>But to my purpose: If women in general be so bad (and men worse than they)
what a hazard is it to marry? where shall a man find a good wife, or a
woman a good husband? A woman a man may eschew, but not a wife: wedding is
undoing (some say) marrying marring, wooing woeing: <a href="#note5759">[5759]</a><q>a wife is a
fever hectic,</q> as Scaliger calls her, <q>and not be cured but by death,</q> as

downright; I never tried, but as I hear some of them say, <a href="#note5762">[5762]</a><span lang="la">Mare haud

Which made the devil belike, as most interpreters hold, when he had taken
away Job's goods, <span lang="la">corporis et fortunae bona</span>, health, children, friends, to
persecute him the more, leave his wicked wife, as Pineda proves out of
Tertullian, Cyprian, Austin, Chrysostom, Prosper, Gaudentius, &amp;c. <span lang="la">ut novum

<span class="cite">Ter. And. 1. 5.</span> And yet for all this we bachelors desire to be married;
with that vestal virgin, we long for it, <a href="#note5764">[5764]</a><span lang="la">Felices nuptae! moriar,

Heigh-ho for a husband, cries she, a bad husband, nay, the worst that ever
was is better than none: O blissful marriage, O most welcome marriage, and
happy are they that are so coupled: we do earnestly seek it, and are never
well till we have effected it. But with what fate? like those birds in the
<a href="#note5765">[5765]</a>Emblem, that fed about a cage, so long as they could fly away at
their pleasure liked well of it; but when they were taken and might not get
loose, though they had the same meat, pined away for sullenness, and would
not eat. So we commend marriage,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;donec miselli liberi</div>
<div class="line">Aspichmis dominam; sed postquam heu janua clausa est,</div>
<div class="line">Fel intus est quod mel fuit:</div>
</div>
<q>So long as we are wooers, may kiss and coll at our pleasure, nothing is so
sweet, we are in heaven as we think; but when we are once tied, and have
lost our liberty, marriage is an hell,</q> <q>give me my yellow hose again:</q> a
mouse in a trap lives as merrily, we are in a purgatory some of us, if not
hell itself. <span lang="la">Dulce bellum inexpertis</span>, as the proverb is, 'tis fine
talking of war, and marriage sweet in contemplation, till it be tried: and
then as wars are most dangerous, irksome, every minute at death's door, so
is, &amp;c. When those wild Irish peers, saith <a href="#note5766">[5766]</a>Stanihurst, were feasted
by king Henry the Second, (at what time he kept his Christmas at Dublin)
and had tasted of his prince-like cheer, generous wines, dainty fare, had
seen his <a href="#note5767">[5767]</a>massy plate of silver, gold, enamelled, beset with jewels,
golden candlesticks, goodly rich hangings, brave furniture, heard his
trumpets sound, fifes, drums, and his exquisite music in all kinds: when
they had observed his majestical presence as he sat in purple robes,
crowned, with his sceptre, &amp;c., in his royal seat, the poor men were so
amazed, enamoured, and taken with the object, that they were <span lang="la">pertaesi
domestici et pristini tyrotarchi</span>, as weary and ashamed of their own
sordidity and manner of life. They would all be English forthwith; who but
English! but when they had now submitted themselves, and lost their former
liberty, they began to rebel some of them, others repent of what they had
done, when it was too late. 'Tis so with us bachelors, when we see and
behold those sweet faces, those gaudy shows that women make, observe their
pleasant gestures and graces, give ear to their siren tunes, see them
dance, &amp;c., we think their conditions are as fine as their faces, we are
taken, with dumb signs, <span lang="la">in amplexum ruimus</span>, we rave, we burn, and would
fain be married. But when we feel the miseries, cares, woes, that accompany
it, we make our moan many of us, cry out at length and cannot be released.
If this be true now, as some out of experience will inform us, farewell
wiving for my part, and as the comical poet merrily saith,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5768">[5768]</a>Perdatur ille pessime qui foeminam</div>

<div class="line">The first I wish no harm, poor man alas!</div>

</div>
What shall I say to him that marries again and again, <a href="#note5770">[5770]</a><span lang="la">Stulta
maritali qui porrigit ora capistro</span>, I pity him not, for the first time he
must do as he may, bear it out sometimes by the head and shoulders, and let
his next neighbour ride, or else run away, or as that Syracusian in a
tempest, when all ponderous things were to be exonerated out of the ship,
<span lang="la">quia maximum pondus erat</span>, fling his wife into the sea. But this I confess
is comically spoken, <a href="#note5771">[5771]</a>and so I pray you take it. In sober sadness,
<a href="#note5772">[5772]</a>marriage is a bondage, a thraldom, a yoke, a hindrance to all good
enterprises, (<q>he hath married a wife and cannot come</q>) a stop to all
preferments, a rock on which many are saved, many impinge and are cast
away: not that the thing is evil in itself or troublesome, but full of all
contentment and happiness, one of the three things which please God, <a href="#note5773">[5773]</a>
<q>when a man and his wife agree together,</q> an honourable and happy estate,
who knows it not? If they be sober, wise, honest, as the poet infers,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5774">[5774]</a>Si commodos nanciscantur amores,</div>
<div class="line">Nullum iis abest voluptatis genus.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">If fitly match'd be man and wife,</div>
<div class="line">No pleasure's wanting to their life.</div>
</div>
But to undiscreet sensual persons, that as brutes are wholly led by sense,
it is a feral plague, many times a hell itself, and can give little or no
content, being that they are often so irregular and prodigious in their
lusts, so diverse in their affections. <span lang="la">Uxor nomen dignitatis, non
voluptatis</span>, as <a href="#note5775">[5775]</a>he said, a wife is a name of honour, not of
pleasure: she is fit to bear the office, govern a family, to bring up
children, sit at a board's end and carve, as some carnal men think and say;
they had rather go to the stews, or have now and then a snatch as they can
come by it, borrow of their neighbours, than have wives of their own;
except they may, as some princes and great men do, keep as many courtesans
as they will themselves, fly out <span lang="la">impune</span>, <a href="#note5776">[5776]</a><span lang="la">Permolere uxores
alienas</span>, that polygamy of Turks, Lex Julia, with Caesar once enforced in
Rome, (though Levinus Torrentius and others suspect it) <span lang="la">uti uxores quot et
quas vellent liceret</span>, that every great man might marry, and keep as many
wives as he would, or Irish divorcement were in use: but as it is, 'tis
hard and gives not that satisfaction to these carnal men, beastly men as
too many are: <a href="#note5777">[5777]</a>What still the same, to be tied <a href="#note5778">[5778]</a>to one, be she
never so fair, never so virtuous, is a thing they may not endure, to love
one long. Say thy pleasure, and counterfeit as thou wilt, as <a href="#note5779">[5779]</a>Parmeno
told Thais, <span lang="la">Neque tu uno eris contenta</span>, <q>one man will never please thee;</q>
nor one woman many men. But as <a href="#note5780">[5780]</a>Pan replied to his father Mercury,
when he asked whether he was married, <span lang="la">Nequaquam pater, amator enim sum</span>
&amp;c. <q>No, father, no, I am a lover still, and cannot be contented with one
woman.</q> Pythias, Echo, Menades, and I know not how many besides, were his
mistresses, he might not abide marriage. <span lang="la">Varietas delectat</span>, 'tis
loathsome and tedious, what one still? which the satirist said of Iberina,
is verified in most,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5781">[5781]</a>Unus Iberinae vir sufficit? ocyus illud</div>
<div class="line">Extorquebis ut haec oculo contenta sit uno.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">'Tis not one man will serve her by her will,</div>
<div class="line">As soon she'll have one eye as one man still.</div>
</div>
As capable of any impression as <span lang="la">materia prima</span> itself, that still desires
new forms, like the sea their affections ebb and flow. Husband is a cloak
for some to hide their villainy; once married she may fly out at her
pleasure, the name of husband is a sanctuary to make all good. <span lang="la">Eo ventum</span>
(saith Seneca) <span lang="la">ut nulla virum habeat, nisi ut irritet adulterum</span>. They are
right and straight, as true Trojans as mine host's daughter, that Spanish
wench in <a href="#note5782">[5782]</a>Ariosto, as good wives as Messalina. Many men are as
constant in their choice, and as good husbands as Nero himself, they must
have their pleasure of all they see, and are in a word far more fickle than
any woman.
<div class="blackletter">
<div class="line">For either they be full of jealousy,</div>
<div class="line">Or masterfull, or loven novelty.</div>
</div>
Good men have often ill wives, as bad as Xanthippe was to Socrates, Elevora
to St. Lewis, Isabella to our Edward the Second; and good wives are as
often matched to ill husbands, as Mariamne to Herod, Serena to Diocletian,
Theodora to Theophilus, and Thyra to Gurmunde. But I will say nothing of
dissolute and bad husbands, of bachelors and their vices; their good
qualities are a fitter subject for a just volume, too well known already in
every village, town and city, they need no blazon; and lest I should mar
any matches, or dishearten loving maids, for this present I will let them
pass.

<p>Being that men and women are so irreligious, depraved by nature, so
wandering in their affections, so brutish, so subject to disagreement, so
unobservant of marriage rites, what shall I say? If thou beest such a one,
or thou light on such a wife, what concord can there be, what hope of
agreement? 'tis not <span lang="la">conjugium</span> but <span lang="la">conjurgium</span>, as the Reed and Fern in
the <a href="#note5783">[5783]</a>Emblem, averse and opposite in nature: 'tis twenty to one thou
wilt not marry to thy contentment: but as in a lottery forty blanks were
drawn commonly for one prize, out of a multitude you shall hardly choose a
good one: a small ease hence then, little comfort,

much better to have been childless. 'Tis too common in the middle sort; thy
son's a drunkard, a gamester, a spendthrift; thy daughter a fool, a whore;

thee weary of thy life. <a href="#note5791">[5791]</a><q>If thy wife be froward, when she may not

better have a block, she will shame thee and reveal thy secrets; if wise
and learned, well qualified, there is as much danger on the other side,

insolent and peevish, <a href="#note5792">[5792]</a><span lang="la">Malo Venusinam quam te Cornelia mater</span>. Take

Cromerus <span class="cite">lib. 12. hist.</span>, relates of Casimirus,<a href="#note5795">[5795]</a>that he was
unchaste, because his wife Aleida, the daughter of Henry, Landgrave of
Hesse, was so deformed. If she be poor, she brings beggary with her (saith
Nevisanus), misery and discontent. If you marry a maid, it is uncertain how
she proves, <span lang="la">Haec forsan veniet non satis apta tibi</span>. <a href="#note5796">[5796]</a>If young, she
is likely wanton and untaught; if lusty, too lascivious; and if she be not
satisfied, you know where and when, <span lang="la">nil nisi jurgia</span>, all is in an uproar,
and there is little quietness to be had; If an old maid, 'tis a hazard she
dies in childbed; if a <a href="#note5797">[5797]</a>rich widow, <span lang="la">induces te in laqueum</span>, thou

thee still in the teeth with her first husband; if a young widow, she is
often insatiable and immodest. If she be rich, well descended, bring a
great dowry, or be nobly allied, thy wife's friends will eat thee out of
house and home, <span lang="la">dives ruinam aedibus inducit</span>, she will be so proud, so

And therefore, with that philosopher, still make answer to thy friends that
importune thee to marry, <span lang="la">adhuc intempestivum</span>, 'tis yet unseasonable, and
ever will be.

<p>Consider withal how free, how happy, how secure, how heavenly, in respect,
a single man is, <a href="#note5803">[5803]</a>as he said in the comedy, <span lang="la">Et isti quod fortunatum
esse autumant, uxorem nunquam habui</span>, and that which all my neighbours
admire and applaud me for, account so great a happiness, I never had a
wife; consider how contentedly, quietly, neatly, plentifully, sweetly, and
how merrily he lives! he hath no man to care for but himself, none to
please, no charge, none to control him, is tied to no residence, no cure to
serve, may go and come, when, whither, live where he will, his own master,
and do what he list himself. Consider the excellency of virgins, <a href="#note5804">[5804]</a>
<span lang="la">Virgo coelum meruit</span>, marriage replenisheth the earth, but virginity
Paradise; Elias, Eliseus, John Baptist, were bachelors: virginity is a
precious jewel, a fair garland, a never-fading flower; <a href="#note5805">[5805]</a>for why was
Daphne turned to a green bay-tree, but to show that virginity is immortal?
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5806">[5806]</a>Ut flos in septis secretus nascitur hortis,</div>
<div class="line">Ignotus pecori, nullo contusus aratro,</div>
<div class="line">Quam mulcent aurae, firmat sol, educat imber, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line">Sic virgo dum intacta manet, dum chara suis, sed</div>
<div class="line">Cum Castum amisit, &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
Virginity is a fine picture, as <a href="#note5807">[5807]</a>Bonaventure calls it, a blessed
thing in itself, and if you will believe a Papist, meritorious. And
although there be some inconveniences, irksomeness, solitariness, &amp;c.,
incident to such persons, want of those comforts, <span lang="la">quae, aegro assideat et
curet aegrotum, fomentum paret, roget medicum</span>, &amp;c., embracing, dalliance,
kissing, colling, &amp;c., those furious motives and wanton pleasures a
new-married wife most part enjoys; yet they are but toys in respect, easily
to be endured, if conferred to those frequent encumbrances of marriage.
Solitariness may be otherwise avoided with mirth, music, good company,
business, employment; in a word, <a href="#note5808">[5808]</a><span lang="la">Gaudebit minus, et minus dolebit</span>;
for their good nights, he shall have good days. And methinks some time or
other, amongst so many rich bachelors, a benefactor should be found to
build a monastical college for old, decayed, deformed, or discontented
maids to live together in, that have lost their first loves, or otherwise
miscarried, or else are willing howsoever to lead a single life. The rest I
say are toys in respect, and sufficiently recompensed by those innumerable
contents and incomparable privileges of virginity. Think of these things,
confer both lives, and consider last of all these commodious prerogatives a
bachelor hath, how well he is esteemed, how heartily welcome to all his
friends, <span lang="la">quam mentitis obsequiis</span>, as Tertullian observes, with what
counterfeit courtesies they will adore him, follow him, present him with
gifts, <span lang="la">humatis donis</span>; <q>it cannot be believed</q> (saith <a href="#note5809">[5809]</a>Ammianus) <q>with
what humble service he shall be worshipped,</q> how loved and respected: <q>If
he want children, (and have means) he shall be often invited, attended on
by princes, and have advocates to plead his cause for nothing,</q> as <a href="#note5810">[5810]</a>
Plutarch adds. Wilt thou then be reverenced, and had in estimation?
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5811">[5811]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;dominus tamen et domini rex</div>
<div class="line">Si tu vis fieri, nullus tibi parvulus aula.</div>

<div class="line">Jucundum et charum sterilis facit uxor amicum.</div>
</div>
Live a single man, marry not, and thou shalt soon perceive how those
Haeredipetae (for so they were called of old) will seek after thee, bribe
and flatter thee for thy favour, to be thine heir or executor: Aruntius and
Aterius, those famous parasites in this kind, as Tacitus and <a href="#note5812">[5812]</a>Seneca
have recorded, shall not go beyond them. Periplectomines, that good
personate old man, <span lang="la">delicium senis</span>, well understood this in Plautus: for
when Pleusides exhorted him to marry that he might have children of his
own, he readily replied in this sort,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Quando habeo multos cognatos, quid opus mihi sit liberis?</div>
<div class="line">Nunc bene vivo et fortunate, atque animo ut lubet.</div>
<div class="line">Mea bona mea morte cognatis dicam interpartiant.</div>
<div class="line">Illi apud me edunt, me curant, visunt quid agam, ecquid velim,</div>
<div class="line">Qui mihi mittunt munera, ad prandium, ad coenam vocant.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Whilst I have kin, what need I brats to have?</div>
<div class="line">Now I live well, and as I will, most brave.</div>
<div class="line">And when I die, my goods I'll give away</div>
<div class="line">To them that do invite me every day.</div>
<div class="line">That visit me, and send me pretty toys,</div>
<div class="line">And strive who shall do me most courtesies.</div>

This respect thou shalt have in like manner, living as he did, a single
man. But if thou marry once, <a href="#note5813">[5813]</a><span lang="la">cogitato in omni vita te servum fore</span>,
bethink thyself what a slavery it is, what a heavy burden thou shalt
undertake, how hard a task thou art tied to, (for as Hierome hath it, <span lang="la">qui

what squalor attends it, what irksomeness, what charges, for wife and
children are a perpetual bill of charges; besides a myriad of cares,
miseries, and troubles; for as that comical Plautus merrily and truly said,
he that wants trouble, must get to be master of a ship, or marry a wife;
and as another seconds him, wife and children have undone me; so many and

<p>Where persuasions and other remedies will not take place, many fly to

the temple of Apollo to know what she should do to be eased of her pain:
Apollo sent her to Leucata Petra, where she precipitated herself, and was
forthwith freed; and when she would needs know of him a reason of it, he
told her again, that he had often observed <a href="#note5821">[5821]</a>Jupiter, when he was
enamoured on Juno, thither go to ease and wash himself, and after him
divers others. Cephalus for the love of Protela, Degonetus' daughter,
leaped down here, that Lesbian Sappho for Phaon, on whom she miserably
doted. <a href="#note5822">[5822]</a><span lang="la">Cupidinis aestro percita e summo praeceps ruit</span>, hoping thus
to ease herself, and to be freed of her love pangs.

Lethes</span>, <q>he took burning torches, and extinguished them in the river; his
statute was to be seen in the temple of Venus Eleusina,</q> of which Ovid
makes mention, and saith <q>that all lovers of old went thither on

Phocicis, writes of a temple dedicated <span lang="la">Veneri in spelunca</span>, to Venus in
the vault, at Naupactus in Achaia (now Lepanto) in which your widows that
would have second husbands, made their supplications to the goddess; all
manner of suits concerning lovers were commenced, and their grievances
helped. The same author, in Achaicis, tells as much of the river <a href="#note5826">[5826]</a>
Senelus in Greece; if any lover washed himself in it, by a secret virtue of
that water, (by reason of the extreme coldness belike) he was healed, of
love's torments, <a href="#note5827">[5827]</a><span lang="la">Amoris vulnus idem qui sanat facit</span>; which if it
be so, that water, as he holds, is <span lang="la">omni auro pretiosior</span>, better than any
gold. Where none of all these remedies will take place, I know no other but
that all lovers must make a head and rebel, as they did in <a href="#note5828">[5828]</a>Ausonius,
and crucify Cupid till he grant their request, or satisfy their desires.

<p>The last refuge and surest remedy, to be put in practice in the utmost

When you have all done, saith <a href="#note5833">[5833]</a>Avicenna, <q>there is no speedier or
safer course, than to join the parties together according to their desires
and wishes, the custom and form of law; and so we have seen him quickly
restored to his former health, that was languished away to skin and bones;
after his desire was satisfied, his discontent ceased, and we thought it
strange; our opinion is therefore that in such cases nature is to be
obeyed.</q> Areteus, an old author, <span class="cite">lib. 3. cap. 3.</span> hath an instance of a
young man, <a href="#note5834">[5834]</a>when no other means could prevail, was so speedily
relieved. What remains then but to join them in marriage?

<q>they may then kiss and coll, lie and look babies in one another's eyes,</q>
as heir sires before them did, they may then satiate themselves with love's
pleasures, which they have so long wished and expected;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Atque uno simul in toro quiescant,</div>
<div class="line">Conjuncto simul ore suavientur,</div>
<div class="line">Et somnos agitent quiete in una.</div>
</div>

<p>Yea, but <span lang="la">hic labor, hoc opus</span>, this cannot conveniently be done, by reason
of many and several impediments. Sometimes both parties themselves are not
agreed: parents, tutors, masters, guardians, will not give consent; laws,
customs, statutes hinder: poverty, superstition, fear and suspicion: many
men dote on one woman, <span lang="la">semel et simul</span>: she dotes as much on him, or them,
and in modesty must not, cannot woo, as unwilling to confess as willing to
love: she dare not make it known, show her affection, or speak her mind.
<q>And hard is the choice</q> (as it is in Euphues) <q>when one is compelled either
by silence to die with grief, or by speaking to live with shame.</q> In this
case almost was the fair lady Elizabeth, Edward the Fourth his daughter,
when she was enamoured on Henry the Seventh, that noble young prince, and
new saluted king, when she broke forth into that passionate speech, <a href="#note5836">[5836]</a>
<q>O that I were worthy of that comely prince! but my father being dead, I
want friends to motion such a matter! What shall I say? I am all alone, and
dare not open my mind to any. What if I acquaint my mother with it?
bashfulness forbids. What if some of the lords? audacity wants. O that I
might but confer with him, perhaps in discourse I might let slip such a
word that might discover mine intention!</q> How many modest maids may this
concern, I am a poor servant, what shall I do? I am a fatherless child, and
want means, I am blithe and buxom, young and lusty, but I have never a
suitor, <span lang="la">Expectant stolidi ut ego illos rogatum veniam</span>, as <a href="#note5837">[5837]</a>she
said, A company of silly fellows look belike that I should woo them and
speak first: fain they would and cannot woo,&mdash;<a href="#note5838">[5838]</a><span lang="la">quae primum exordia
sumam</span>? being merely passive they may not make suit, with many such lets
and inconveniences, which I know not; what shall we do in such a case? sing
<q>Fortune my foe?</q>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

<p>Some are so curious in this behalf, as those old Romans, our modern
Venetians, Dutch and French, that if two parties clearly love, the one
noble, the other ignoble, they may not by their laws match, though equal
otherwise in years, fortunes, education, and all good affection. In
Germany, except they can prove their gentility by three descents, they
scorn to match with them. A nobleman must marry a noblewoman: a baron, a
baron's daughter; a knight, a knight's; a gentleman, a gentleman's: as
slaters sort their slates, do they degrees and families. If she be never so
rich, fair, well qualified otherwise, they will make him forsake her. The
Spaniards abhor all widows; the Turks repute them old women, if past
five-and-twenty. But these are too severe laws, and strict customs, <span lang="la">dandum
aliquid amori</span>, we are all the sons of Adam, 'tis opposite to nature, it
ought not to be so. Again: he loves her most impotently, she loves not him,
and so <span lang="la">e contra</span>. <a href="#note5839">[5839]</a>Pan loved Echo, Echo Satyrus, Satyrus Lyda.

<p>And 'tis most true, many gentlewomen are so nice, they scorn all suitors,
crucify their poor paramours, and think nobody good enough for them, as
dainty to please as Daphne herself.

<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Many did woo her, but she scorn'd them still,</div>
<div class="line">And said she would not marry by her will.</div>
</div>
One while they will not marry, as they say at least, (when as they intend
nothing less) another while not yet, when 'tis their only desire, they rave
upon it. She will marry at last, but not him: he is a proper man indeed,
and well qualified, but he wants means: another of her suitors hath good
means, but he wants wit; one is too old, another too young, too deformed,
she likes not his carriage: a third too loosely given, he is rich, but base
born: she will be a gentlewoman, a lady, as her sister is, as her mother
is: she is all out as fair, as well brought up, hath as good a portion, and
she looks for as good a match, as Matilda or Dorinda: if not, she is
resolved as yet to tarry, so apt are young maids to boggle at every object,
so soon won or lost with every toy, so quickly diverted, so hard to be
pleased. In the meantime, <span lang="la">quot torsit amantes</span>? one suitor pines away,

Many young men are as obstinate, and as curious in their choice, as
tyrannically proud, insulting, deceitful, false-hearted, as irrefragable
and peevish on the other side; Narcissus-like,
<div class="poem" lang="la">

<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Fair Cupid, thy fair Psyche to thee sues,</div>

but he rejected her nevertheless. Thus many lovers do hold out so long,
doting on themselves, stand in their own light, till in the end they come
to be scorned and rejected, as Stroza's Gargiliana was,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Te juvenes, te odere senes, desertaque langues,</div>

As Narcissus was himself,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Who despising many.</div>
<div class="line">Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.</div>
</div>
They begin to be contemned themselves of others, as he was of his shadow,
and take up with a poor curate, or an old serving-man at last, that might
have had their choice of right good matches in their youth; like that
generous mare, in <a href="#note5854">[5854]</a>Plutarch, which would admit of none but great
horses, but when her tail was cut off and mane shorn close, and she now saw
herself so deformed in the water, when she came to drink, <span lang="la">ab asino

this is a common humour, will not be left, and cannot be helped.

their affection cannot be reconciled. Oftentimes they may and will not,
'tis their own foolish proceedings that mars all, they are too distrustful
of themselves, too soon dejected: say she be rich, thou poor: she young,

noble, thou base: she spruce and fine, but thou an ugly clown: <span lang="la">nil

They look to be wooed, sought after, and sued to. Most part they will and
cannot, either for the above-named reasons, or for that there is a
multitude of suitors equally enamoured, doting all alike; and where one
alone must speed, what shall become of the rest? Hero was beloved of many,
but one did enjoy her; Penelope had a company of suitors, yet all missed of
their aim. In such cases he or they must wisely and warily unwind
themselves, unsettle his affections by those rules above prescribed,&mdash;

bravely bear it out, as Turnus did, <span lang="la">Tua sit Lavinia conjux</span>, when he
could not get her, with a kind of heroical scorn he bid Aeneas take her, or
with a milder farewell, let her go. <span lang="la">Et Phillida solus habeto</span>, <q>Take her
to you, God give you joy, sir.</q> The fox in the emblem would eat no grapes,
but why? because he could not get them; care not then for that which may
not be had.

<p>Many such inconveniences, lets, and hindrances there are, which cross their
projects and crucify poor lovers, which sometimes may, sometimes again
cannot be so easily removed. But put case they be reconciled all, agreed
hitherto, suppose this love or good liking be between two alone, both
parties well pleased, there is <span lang="la">mutuus amor</span>, mutual love and great
affection; yet their parents, guardians, tutors, cannot agree, thence all
is dashed, the match is unequal: one rich, another poor: <span lang="la">durus pater</span>, a
hard-hearted, unnatural, a covetous father will not marry his son, except
he have so much money, <span lang="la">ita in aurum omnes insaniunt</span>, as <a href="#note5857">[5857]</a>Chrysostom
notes, nor join his daughter in marriage, to save her dowry, or for that he
cannot spare her for the service she doth him, and is resolved to part with
nothing whilst he lives, not a penny, though he may peradventure well give
it, he will not till he dies, and then as a pot of money broke, it is
divided amongst them that gaped after it so earnestly. Or else he wants
means to set her out, he hath no money, and though it be to the manifest
prejudice of her body and soul's health, he cares not, he will take no
notice of it, she must and shall tarry. Many slack and careless parents,
<span lang="la">iniqui patres</span>, measure their children's affections by their own, they are
now cold and decrepit themselves, past all such youthful conceits, and they
will therefore starve their children's genus, have them <span lang="la">a pueris <a href="#note5858">[5858]</a>
illico nasci senes</span>, they must not marry, <span lang="la">nec earum affines esse rerum
quas secum fert adolescentia: ex sua libidine moderatur quae est nunc, non
quae olim fuit</span>: as he said in the comedy: they will stifle nature, their
young bloods must not participate of youthful pleasures, but be as they are
themselves old on a sudden. And 'tis a general fault amongst most parents
in bestowing of their children, the father wholly respects wealth, when
through his folly, riot, indiscretion, he hath embezzled his estate, to
recover himself, he confines and prostitutes his eldest son's love and
affection to some fool, or ancient, or deformed piece for money.

and though his son utterly dislike, with Clitipho in the comedy, <span lang="la">Non
possum pater</span>: If she be rich, <span lang="la">Eia</span> (he replies) <span lang="la">ut elegans est, credas
animum ibi esse</span>? he must and shall have her, she is fair enough, young
enough, if he look or hope to inherit his lands, he shall marry, not when
or whom he loves, <span lang="la">Arconidis hujus filiam</span>, but whom his father commands,
when and where he likes, his affection must dance attendance upon him. His
daughter is in the same predicament forsooth, as an empty boat, she must
carry what, where, when, and whom her father will. So that in these
businesses the father is still for the best advantage; now the mother
respects good kindred, must part the son a proper woman. All which <a href="#note5860">[5860]</a>
Livy exemplifies, <span class="cite">dec. 1. lib. 4.</span> a gentleman and a yeoman wooed a wench
in Rome (contrary to that statute that the gentry and commonalty must not
match together); the matter was controverted: the gentleman was preferred
by the mother's voice, <span lang="la">quae quam splendissimis nuptiis jungi puellam
volebat</span>: the overseers stood for him that was most worth, &amp;c. But parents
ought not to be so strict in this behalf, beauty is a dowry of itself all
sufficient, <a href="#note5861">[5861]</a><span lang="la">Virgo formosa, etsi oppido pauper, abunde dotata est</span>,
<a href="#note5862">[5862]</a>Rachel was so married to Jacob, and Bonaventure, <a href="#note5863">[5863]</a><span class="cite">in 4.

comeliness of person.</q> The Jews, <span class="bibcite">Deut. xxi. 11</span>, if they saw amongst the
captives a beautiful woman, some small circumstances observed, might take
her to wife. They should not be too severe in that kind, especially if
there be no such urgent occasion, or grievous impediment. 'Tis good for a
commonwealth. <a href="#note5864">[5864]</a>Plato holds, that in their contracts <q>young men should
never avoid the affinity of poor folks, or seek after rich.</q> Poverty and
base parentage may be sufficiently recompensed by many other good
qualities, modesty, virtue, religion, and choice bringing up, <a href="#note5865">[5865]</a><q>I am
poor, I confess, but am I therefore contemptible, and an abject? Love
itself is naked, the graces; the stars, and Hercules clad in a lion's
skin.</q> Give something to virtue, love, wisdom, favour, beauty, person; be
not all for money. Besides, you must consider that <span lang="la">Amor cogi non potest</span>,
love cannot be compelled, they must affect as they may: <a href="#note5866">[5866]</a><span lang="la">Fatum est
in partibus illis quas sinus abscondit</span>, as the saying is, marriage and
hanging goes by destiny, matches are made in heaven.
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">It lies not in our power to love or hate,</div>
<div class="line">For will in us is overrul'd by fate.</div>
</div>
A servant maid in <a href="#note5867">[5867]</a>Aristaenetus loved her mistress's minion, which
when her dame perceived, <span lang="la">furiosa aemulatione</span> in a jealous humour she
dragged her about the house by the hair of the head, and vexed her sore.
The wench cried out, <a href="#note5868">[5868]</a><q>O mistress, fortune hath made my body your
servant, but not my soul!</q> Affections are free, not to be commanded.
Moreover it may be to restrain their ambition, pride, and covetousness, to
correct those hereditary diseases of a family, God in his just judgment
assigns and permits such matches to be made. For I am of Plato and <a href="#note5869">[5869]</a>
Bodine's mind, that families have their bounds and periods as well as
kingdoms, beyond which for extent or continuance they shall not exceed, six
or seven hundred years, as they there illustrate by a multitude of
examples, and which Peucer and <a href="#note5870">[5870]</a>Melancthon approve, but in a
perpetual tenor (as we see by many pedigrees of knights, gentlemen, yeomen)
continue as they began, for many descents with little alteration. Howsoever
let them, I say, give something to youth, to love; they must not think they
can fancy whom they appoint; <a href="#note5871">[5871]</a><span lang="la">Amor enim non imperatur, affectus
liber si quis alius et vices exigens</span>, this is a free passion, as Pliny
said in a panegyric of his, and may not be forced: Love craves liking, as
the saying is, it requires mutual affections, a correspondency: <span lang="la">invito non
datur nec aufertur</span>, it may not be learned, Ovid himself cannot teach us
how to love, Solomon describe, Apelles paint, or Helen express it. They
must not therefore compel or intrude; <a href="#note5872">[5872]</a><span lang="la">quis enim</span> (as Fabius urgeth)
<span lang="la">amare alieno animo potest</span>? but consider withal the miseries of enforced
marriages; take pity upon youth: and such above the rest as have daughters
to bestow, should be very careful and provident to marry them in due time.
Siracides <span class="bibcite">cap. 7. vers. 25.</span> calls it <q>a weighty matter to perform, so to
marry a daughter to a man of understanding in due time:</q> <span lang="la">Virgines enim
tempestive locandae</span>, as <a href="#note5873">[5873]</a>Lemnius admonisheth, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 6.</span>
Virgins must be provided for in season, to prevent many diseases, of which
<a href="#note5874">[5874]</a>Rodericus a Castro <span class="cite">de morbis mulierum, lib. 2. cap. 3.</span> and Lod.
Mercatus <span class="cite">lib. 2. de mulier. affect, cap. 4, de melanch. virginum et
viduarum</span>, have both largely discoursed. And therefore as well to avoid
these feral maladies, 'tis good to get them husbands betimes, as to prevent
some other gross inconveniences, and for a thing that I know besides; <span lang="la">ubi
nuptiarum tempus et aetas advenerit</span>, as Chrysostom adviseth, let them not
defer it; they perchance will marry themselves else, or do worse. If
Nevisanus the lawyer do not impose, they may do it by right: for as he
proves out of Curtius, and some other civilians, Sylvae, <span class="cite">nup. lib. 2.
numer. 30.</span> <a href="#note5875">[5875]</a><q>A maid past twenty-five years of age, against her
parents' consent may marry such a one as is unworthy of, and inferior to
her, and her father by law must be compelled to give her a competent
dowry.</q> Mistake me not in the mean time, or think that I do apologise here
for any headstrong, unruly, wanton flirts. I do approve that of St. Ambrose
(<span class="cite">Comment. in Genesis xxiv. 51</span>), which he hath written touching Rebecca's
spousals, <q>A woman should give unto her parents the choice of her husband,
<a href="#note5876">[5876]</a>lest she be reputed to be malapert and wanton, if she take upon her
to make her own choice; <a href="#note5877">[5877]</a>for she should rather seem to be desired by
a man, than to desire a man herself.</q> To those hard parents alone I retort
that of Curtius, (in the behalf of modester maids), that are too remiss and
careless of their due time and riper years. For if they tarry longer, to
say truth, they are past date, and nobody will respect them. A woman with
us in Italy (saith <a href="#note5878">[5878]</a>Aretine's Lucretia) twenty-four years of age, <q>is
old already, past the best, of no account.</q> An old fellow, as Lycistrata
confesseth in <a href="#note5879">[5879]</a>Aristophanes, <span lang="la">etsi sit canus, cito puellam virginem
ducat uxorem</span>, and 'tis no news for an old fellow to marry a young wench:
but as he follows it, <span lang="la">mulieris brevis occasio est, etsi hoc non
apprehenderit, nemo vult ducere uxorem, expectans vero sedet</span>; who cares
for an old maid? she may set, &amp;c. A virgin, as the poet holds, <span lang="la">lasciva et
petulans puella virgo</span>, is like a flower, a rose withered on a sudden.

<span lang="la">Volat irrevocabile tempus</span>, time past cannot be recalled. But we need no
such exhortation, we are all commonly too forward: yet if there be any
escape, and all be not as it should, as Diogenes struck the father when the
son swore, because he taught him no better, if a maid or young man
miscarry, I think their parents oftentimes, guardians, overseers,
governors, <span lang="la">neque vos</span> (saith <a href="#note5884">[5884]</a>Chrysostom) <span lang="la">a supplicio immunes
evadetis, si non statim ad nuptias</span>, &amp;c. are in as much fault, and as
severely to be punished as their children, in providing for them no sooner.

<p>Now for such as have free liberty to bestow themselves, I could wish that
good counsel of the comical old man were put in practice,
<div class="poem" lang="la">

If they would care less for wealth, we should have much more content and

sufficient portion of itself, <a href="#note5886">[5886]</a><span lang="la">Dos est sua forma puellis</span>, <q>her
beauty is a maiden's dower,</q> and he doth well that will accept of such a

non illaetabili</span>, of a merry countenance, and heavenly visage, in pity of
her estate, and that quickly. Acontius coming to Delos, to sacrifice to
Diana, fell in love with Cydippe, a noble lass, and wanting means to get
her love, flung a golden apple into her lap, with this inscription upon it,
<div class="poem" lang="la">

was married unto him.

<div class="line">Blessed is the wooing,</div>

As the saying is; when the parties are sufficiently known to each other,
what needs such scrupulosity, so many circumstances? dost thou know her
conditions, her bringing-up, like her person? let her means be what they
will, take her without any more ado. <a href="#note5888">[5888]</a>Dido and Aeneas were
accidentally driven by a storm both into one cave, they made a match upon
it; Massinissa was married to that fair captive Sophonisba, King Syphax'
wife, the same day that he saw her first, to prevent Scipio Laelius, lest
they should determine otherwise of her. If thou lovest the party, do as
much: good education and beauty is a competent dowry, stand not upon money.
<span lang="la">Erant olim aurei homines</span> (saith Theocritus) <span lang="la">et adamantes redamabant</span>, in
the golden world men did so, (in the reign of <a href="#note5889">[5889]</a>Ogyges belike, before
staggering Ninus began to domineer) if all be true that is reported: and
some few nowadays will do as much, here and there one; 'tis well done
methinks, and all happiness befall them for so doing. <a href="#note5890">[5890]</a>Leontius, a
philosopher of Athens, had a fair daughter called Athenais, <span lang="la">multo corporis
lepore ac Venere</span>, (saith mine author) of a comely carriage, he gave her no
portion but her bringing up, <span lang="la">occulto formae, praesagio</span>, out of some secret
foreknowledge of her fortune, bestowing that little which he had amongst
his other children. But she, thus qualified, was preferred by some friends
to Constantinople, to serve Pulcheria, the emperor's sister, of whom she
was baptised and called Eudocia. Theodosius, the emperor, in short space
took notice of her excellent beauty and good parts, and a little after,
upon his sister's sole commendation, made her his wife: 'twas nobly done of
Theodosius. <a href="#note5891">[5891]</a>Rudophe was the fairest lady in her days in all Egypt;
she went to wash her, and by chance, (her maids meanwhile looking but
carelessly to her clothes) an eagle stole away one of her shoes, and laid
it in Psammeticus the King of Egypt's lap at Memphis: he wondered at the
excellency of the shoe and pretty foot, but more <span lang="la">Aquilae, factum</span>, at the
manner of the bringing of it: and caused forthwith proclamation to be made,
that she that owned that shoe should come presently to his court; the
virgin came, and was forthwith married to the king. I say this was
heroically done, and like a prince: I commend him for it, and all such as
have means, that will either do (as he did) themselves, or so for love,
&amp;c., marry their children. If he be rich, let him take such a one as wants,
if she be virtuously given; for as Siracides, <span class="bibcite">cap. 7. ver. 19.</span> adviseth,
<q>Forego not a wife and good woman; for her grace is above gold.</q> If she
have fortunes of her own, let her make a man. Danaus of Lacedaemon had a
many daughters to bestow, and means enough for them all, he never stood
inquiring after great matches, as others used to do, but <a href="#note5892">[5892]</a>sent for a
company of brave young gallants to his house, and bid his daughters choose
every one one, whom she liked best, and take him for her husband, without
any more ado. This act of his was much approved in those times. But in this
iron age of ours, we respect riches alone, (for a maid must buy her husband
now with a great dowry, if she will have him) covetousness and filthy lucre
mars all good matches, or some such by-respects. Crales, a Servian prince
(as Nicephorus Gregoras <span class="cite">Rom. hist. lib. 6.</span> relates it,) was an earnest
suitor to Eudocia, the emperor's sister; though her brother much desired
it, yet she could not <a href="#note5893">[5893]</a>abide him, for he had three former wives, all
basely abused; but the emperor still, <span lang="la">Cralis amicitiam magni faciens</span>,
because he was a great prince, and a troublesome neighbour, much desired
his affinity, and to that end betrothed his own daughter Simonida to him, a
little girl five years of age (he being forty-five,) and five <a href="#note5894">[5894]</a>years
older than the emperor himself: such disproportionable and unlikely matches
can wealth and a fair fortune make. And yet not that alone, it is not only
money, but sometimes vainglory, pride, ambition, do as much harm as
wretched covetousness itself in another extreme. If a yeoman have one sole
daughter, he must overmatch her, above her birth and calling, to a
gentleman forsooth, because of her great portion, too good for one of her
own rank, as he supposeth: a gentleman's daughter and heir must be married
to a knight baronet's eldest son at least; and a knight's only daughter to
a baron himself, or an earl, and so upwards, her great dower deserves it.
And thus striving for more honour to their wealth, they undo their
children, many discontents follow, and oftentimes they ruinate their
families. <a href="#note5895">[5895]</a>Paulus Jovius gives instance in Galeatius the Second, that
heroical Duke of Milan, <span lang="la">externas affinitates, decoras quidem regio fastu,
sed sibi et posteris damnosas et fere exitiales quaesivit</span>; he married his
eldest son John Galeatius to Isabella the King of France his sister, but
she was <span lang="la">socero tam gravis, ut ducentis millibus aureorum constiterit</span>, her
entertainment at Milan was so costly that it almost undid him. His daughter
Violanta was married to Lionel Duke of Clarence, the youngest son to Edward
the Third, King of England, but, <span lang="la">ad ejus adventum tantae opes tam
admirabili liberalitate profusae sunt, ut opulentissimorum regum splendorem
superasse videretur</span>, he was welcomed with such incredible magnificence,
that a king's purse was scarce able to bear it; for besides many rich
presents of horses, arms, plate, money, jewels, &amp;c., he made one dinner for
him and his company, in which were thirty-two messes and as much provision
left, <span lang="la">ut relatae a mensa dapes decem millibus hominum sufficerent</span>, as
would serve ten thousand men: but a little after Lionel died, <span lang="la">novae nuptae
et intempestivis conviviis operam dans</span>, &amp;c., and to the duke's great loss,
the solemnity was ended. So can titles, honours, ambition, make many brave,
but unfortunate matches of all sides for by-respects, (though both crazed
in body and mind, most unwilling, averse, and often unfit,) so love is
banished, and we feel the smart of it in the end. But I am too lavish
peradventure in this subject.

<p>Another let or hindrance is strict and severe discipline, laws and rigorous
customs, that forbid men to marry at set times, and in some places; as
apprentices, servants, collegiates, states of lives in copyholds, or in
some base inferior offices, <a href="#note5896">[5896]</a><span lang="la">Velle licet</span> in such cases, <span lang="la">potiri non
licet</span>, as he said. They see but as prisoners through a grate, they covet
and catch, but <span lang="la">Tantalus a labris</span>, &amp;c. Their love is lost, and vain it is
in such an estate to attempt. <a href="#note5897">[5897]</a><span lang="la">Gravissimum est adamare nec potiri</span>,
'tis a grievous thing to love and not enjoy. They may, indeed, I deny not,
marry if they will, and have free choice, some of them; but in the meantime
their case is desperate, <span lang="la">Lupum auribus tenent</span>, they hold a wolf by the
ears, they must either burn or starve. 'Tis <span lang="la">cornutum sophisma</span>, hard to
resolve, if they marry they forfeit their estates, they are undone, and
starve themselves through beggary and want: if they do not marry, in this
heroical passion they furiously rage, are tormented, and torn in pieces by
their predominate affections. Every man hath not the gift of continence,
let him <a href="#note5898">[5898]</a>pray for it then, as Beza adviseth in his Tract <span class="cite">de
Divortiis</span>, because God hath so called him to a single life, in taking away
the means of marriage. <a href="#note5899">[5899]</a>Paul would have gone from Mysia to Bithynia,
but the spirit suffered him not, and thou wouldst peradventure be a married
man with all thy will, but that protecting angel holds it not fit. The
devil too sometimes may divert by his ill suggestions, and mar many good
matches, as the same <a href="#note5900">[5900]</a>Paul was willing to see the Romans, but
hindered of Satan he could not. There be those that think they are
necessitated by fate, their stars have so decreed, and therefore they
grumble at their hard fortune, they are well inclined to marry, but one rub
or other is ever in the way; I know what astrologers say in this behalf,
what Ptolemy <span class="cite">quadripartit. Tract. 4. cap. 4.</span> Skoner <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap.
12.</span> what Leovitius <span class="cite">genitur. exempl. 1.</span> which Sextus ab Heminga takes to
be the horoscope of Hieronymus Wolfius, what Pezelius, Origanaus and
Leovitius his illustrator Garceus, <span class="cite">cap. 12.</span> what Junctine, Protanus,
Campanella, what the rest, (to omit those Arabian conjectures <span lang="la">a parte
conjugii, a parte lasciviae, triplicitates veneris</span>, &amp;c., and those
resolutions upon a question, <span lang="la">an amica potiatur</span>, &amp;c.) determine in this
behalf, viz. <span lang="la">an sit natus conjugem habiturus, facile an difficulter sit
sponsam impetraturus, quot conjuges, quo tempore, quales decernantur nato
uxores, de mutuo amore conjugem</span>, both in men's and women's genitures, by
the examination of the seventh house the almutens, lords and planets there,
<span lang="la">a &#x2609;d et &#x263E;a</span> &amp;c., by particular aphorisms, <span lang="la">Si dominus 7<sup>mae</sup> in
7<sup>ma</sup> vel secunda nobilem decernit uxorem, servam aut ignobilem si
duodecima. Si Venus in 12<sup>ma</sup></span>, &amp;c., with many such, too tedious to relate.
Yet let no man be troubled, or find himself grieved with such predictions,
as Hier. Wolfius well saith in his astrological <a href="#note5901">[5901]</a>dialogue, <span lang="la">non sunt
praetoriana decreta</span>, they be but conjectures, the stars incline, but not
enforce,

decrees, <span lang="la">Fortuna sua a cujusque fingitur moribus</span>, <a href="#note5903">[5903]</a><span lang="la">Qui cauti,
prudentes, voti compotes</span>, &amp;c., let no man then be terrified or molested
with such astrological aphorisms, or be much moved, either to vain hope or
fear, from such predictions, but let every man follow his own free will in
this case, and do as he sees cause. Better it is indeed to marry than burn,
for their soul's health, but for their present fortunes, by some other
means to pacify themselves, and divert the stream of this fiery torrent, to
continue as they are, <a href="#note5904">[5904]</a>rest satisfied, <span lang="la">lugentes virginitatis florem
sic aruisse</span>, deploring their misery with that eunuch in Libanius, since
there is no help or remedy, and with Jephtha's daughter to bewail their
virginities.

<p>Of like nature is superstition, those rash vows of monks and friars, and
such as live in religious orders, but far more tyrannical and much worse.
Nature, youth, and his furious passion forcibly inclines, and rageth on the
one side; but their order and vow checks them on the other. <a href="#note5905">[5905]</a><span lang="la">Votoque
suo sua forma repugnat.</span> What merits and indulgences they heap unto
themselves by it, what commodities, I know not; but I am sure, from such
rash vows, and inhuman manner of life, proceed many inconveniences, many
diseases, many vices, mastupration, satyriasis, <a href="#note5906">[5906]</a>priapismus,
melancholy, madness, fornication, adultery, buggery, sodomy, theft, murder,
and all manner of mischiefs: read but Bale's Catalogue of Sodomites, at the
visitation of abbeys here in England, Henry Stephan. his Apol. for
Herodotus, that which Ulricus writes in one of his epistles, <a href="#note5907">[5907]</a><q>that
Pope Gregory when he saw 600 skulls and bones of infants taken out of a
fishpond near a nunnery, thereupon retracted that decree of priests'
marriages, which was the cause of such a slaughter, was much grieved at it,
and purged himself by repentance.</q> Read many such, and then ask what is to
be done, is this vow to be broke or not? No, saith Bellarmine, <span class="cite">cap. 38.
lib. de Monach.</span> <span lang="la">melius est scortari et uri quam de voto coelibatus ad
nuptias transire</span>, better burn or fly out, than to break thy vow. And
Coster in his <span class="cite">Enchirid. de coelibat. sacerdotum</span>, saith it is absolutely
<span lang="la">gravius peccatum</span>, <a href="#note5908">[5908]</a><q>a greater sin for a priest to marry, than to
keep a concubine at home.</q> Gregory de Valence, <span class="cite">cap. 6. de coelibat.</span>
maintains the same, as those of Essei and Montanists of old. Insomuch that
many votaries, out of a false persuasion of merit and holiness in this
kind, will sooner die than marry, though it be to the saving of their
lives. <a href="#note5909">[5909]</a>Anno 1419. Pius 2, Pope, James Rossa, nephew to the King of
Portugal, and then elect Archbishop of Lisbon, being very sick at Florence,
<a href="#note5910">[5910]</a><q>when his physicians told him, that his disease was such, he must
either lie with a wench, marry, or die, cheerfully chose to die.</q> Now they
commended him for it; but St. Paul teacheth otherwise, <q>Better marry than
burn,</q> and as St. Hierome gravely delivers it, <span lang="la">Aliae, sunt leges Caesarum,
aliae Christi, aliud Papinianus, aliud Paulus noster praecipit</span>, there's a
difference betwixt God's ordinances and men's laws: and therefore Cyprian
<span class="cite">Epist. 8.</span> boldly denounceth, <span lang="la">impium est, adulterum est, sacrilegum est,
quodcunque humano furore statuitur, ut dispositio divina violetur</span>, it is
abominable, impious, adulterous, and sacrilegious, what men make and ordain
after their own furies to cross God's laws. <a href="#note5911">[5911]</a>Georgius Wicelius, one
of their own arch divines (<span class="cite">Inspect. eccles. pag. 18</span>) exclaims against it,
and all such rash monastical vows, and would have such persons seriously to
consider what they do, whom they admit, <span lang="la">ne in posterum querantur de
inanibus stupris</span>, lest they repent it at last. For either, as he follows
it, <a href="#note5912">[5912]</a>you must allow them concubines, or suffer them to marry, for
scarce shall you find three priests of three thousand, <span lang="la">qui per aetatem non
ament</span>, that are not troubled with burning lust. Wherefore I conclude it is
an unnatural and impious thing to bar men of this Christian liberty, too
severe and inhuman an edict.

Many laymen repine still at priests' marriages above the rest, and not at
clergymen only, but of all the meaner sort and condition, they would have
none marry but such as are rich and able to maintain wives, because their
parish belike shall be pestered with orphans, and the world full of
beggars: but <a href="#note5914">[5914]</a>these are hard-hearted, unnatural, monsters of men,
shallow politicians, they do not <a href="#note5915">[5915]</a>consider that a great part of the
world is not yet inhabited as it ought, how many colonies into America,
Terra Australis incognita, Africa, may be sent? Let them consult with Sir
William Alexander's Book of Colonies, Orpheus Junior's Golden Fleece,
Captain Whitburne, Mr. Hagthorpe, &amp;c. and they shall surely be otherwise
informed. Those politic Romans were of another mind, they thought their
city and country could never be too populous. <a href="#note5916">[5916]</a>Adrian the emperor
said he had rather have men than money, <span lang="la">malle se hominum adjectione
ampliare imperium, quam pecunia</span>. Augustus Caesar made an oration in Rome
<span lang="la">ad caelibus</span>, to persuade them to marry; some countries compelled them to
marry of old, as <a href="#note5917">[5917]</a>Jews, Turks, Indians, Chinese, amongst the rest in
these days, who much wonder at our discipline to suffer so many idle
persons to live in monasteries, and often marvel how they can live honest.
<a href="#note5918">[5918]</a>In the isle of Maragnan, the governor and petty king there did
wonder at the Frenchmen, and admire how so many friars, and the rest of
their company could live without wives, they thought it a thing impossible,
and would not believe it. If these men should but survey our multitudes of
religious houses, observe our numbers of monasteries all over Europe, 18
nunneries in Padua, in Venice 34 cloisters of monks, 28 of nuns, &amp;c. <span lang="la">ex
ungue leonem</span>, 'tis to this proportion, in all other provinces and cities,
what would they think, do they live honest? Let them dissemble as they
will, I am of Tertullian's mind, that few can continue but by compulsion.
<a href="#note5919">[5919]</a><q>O chastity</q> (saith he) <q>thou art a rare goddess in the world, not so
easily got, seldom continuate: thou mayst now and then be compelled,
either for defect of nature, or if discipline persuade, decrees enforce:</q>
or for some such by-respects, sullenness, discontent, they have lost their
first loves, may not have whom they will themselves, want of means, rash
vows, &amp;c. But can he willingly contain? I think not. Therefore, either out
of commiseration of human imbecility, in policy, or to prevent a far worse
inconvenience, for they hold some of them as necessary as meat and drink,
and because vigour of youth, the state and temper of most men's bodies do
so furiously desire it, they have heretofore in some nations liberally
admitted polygamy and stews, a hundred thousand courtesans in Grand Cairo
in Egypt, as <a href="#note5920">[5920]</a>Radzivilus observes, are tolerated, besides boys: how
many at Fez, Rome, Naples, Florence, Venice, &amp;c., and still in many other
provinces and cities of Europe they do as much, because they think young
men, churchmen, and servants amongst the rest, can hardly live honest. The
consideration of this belike made Vibius, the Spaniard, when his friend
<a href="#note5921">[5921]</a>Crassus, that rich Roman gallant, lay hid in the cave, <span lang="la">ut
voluptatis quam aetas illa desiderat copiam faceret</span>, to gratify him the
more, send two <a href="#note5922">[5922]</a>lusty lasses to accompany him all that while he was
there imprisoned, And Surenus, the Parthian general, when he warred against
the Romans, to carry about with him 200 concubines, as the Swiss soldiers
do now commonly their wives. But, because this course is not generally
approved, but rather contradicted as unlawful and abhorred, <a href="#note5923">[5923]</a>in most
countries they do much encourage them to marriage, give great rewards to
such as have many children, and mulct those that will not marry, <span lang="la">Jus trium
liberorum</span>, and in Agellius, <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 15.</span> Elian. <span class="cite">lib. 6. cap. 5.</span>
Valerius, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 9.</span> <a href="#note5924">[5924]</a>We read that three children freed the
father from painful offices, and five from all contribution. <q>A woman shall
be saved by bearing children.</q> Epictetus would have all marry, and as
<a href="#note5925">[5925]</a>Plato will, <span class="cite">6 de legibus</span>, he that marrieth not before 35 years of
his age, must be compelled and punished, and the money consecrated to
<a href="#note5926">[5926]</a>Juno's temple, or applied to public uses. They account him, in some
countries, unfortunate that dies without a wife, a most unhappy man, as
<a href="#note5927">[5927]</a>Boethius infers, and if at all happy, yet <span lang="la">infortunio felix</span>, unhappy
in his supposed happiness. They commonly deplore his estate, and much
lament him for it: O, my sweet son, &amp;c. See Lucian, <span class="cite">de Luctu</span>, Sands <span class="cite">fol.
83</span>, &amp;c.

<p>Yet, notwithstanding, many with us are of the opposite part, they are
married themselves, and for others, let them burn, fire and flame, they
care not, so they be not troubled with them. Some are too curious, and some
too covetous, they may marry when they will both for ability and means, but
so nice, that except as Theophilus the emperor was presented, by his mother
Euprosune, with all the rarest beauties of the empire in the great chamber
of his palace at once, and bid to give a golden apple to her he liked best.
If they might so take and choose whom they list out of all the fair maids
their nation affords, they could happily condescend to marry: otherwise,
&amp;c., why should a man marry, saith another epicurean rout, what's matrimony
but a matter of money? why should free nature be entrenched on, confined or
obliged, to this or that man or woman, with these manacles of body and
goods? &amp;c. There are those too that dearly love, admire and follow women
all their lives long, <span lang="la">sponsi Penelopes</span>, never well but in their company,
wistly gazing on their beauties, observing close, hanging after them,
dallying still with them, and yet dare not, will not marry. Many poor
people, and of the meaner sort, are too distrustful of God's providence,
<q>they will not, dare not for such worldly respects,</q> fear of want, woes,
miseries, or that they shall light, as <a href="#note5928">[5928]</a><q>Lemnius saith, on a scold, a
slut, or a bad wife.</q> And therefore, <a href="#note5929">[5929]</a><span lang="la">Tristem Juventam venere
deserta colunt</span>, they are resolved to live single, as <a href="#note5930">[5930]</a>Epaminondas
did, <a href="#note5931">[5931]</a><span lang="la">Nil ait esse prius, melius nil coelibe vita</span>, and ready
with Hippolitus to abjure all women, <a href="#note5932">[5932]</a><span lang="la">Detestor omnes, horreo, fugio,
execror</span>, &amp;c. But,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Hippolite nescis quod fugis vitae bonum,</div>
<div class="line">Hippolite nescis&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
<q>alas, poor Hippolitus, thou knowest not what thou sayest, 'tis otherwise,
Hippolitus.</q> <a href="#note5933">[5933]</a>Some make a doubt, <span lang="la">an uxor literato sit ducenda</span>,
whether a scholar should marry, if she be fair she will bring him back from
his grammar to his horn book, or else with kissing and dalliance she will
hinder his study; if foul with scolding, he cannot well intend to do both,
as Philippus Beroaldus, that great Bononian doctor, once writ, <span lang="la">impediri
enim studia literarum</span>, &amp;c., but he recanted at last, and in a solemn sort
with true conceived words he did ask the world and all women forgiveness.
But you shall have the story as he relates himself, in his Commentaries on
the sixth of Apuleius. For a long time I lived a single life, <span lang="la">et ab uxore
ducenda semper abhorrui, nec quicquam libero lecto censui jucundius</span>. I
could not abide marriage, but as a rambler, <span lang="la">erraticus ac volaticus amator</span>
(to use his own words) <span lang="la">per multiplices amores discurrebam</span>, I took a
snatch where I could get it; nay more, I railed at marriage downright, and
in a public auditory, when I did interpret that sixth Satire of Juvenal,
out of Plutarch and Seneca, I did heap up all the dicteries I could against
women; but now recant with Stesichorus, <span lang="la">palinodiam cano, nec poenitet
censeri in ordine maritorum</span>, I approve of marriage, I am glad I am a
<a href="#note5934">[5934]</a>married man, I am heartily glad I have a wife, so sweet a wife, so
noble a wife, so young, so chaste a wife, so loving a wife, and I do wish
and desire all other men to marry; and especially scholars, that as of old
Martia did by Hortensius, Terentia by Tullius, Calphurnia to Plinius,
Pudentilla to Apuleius, <a href="#note5935">[5935]</a>hold the candle whilst their husbands did
meditate and write, so theirs may do them, and as my dear Camilla doth to
me. Let other men be averse, rail then and scoff at women, and say what
they can to the contrary, <span lang="la">vir sine uxore malorum expers est</span>, &amp;c., a
single man is a happy man, &amp;c., but this is a toy. <a href="#note5936">[5936]</a><span lang="la">Nec dulces
amores sperne puer, neque tu choreas</span>; these men are too distrustful and
much to blame, to use such speeches, <a href="#note5937">[5937]</a><span lang="la">Parcite paucorum diffundere,
crimen in omnes</span>. <q>They must not condemn all for some.</q> As there be many
bad, there be some good wives; as some be vicious, some be virtuous. Read
what Solomon hath said in their praises, <span class="bibcite">Prov. xiii.</span> and Siracides, <span class="bibcite">cap.
26 et 30</span>, <q>Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the number of
his days shall be double. A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and she
shall fulfil the years of his life in peace. A good wife is a good portion</q>
(and <span class="bibcite">xxxvi. 24</span>), <q>an help, a pillar of rest,</q> <span lang="la">columina quietis</span>, <a href="#note5938">[5938]</a>

wife wandereth to and fro mourning.</q> <span lang="la">Minuuntur atrae conjuge curae</span>, women

saith our Latin Homer, she is still the same in sickness and in health, his
eye, his hand, his bosom friend, his partner at all times, his other self,
not to be separated by any calamity, but ready to share all sorrow,
discontent, and as the Indian women do, live and die with him, nay more, to
die presently for him. Admetus, king of Thessaly, when he lay upon his
death-bed, was told by Apollo's Oracle, that if he could get anybody to die
for him, he should live longer yet, but when all refused, his parents,
<span lang="la">etsi decrepiti</span>, friends and followers forsook him, Alcestus, his wife,
though young, most willingly undertook it; what more can be desired or
expected? And although on the other side there be an infinite number of bad
husbands (I should rail downright against some of them), able to discourage
any women; yet there be some good ones again, and those most observant of
marriage rites. An honest country fellow (as Fulgosus relates it) in the
kingdom of Naples, <a href="#note5943">[5943]</a>at plough by the seaside, saw his wife carried
away by Mauritanian pirates, he ran after in all haste, up to the chin
first, and when he could wade no longer, swam, calling to the governor of
the ship to deliver his wife, or if he must not have her restored, to let
him follow as a prisoner, for he was resolved to be a galley-slave, his
drudge, willing to endure any misery, so that he might but enjoy his dear
wife. The Moors seeing the man's constancy, and relating the whole matter
to their governors at Tunis, set them both free, and gave them an honest
pension to maintain themselves during their lives. I could tell many
stories to this effect; but put case it often prove otherwise, because
marriage is troublesome, wholly therefore to avoid it, is no argument;
<a href="#note5944">[5944]</a><q>He that will avoid trouble must avoid the world.</q> (Eusebius
<span class="cite">praepar. Evangel. 5. cap. 50.</span>) Some trouble there is in marriage I deny
not, <span lang="la">Etsi grave sit matrimonium</span>, saith Erasmus, <span lang="la">edulcatur tamen multis</span>,
&amp;c., yet there be many things to <a href="#note5945">[5945]</a>sweeten it, a pleasant wife,
<span lang="la">placens uxor</span>, pretty children, <span lang="la">dulces nati, deliciae filiorum hominum</span>,
the chief delight of the sons of men; <span class="bibcite">Eccles. ii. 8.</span> &amp;c. And howsoever
though it were all troubles, <a href="#note5946">[5946]</a><span lang="la">utilitatis publicae causa devorandum,

good's sake,

For to what end is a man born? why lives he, but to increase the world? and
how shall he do that well, if he do not marry? <span lang="la">Matrimonium humano generi
immortalitatem tribuit</span>, saith Nevisanus, matrimony makes us immortal, and
according to <a href="#note5950">[5950]</a>Tacitus, 'tis <span lang="la">firmissimum imperii munimentum</span>, the sole
and chief prop of an empire. <a href="#note5951">[5951]</a><span lang="la">Indigne vivit per quem non vivit et

as <a href="#note5953">[5953]</a>Trismegistus to his son Tatius, <q>have no commerce with a single
man:</q> Holding belike that a bachelor could not live honestly as he should,
and with Georgius Wicelius, a great divine and holy man, who of late by
twenty-six arguments commends marriage as a thing most necessary for all
kinds of persons, most laudable and fit to be embraced: and is persuaded
withal, that no man can live and die religiously, and as he ought, without
a wife, <span lang="la">persuasus neminem posse neque pie vivere, neque bene mori citra
uxorem</span>, he is false, an enemy to the commonwealth, injurious to himself,
destructive to the world, an apostate to nature, a rebel against heaven and
earth. Let our wilful, obstinate, and stale bachelors ruminate of this, <q>If
we could live without wives,</q> as Marcellus Numidicus said in <a href="#note5954">[5954]</a>
Agellius, <q>we would all want them; but because we cannot, let all marry,
and consult rather to the public good, than their own private pleasure or
estate.</q> It were an happy thing, as wise <a href="#note5955">[5955]</a>Euripides hath it, if we
could buy children with gold and silver, and be so provided, <span lang="la">sine mulierum
congressu</span>, without women's company; but that may not be:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5956">[5956]</a>Orbis jacebit squallido turpis situ,</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Earth, air, sea, land eftsoon would come to nought,</div>
<div class="line">The world itself should be to ruin brought.</div>

Necessity therefore compels us to marry.

<p>But what do I trouble myself, to find arguments to persuade to, or commend
marriage? behold a brief abstract of all that which I have said, and much
more, succinctly, pithily, pathetically, perspicuously, and elegantly
delivered in twelve motions to mitigate the miseries of marriage, by <a href="#note5957">[5957]</a>
Jacobus de Voragine,

<p><span lang="la">1. Res est? habes quae tucatur et augeat.&mdash;2. Non est? habes quae
quaerat.&mdash;3. Secundae res sunt? felicitas duplicatur.&mdash;4. Adversae sunt?
Consolatur, adsidet, onus participat ut tolerabile fiat.&mdash;5. Domi es?
solitudinis taedium pellit.&mdash;6. Foras? Discendentem visu prosequitur,
absentem desiderat, redeuntem laeta excipit.&mdash;7. Nihil jucundum absque
societate? Nulla societas matrimonio suavior.&mdash;8. Vinculum conjugalis
charitatis adamentinum.&mdash;9. Accrescit dulcis affinium turba, duplicatur
numerus parentum, fratrum, sororum, nepotum.&mdash;10. Pulchra sis prole
parens.&mdash;11. Lex Mosis sterilitatem matrimonii execratur, quanto amplius
coelibatum?&mdash;12. Si natura poenam non effugit, ne voluntas quidem
effugiet</span>.

<p>1. Hast thou means? thou hast none to keep and increase it.&mdash;2. Hast none?
thou hast one to help to get it.&mdash;3. Art in prosperity? thine happiness is
doubled.&mdash;4. Art in adversity? she'll comfort, assist, bear a part of thy
burden to make it more tolerable.&mdash;5. Art at home? she'll drive away
melancholy.&mdash;6. Art abroad? she looks after thee going from home, wishes
for thee in thine absence, and joyfully welcomes thy return.&mdash;7. There's
nothing delightsome without society, no society so sweet as matrimony.&mdash;8.
The band of conjugal love is adamantine.&mdash;9. The sweet company of kinsmen
increaseth, the number of parents is doubled, of brothers, sisters,
nephews.&mdash;10. Thou art made a father by a fair and happy issue.&mdash;11. Moses
curseth the barrenness of matrimony, how much more a single life?&mdash;12. If
nature escape not punishment, surely thy will shall not avoid it.

<p>All this is true, say you, and who knows it not? but how easy a matter is
it to answer these motives, and to make an <span lang="la">Antiparodia</span> quite opposite
unto it? To exercise myself I will essay:

<p>1. Hast thou means? thou hast one to spend it.&mdash;2. Hast none? thy beggary
is increased.&mdash;3. Art in prosperity? thy happiness is ended.&mdash;4. Art in
adversity? like Job's wife she'll aggravate thy misery, vex thy soul, make
thy burden intolerable.&mdash;5. Art at home? she'll scold thee out of
doors.&mdash;6. Art abroad? If thou be wise keep thee so, she'll perhaps graft
horns in thine absence, scowl on thee coming home.&mdash;7. Nothing gives more
content than solitariness, no solitariness like this of a single life,&mdash;8.
The band of marriage is adamantine, no hope of losing it, thou art
undone.&mdash;9. Thy number increaseth, thou shalt be devoured by thy wife's
friends.&mdash;10. Thou art made a cornuto by an unchaste wife, and shalt bring
up other folks' children instead of thine own.&mdash;11. Paul commends marriage,
yet he prefers a single life.&mdash;12. Is marriage honourable? What an immortal
crown belongs to virginity?

<p>So Siracides himself speaks as much as may be for and against women, so
doth almost every philosopher plead pro and con, every poet thus argues
the case (though what cares <span lang="la">vulgus nominum</span> what they say?): so can I
conceive peradventure, and so canst thou: when all is said, yet since some
be good, some bad, let's put it to the venture. I conclude therefore with
Seneca,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;cur Toro viduo jaces?</div>
<div class="line">Tristem juventam solve: mine luxus rape,</div>
<div class="line">Effunde habenas, optimos vitae dies</div>
<div class="line">Effluere prohibe.</div>
</div>
<q>Why dost thou lie alone, let thy youth and best days to pass away?</q> Marry
whilst thou mayst, <span lang="la">donec viventi canities abest morosa</span>, whilst thou art
yet able, yet lusty, <a href="#note5958">[5958]</a><span lang="la">Elige cui dicas, tu mihi sola places</span>, make
thy choice, and that freely forthwith, make no delay, but take thy fortune

be reconciled to the deity of this great god Love, go a pilgrimage to his

last to embrace marriage as the rest: There will not be found, I hope,

<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.3.1.1"></a>SUBSECT. I.&mdash;<i>Jealousy, its Equivocations, Name, Definition, Extent, several kinds; of Princes, Parents, Friends. In Beasts, Men: before marriage, as Co-rivals; or after, as in this place</i>.</h4>

<p>Valescus de Taranta <span class="cite">cap. de Melanchol.</span> Aelian Montaltus, Felix Platerus,
Guianerius, put jealousy for a cause of melancholy, others for a symptom;
because melancholy persons amongst these passions and perturbations of the
mind, are most obnoxious to it. But methinks for the latitude it hath, and
that prerogative above other ordinary symptoms, it ought to be treated of
as a species apart, being of so great and eminent note, so furious a
passion, and almost of as great extent as love itself, as <a href="#note5982">[5982]</a>Benedetto
Varchi holds, <q>no love without a mixture of jealousy,</q> <span lang="la">qui non zelat, non
amat</span>. For these causes I will dilate, and treat of it by itself, as a
bastard-branch or kind of love-melancholy, which, as heroical love goeth
commonly before marriage, doth usually follow, torture, and crucify in like
sort, deserves therefore to be rectified alike, requires as much care and
industry, in setting out the several causes of it, prognostics and cures.
Which I have more willingly done, that he that is or hath been jealous, may
see his error as in a glass; he that is not, may learn to detest, avoid it
himself, and dispossess others that are anywise affected with it.

<p>Jealousy is described and defined to be <a href="#note5983">[5983]</a><q>a certain suspicion which
the lover hath of the party he chiefly loveth, lest he or she should be
enamoured of another:</q> or any eager desire to enjoy some beauty alone, to
have it proper to himself only: a fear or doubt, lest any foreigner should
participate or share with him in his love. Or (as <a href="#note5984">[5984]</a>Scaliger adds) <q>a
fear of losing her favour whom he so earnestly affects.</q> Cardan calls it <q>a
<a href="#note5985">[5985]</a>zeal for love, and a kind of envy lest any man should beguile us.</q>
<a href="#note5986">[5986]</a>Ludovicus Vives defines it in the very same words, or little
differing in sense.

<p>There be many other jealousies, but improperly so called all; as that of
parents, tutors, guardians over their children, friends whom they love, or
such as are left to their wardship or protection.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note5987">[5987]</a>Storax non rediit hac nocte a coena Aeschinus,</div>
<div class="line">Neque servulorum quispiam qui adversum ierant?</div>
</div>
As the old man in the comedy cried out in a passion, and from a solicitous
fear and care he had of his adopted son; <a href="#note5988">[5988]</a><q>not of beauty, but lest
they should miscarry, do amiss, or any way discredit, disgrace</q> (as Vives
notes) <q>or endanger themselves and us.</q> <a href="#note5989">[5989]</a>Aegeus was so solicitous for
his son Theseus, (when he went to fight with the Minotaur) of his success,
lest he should be foiled, <a href="#note5990">[5990]</a><span lang="la">Prona est timori semper in pejus fides</span>.
We are still apt to suspect the worst in such doubtful cases, as many wives
in their husband's absence, fond mothers in their children's, lest if
absent they should be misled or sick, and are continually expecting news
from them, how they do fare, and what is become of them, they cannot endure
to have them long out of their sight: oh my sweet son, O my dear child, &amp;c.
Paul was jealous over the Church of Corinth, as he confesseth, <span class="bibcite">2 Cor. xi.
12.</span> <q>With a godly jealousy, to present them a pure virgin to Christ;</q> and
he was afraid still, lest as the serpent beguiled Eve, through his
subtlety, so their minds should be corrupt from the simplicity that is in
Christ. God himself, in some sense, is said to be jealous, <a href="#note5991">[5991]</a><q>I am a
jealous God, and will visit:</q> so <span class="bibcite">Psalm lxxix. 5.</span> <q>Shall thy jealousy burn
like fire for ever?</q> But these are improperly called jealousies, and by a
metaphor, to show the care and solicitude they have of them. Although some
jealousies express all the symptoms of this which we treat of, fear,
sorrow, anguish, anxiety, suspicion, hatred, &amp;c., the object only varied.
That of some fathers is very eminent, to their sons and heirs; for though
they love them dearly being children, yet now coming towards man's estate
they may not well abide them, the son and heir is commonly sick of the
father, and the father again may not well brook his eldest son, <span lang="la">inde
simultates, plerumque contentiones et inimicitiae</span>; but that of princes is
most notorious, as when they fear co-rivals (if I may so call them)
successors, emulators, subjects, or such as they have offended. <a href="#note5992">[5992]</a>
<span lang="la">Omnisque potestas impatiens consortis erit</span>: <q>they are still suspicious,
lest their authority should be diminished,</q> <a href="#note5993">[5993]</a>as one observes; and as
Comineus hath it, <a href="#note5994">[5994]</a><q>it cannot be expressed what slender causes they
have of their grief and suspicion, a secret disease, that commonly lurks
and breeds in princes' families.</q> Sometimes it is for their honour only, as
that of Adrian the emperor, <a href="#note5995">[5995]</a><q>that killed all his emulators.</q> Saul
envied David; Domitian Agricola, because he did excel him, obscure his
honour, as he thought, eclipse his fame. Juno turned Praetus' daughters into
kine, for that they contended with her for beauty; <a href="#note5996">[5996]</a>Cyparissae, king
Eteocles' children, were envied of the goddesses for their excellent good
parts, and dancing amongst the rest, saith <a href="#note5997">[5997]</a>Constantine, <q>and for
that cause flung headlong from heaven, and buried in a pit, but the earth
took pity of them, and brought out cypress trees to preserve their
memories.</q> <a href="#note5998">[5998]</a>Niobe, Arachne, and Marsyas, can testify as much. But it
is most grievous when it is for a kingdom itself, or matters of commodity,
it produceth lamentable effects, especially amongst tyrants, <span lang="la">in despotico
Imperio</span>, and such as are more feared than beloved of their subjects, that
get and keep their sovereignty by force and fear. <a href="#note5999">[5999]</a><span lang="la">Quod civibus
tenere te invitis scias</span>, &amp;c., as Phalaris, Dionysius, Periander held
theirs. For though fear, cowardice, and jealousy, in Plutarch's opinion, be
the common causes of tyranny, as in Nero, Caligula, Tiberius, yet most take
them to be symptoms. For <a href="#note6000">[6000]</a><q>what slave, what hangman</q> (as Bodine well
expresseth this passion, <span class="cite">l. 2. c. 5. de rep</span>.) <q>can so cruelly torture a
condemned person, as this fear and suspicion? Fear of death, infamy,
torments, are those furies and vultures that vex and disquiet tyrants, and
torture them day and night, with perpetual terrors and affrights, envy,
suspicion, fear, desire of revenge, and a thousand such disagreeing
perturbations, turn and affright the soul out of the hinges of health, and
more grievously wound and pierce, than those cruel masters can exasperate
and vex their apprentices or servants, with clubs, whips, chains, and
tortures.</q> Many terrible examples we have in this kind, amongst the Turks
especially, many jealous outrages; <a href="#note6001">[6001]</a>Selimus killed Kornutus his
youngest brother, five of his nephews, Mustapha Bassa, and divers others.
<a href="#note6002">[6002]</a>Bajazet the second Turk, jealous of the valour and greatness of
Achmet Bassa, caused him to be slain. <a href="#note6003">[6003]</a>Suleiman the Magnificent
murdered his own son Mustapha; and 'tis an ordinary thing amongst them, to
make away their brothers, or any competitors, at the first coming to the
crown: 'tis all the solemnity they use at their fathers' funerals. What mad
pranks in his jealous fury did Herod of old commit in Jewry, when he
massacred all the children of a year old? <a href="#note6004">[6004]</a>Valens the emperor in
Constantinople, when as he left no man alive of quality in his kingdom that
had his name begun with Theo; Theodoti, Theognosti, Theodosii, Theoduli,
&amp;c. They went all to their long home, because a wizard told him that name
should succeed in his empire. And what furious designs hath <a href="#note6005">[6005]</a>Jo.
Basilius, that Muscovian tyrant, practised of late? It is a wonder to read
that strange suspicion, which Suetonius reports of Claudius Caesar, and of
Domitian, they were afraid of every man they saw: and which Herodian of
Antoninus and Geta, those two jealous brothers, the one could not endure so
much as the other's servants, but made away him, his chiefest followers,
and all that belonged to him, or were his well-wishers. <a href="#note6006">[6006]</a>Maximinus
<q>perceiving himself to be odious to most men, because he was come to that
height of honour out of base beginnings, and suspecting his mean parentage
would be objected to him, caused all the senators that were nobly
descended, to be slain in a jealous humour, turned all the servants of
Alexander his predecessor out of doors, and slew many of them, because they
lamented their master's death, suspecting them to be traitors, for the love
they bare to him.</q> When Alexander in his fury had made Clitus his dear
friend to be put to death, and saw now (saith <a href="#note6007">[6007]</a>Curtius) an alienation
in his subjects' hearts, none durst talk with him, he began to be jealous
of himself, lest they should attempt as much on him, <q>and said they lived
like so many wild beasts in a wilderness, one afraid of another.</q> Our
modern stories afford us many notable examples. <a href="#note6008">[6008]</a>Henry the Third of
France, jealous of Henry of Lorraine, Duke of Guise, <i>anno</i> 1588, caused him
to be murdered in his own chamber. <a href="#note6009">[6009]</a>Louis the Eleventh was so
suspicious, he durst not trust his children, every man about him he
suspected for a traitor; many strange tricks Comineus telleth of him. How
jealous was our Henry the <a href="#note6010">[6010]</a>Fourth of King Richard the Second, so long
as he lived, after he was deposed? and of his own son Henry in his latter
days? which the prince well perceiving, came to visit his father in his
sickness, in a watchet velvet gown, full of eyelet holes, and with needles
sticking in them (as an emblem of jealousy), and so pacified his suspicious
father, after some speeches and protestations, which he had used to that
purpose. Perpetual imprisonment, as that of Robert <a href="#note6011">[6011]</a>Duke of Normandy,
in the days of Henry the First, forbidding of marriage to some persons,
with such like edicts and prohibitions, are ordinary in all states. In a
word (<a href="#note6012">[6012]</a>as he said) three things cause jealousy, a mighty state, a
rich treasure, a fair wife; or where there is a cracked title, much
tyranny, and exactions. In our state, as being freed from all these fears
and miseries, we may be most secure and happy under the reign of our
fortunate prince:
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6013">[6013]</a>His fortune hath indebted him to none</div>
<div class="line">But to all his people universally;</div>
<div class="line">And not to them but for their love alone,</div>
<div class="line">Which they account as placed worthily.</div>
<div class="line">He is so set, he hath no cause to be</div>
<div class="line">Jealous, or dreadful of disloyalty;</div>
<div class="line">The pedestal whereon his greatness stands.</div>
<div class="line">Is held of all our hearts, and all our hands.</div>
</div>
But I rove, I confess. These equivocations, jealousies, and many such,
which crucify the souls of men, are not here properly meant, or in this
distinction of ours included, but that alone which is for beauty, tending
to love, and wherein they can brook no co-rival, or endure any
participation: and this jealousy belongs as well to brute beasts, as men.
Some creatures, saith <a href="#note6014">[6014]</a>Vives, swans, doves, cocks, bulls, &amp;c., are
jealous as well as men, and as much moved, for fear of communion.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6015">[6015]</a>Grege pro toto bella juvenci,</div>

</div>
In bulls, horses, goats, this is most apparently discerned. Bulls
especially, <span lang="la">alium in pascuis non admittit</span>, he will not admit another bull
to feed in the same pasture, saith <a href="#note6016">[6016]</a>Oppin: which Stephanus Bathorius,
late king of Poland, used as an impress, with that motto, <span lang="la">Regnum non capit
duos</span>. R. T. in his Blazon of Jealousy, telleth a story of a swan about
Windsor, that finding a strange cock with his mate, did swim I know not how
many miles after to kill him, and when he had so done, came back and killed
his hen; a certain truth, he saith, done upon Thames, as many watermen, and
neighbour gentlemen, can tell. <span lang="la">Fidem suam liberet</span>; for my part, I do
believe it may be true; for swans have ever been branded with that epithet
of jealousy.

<div class="line"><a href="#note6017">[6017]</a>The jealous swanne against his death that singeth,</div>
<div class="line">And eke the owle that of death bode bringeth.</div>
</div>
<a href="#note6018">[6018]</a>Some say as much of elephants, that they are more jealous than any
other creatures whatsoever; and those old Egyptians, as <a href="#note6019">[6019]</a>Pierius
informeth us, express in their hieroglyphics, the passion of jealousy by a
camel; <a href="#note6020">[6020]</a>because that fearing the worst still about matters of venery,
he loves solitudes, that he may enjoy his pleasure alone, <span lang="la">et in quoscunque
obvios insurgit, Zelolypiae stimulis agitatus</span>, he will quarrel and fight
with whatsoever comes next, man or beast, in his jealous fits. I have read
as much of <a href="#note6021">[6021]</a>crocodiles; and if Peter Martyr's authority be authentic,
<span class="cite">legat. Babylonicae lib. 3.</span> you shall have a strange tale to that purpose
confidently related. Another story of the jealousy of dogs, see in Hieron.
Fabricius, <span class="cite">Tract. 3. cap. 5. de loquela animalium</span>.

<p>But this furious passion is most eminent in men, and is as well amongst
bachelors as married men. If it appear amongst bachelors, we commonly call
them rivals or co-rivals, a metaphor derived from a river, <span lang="la">rivales, a
<a href="#note6022">[6022]</a>rivo</span>; for as a river, saith Acron in Hor. <span class="cite">Art. Poet.</span> and Donat
in Ter. <span class="cite">Eunuch.</span> divides a common ground between two men, and both
participate of it, so is a woman indifferent between two suitors, both
likely to enjoy her; and thence comes this emulation, which breaks out many
times into tempestuous storms, and produceth lamentable effects, murder
itself, with much cruelty, many single combats. They cannot endure the
least injury done unto them before their mistress, and in her defence will
bite off one another's noses; they are most impatient of any flout,
disgrace, lest emulation or participation in that kind. <a href="#note6023">[6023]</a><span lang="la">Lacerat

story, <span class="cite">de oratore, lib. 2.</span>), being co-rival with Largus Terracina, bit

a proverb in those parts. <a href="#note6024">[6024]</a>Phaedria could not abide his co-rival
Thraso; for when Parmeno demanded, <span lang="la">numquid aliud imperas</span>? whether he
would command him any more service: <q>No more</q> (saith he) <q>but to speak in his
behalf, and to drive away his co-rival if he could.</q> Constantine, in the
eleventh book of his husbandry, <span class="cite">cap. 11</span>, hath a pleasant tale of the
pine-tree; <a href="#note6025">[6025]</a>she was once a fair maid, whom Pineus and Boreas, two
co-rivals, dearly sought; but jealous Boreas broke her neck, &amp;c. And in his
eighteenth chapter he telleth another tale of <a href="#note6026">[6026]</a>Mars, that in his
jealousy slew Adonis. Petronius calleth this passion <span lang="la">amantium furiosum
aemulationem</span>, a furious emulation; and their symptoms are well expressed
by Sir Geoffrey Chaucer in his first Canterbury Tale. It will make the
nearest and dearest friends fall out; they will endure all other things to
be common, goods, lands, moneys, participate of each pleasure, and take in
good part any disgraces, injuries in another kind; but as Propertius well
describes it in an elegy of his, in this they will suffer nothing, have no
co-rivals.

This jealousy, which I am to treat of, is that which belongs to married
men, in respect of their own wives; to whose estate, as no sweetness,
pleasure, happiness can be compared in the world, if they live quietly and
lovingly together; so if they disagree or be jealous, those bitter pills of
sorrow and grief, disastrous mischiefs, mischances, tortures, gripings,
discontents, are not to be separated from them. A most violent passion it
is where it taketh place, an unspeakable torment, a hellish torture, an
infernal plague, as Ariosto calls it, <q>a fury, a continual fever, full of
suspicion, fear, and sorrow, a martyrdom, a mirth-marring monster. The
sorrow and grief of heart of one woman jealous of another, is heavier than
death,</q> <span class="bibcite">Ecclus. xxviii. 6.</span> as <a href="#note6028">[6028]</a>Peninnah did Hannah, <q>vex her and
upbraid her sore.</q> 'Tis a main vexation, a most intolerable burden, a
corrosive to all content, a frenzy, a madness itself; as <a href="#note6029">[6029]</a>Beneditto
Varchi proves out of that select sonnet of Giovanni de la Casa, that
reverend lord, as he styles him.

<h4><a name="3.3.1.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Causes of Jealousy. Who are most apt. Idleness, melancholy, impotency, long absence, beauty, wantonness, naught themselves. Allurements, from time, place, persons, bad usage, causes</i>.</h4>

<p>Astrologers make the stars a cause or sign of this bitter passion, and out
of every man's horoscope will give a probable conjecture whether he will be
jealous or no, and at what time, by direction of the significators to their
several promissors: their aphorisms are to be read in Albubater, Pontanus,
Schoner, Junctine, &amp;c. Bodine, <span class="cite">cap. 5. meth. hist.</span> ascribes a great
cause to the country or clime, and discourseth largely there of this
subject, saying, that southern men are more hot, lascivious, and jealous,
than such as live in the north; they can hardly contain themselves in those
hotter climes, but are most subject to prodigious lust. Leo Afer telleth
incredible things almost, of the lust and jealousy of his countrymen of
Africa, and especially such as live about Carthage, and so doth every
geographer of them in <a href="#note6030">[6030]</a>Asia, Turkey, Spaniards, Italians. Germany
hath not so many drunkards, England tobacconists, France dancers, Holland
mariners, as Italy alone hath jealous husbands. And in <a href="#note6031">[6031]</a>Italy some
account them of Piacenza more jealous than the rest. In <a href="#note6032">[6032]</a>Germany,
France, Britain, Scandia, Poland, Muscovy, they are not so troubled with
this feral malady, although Damianus a Goes, which I do much wonder at, in
his topography of Lapland, and Herbastein of Russia, against the stream of
all other geographers, would fasten it upon those northern inhabitants.
Altomarius Poggius, and Munster in his description of Baden, reports that
men and women of all sorts go commonly into the baths together, without all
suspicion, <q>the name of jealousy</q> (saith Munster) <q>is not so much as once
heard of among them.</q> In Friesland the women kiss him they drink to, and
are kissed again of those they pledge. The virgins in Holland go hand in
hand with young men from home, glide on the ice, such is their harmless
liberty, and lodge together abroad without suspicion, which rash Sansovinus
an Italian makes a great sign of unchastity. In France, upon small
acquaintance, it is usual to court other men's wives, to come to their
houses, and accompany them arm in arm in the streets, without imputation.
In the most northern countries young men and maids familiarly dance
together, men and their wives, <a href="#note6033">[6033]</a>which, Siena only excepted, Italians
may not abide. The <a href="#note6034">[6034]</a>Greeks, on the other side, have their private
baths for men and women, where they must not come near, nor so much as see
one another: and as <a href="#note6035">[6035]</a>Bodine observes <span class="cite">lib. 5. de repub.</span> <q>the
Italians could never endure this,</q> or a Spaniard, the very conceit of it
would make him mad: and for that cause they lock up their women, and will
not suffer them to be near men, so much as in the <a href="#note6036">[6036]</a>church, but with a
partition between. He telleth, moreover, how that <q>when he was ambassador
in England, he heard Mendoza the Spanish legate finding fault with it, as a
filthy custom for men and women to sit promiscuously in churches together;
but Dr. Dale the master of the requests told him again, that it was indeed
a filthy custom in Spain, where they could not contain themselves from
lascivious thoughts in their holy places, but not with us.</q> Baronius in his
Annals, out of Eusebius, taxeth Licinius the emperor for a decree of his
made to this effect, <span lang="la">Jubens ne viri simul cum mulieribus in ecclesia
interessent</span>: for being prodigiously naught himself, <span lang="la">aliorum naturam ex
sua vitiosa mente spectavit</span>, he so esteemed others. But we are far from
any such strange conceits, and will permit our wives and daughters to go to
the tavern with a friend, as Aubanus saith, <span lang="la">modo absit lascivia</span>, and
suspect nothing, to kiss coming and going, which, as Erasmus writes in one
of his epistles, they cannot endure. England is a paradise for women, and
hell for horses: Italy a paradise for horses, hell for women, as the diverb
goes. Some make a question whether this headstrong passion rage more in
women than men, as Montaigne l. 3. But sure it is more outrageous in women,
as all other melancholy is, by reason of the weakness of their sex.
Scaliger <span class="cite">Poet. lib. cap. 13.</span> concludes against women: <a href="#note6037">[6037]</a><q>Besides
their inconstancy, treachery, suspicion, dissimulation, superstition,
pride,</q> (for all women are by nature proud) <q>desire of sovereignty, if they
be great women,</q> (he gives instance in Juno) <q>bitterness and jealousy are the
most remarkable affections.</q>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Sed neque fulvus aper media tam fulvus in ira est,</div>
<div class="line">Fulmineo rapidos dum rotat ore canes.</div>
<div class="line">Nec leo, &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Tiger, boar, bear, viper, lioness,</div>
<div class="line">A woman's fury cannot express.</div>
</div>
<a href="#note6038">[6038]</a>Some say redheaded women, pale-coloured, black-eyed, and of a
shrill voice, are most subject to jealousy.
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6039">[6039]</a>High colour in a woman choler shows,</div>
<div class="line">Naught are they, peevish, proud, malicious;</div>
<div class="line">But worst of all, red, shrill, and jealous.</div>
</div>
Comparisons are odious, I neither parallel them with others, nor debase
them any more: men and women are both bad, and too subject to this
pernicious infirmity. It is most part a symptom and cause of melancholy, as
Plater and Valescus teach us: melancholy men are apt to be jealous, and
jealous apt to be melancholy.
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Pale jealousy, child of insatiate love,</div>
<div class="line">Of heart-sick thoughts which melancholy bred,</div>
<div class="line">A hell-tormenting fear, no faith can move,</div>
<div class="line">By discontent with deadly poison fed;</div>
<div class="line">With heedless youth and error vainly led.</div>
<div class="line">A mortal plague, a virtue-drowning flood,</div>
<div class="line">A hellish fire not quenched but with blood.</div>
</div>
If idleness concur with melancholy, such persons are most apt to be
jealous; 'tis <a href="#note6040">[6040]</a>Nevisanus' note, <q>an idle woman is presumed to be
lascivious, and often jealous.</q> <span lang="la">Mulier cum sola cogitat, male cogitat</span>:
and 'tis not unlikely, for they have no other business to trouble their
heads with.

<p>More particular causes be these which follow. Impotency first, when a man
is not able of himself to perform those dues which he ought unto his wife:
for though he be an honest liver, hurt no man, yet Trebius the lawyer may
make a question, <span lang="la">an suum cuique tribuat</span>, whether he give every one their
own; and therefore when he takes notice of his wants, and perceives her to
be more craving, clamorous, insatiable and prone to lust than is fit, he
begins presently to suspect, that wherein he is defective, she will satisfy
herself, she will be pleased by some other means. Cornelius Gallus hath
elegantly expressed this humour in an epigram to his Lychoris.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="couplet">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6041">[6041]</a>Jamque alios juvenes aliosque requirit amores,</div>
<div class="line">Me vocat imbellem decrepitumque senem, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>
For this cause is most evident in old men, that are cold and dry by nature,
and married, <span lang="la">succi plenis</span>, to young wanton wives; with old doting Janivere
in Chaucer, they begin to mistrust all is not well,
<div class="blackletter">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;She was young and he was old,</div>
<div class="line">And therefore he feared to be a cuckold.</div>
</div>
And how should it otherwise be? old age is a disease of itself, loathsome,
full of suspicion and fear; when it is at best, unable, unfit for such
matters. <a href="#note6042">[6042]</a><span lang="la">Tam apta nuptiis quam bruma messibus</span>, as welcome to a
young woman as snow in harvest, saith Nevisanus: <span lang="la">Et si capis juvenculam,
faciet tibi cornua</span>: marry a lusty maid and she will surely graft horns on
thy head. <a href="#note6043">[6043]</a><q>All women are slippery, often unfaithful to their
husbands</q> (as Aeneas Sylvius <span class="cite">epist. 38.</span> seconds him), <q>but to old men most
treacherous:</q> they had rather <span lang="la">mortem amplexarier</span>, lie with a corse than
such a one: <a href="#note6044">[6044]</a><span lang="la">Oderunt illum pueri, contemnunt mulieres</span>. On the other
side many men, saith Hieronymus, are suspicious of their wives, <a href="#note6045">[6045]</a>if
they be lightly given, but old folks above the rest. Insomuch that she did
not complain without a cause in <a href="#note6046">[6046]</a>Apuleius, of an old bald bedridden
knave she had to her good man: <q>Poor woman as I am, what shall I do? I have
an old grim sire to my husband, as bald as a coot, as little and as unable
as a child,</q> a bedful of bones, <q>he keeps all the doors barred and locked
upon me, woe is me, what shall I do?</q> He was jealous, and she made him a
cuckold for keeping her up: suspicion without a cause, hard usage is able
of itself to make a woman fly out, that was otherwise honest,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6047">[6047]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;plerasque bonas tractatio pravas</div>
<div class="line">Esse facit,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
<q>bad usage aggravates the matter.</q> <span lang="la">Nam quando mulieres cognoscunt maritum
hoc advertere, licentius peccant</span>, <a href="#note6048">[6048]</a>as Nevisanus holds, when a woman
thinks her husband watcheth her, she will sooner offend; <a href="#note6049">[6049]</a><span lang="la">Liberius
peccant, et pudor omnis abest</span>, rough handling makes them worse: as the
goodwife of Bath in Chaucer brags,
<div class="blackletter">
<div class="line">In his own grease I made him frie</div>
<div class="line">For anger and for every jealousie.</div>
</div>
Of two extremes, this of hard usage is the worst. 'Tis a great fault (for
some men are <span lang="la">uxorii</span>) to be too fond of their wives, to dote on them as
<a href="#note6050">[6050]</a>Senior Deliro on his Fallace, to be too effeminate, or as some do,
to be sick for their wives, breed children for them, and like the <a href="#note6051">[6051]</a>
Tiberini lie in for them, as some birds hatch eggs by turns, they do all
women's offices: Caelius Rhodiginus <span class="cite">ant. lect. Lib. 6. cap. 24.</span> makes
mention of a fellow out of Seneca, <a href="#note6052">[6052]</a>that was so besotted on his wife,
he could not endure a moment out of her company, he wore her scarf when he
went abroad next his heart, and would never drink but in that cup she began
first. We have many such fondlings that are their wives' packhorses and
slaves, (<span lang="la">nam grave malum uxor superans virum suum</span>, as the comical poet
hath it, there's no greater misery to a man than to let his wife domineer)
to carry her muff, dog, and fan, let her wear the breeches, lay out, spend,
and do what she will, go and come whither, when she will, they give
consent.
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Here, take my muff, and, do you hear, good man;</div>
<div class="line">Now give me pearl, and carry you my fan, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6053">[6053]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;poscit pallam, redimicula, inaures;</div>

<div class="line">Tu pete lecticas&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
many brave and worthy men have trespassed in this kind, <span lang="la">multos foras
claros domestica haec destruxit infamia</span>, and many noble senators and
soldiers (as <a href="#note6054">[6054]</a>Pliny notes) have lost their honour, in being <span lang="la">uxorii</span>,
so sottishly overruled by their wives; and therefore Cato in Plutarch made
a bitter jest on his fellow-citizens, the Romans, <q>we govern all the world
abroad, and our wives at home rule us.</q> These offend in one extreme; but
too hard and too severe, are far more offensive on the other. <a name="index2"></a>As just a
cause may be long absence of either party, when they must of necessity be
much from home, as lawyers, physicians, mariners, by their professions; or
otherwise make frivolous, impertinent journeys, tarry long abroad to no
purpose, lie out, and are gadding still, upon small occasions, it must
needs yield matter of suspicion, when they use their wives unkindly in the
meantime, and never tarry at home, it cannot use but engender some such
conceit.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6055">[6055]</a>Uxor si cessas amare te cogitat</div>
<div class="line">Aut tote amari, aut potare, aut animo obsequi,</div>

</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">If thou be absent long, thy wife then thinks,</div>
<div class="line">Th' art drunk, at ease, or with some pretty minx,</div>
<div class="line">'Tis well with thee, or else beloved of some,</div>
<div class="line">Whilst she poor soul doth fare full ill at home.</div>
</div>
Hippocrates, the physician, had a smack of this disease; for when he was to
go home as far as Abdera, and some other remote cities of Greece, he writ
to his friend Dionysius (if at least those <a href="#note6056">[6056]</a>Epistles be his) <a href="#note6057">[6057]</a>
<q>to oversee his wife in his absence, (as Apollo set a raven to watch his
Coronis) although she lived in his house with her father and mother, who be
knew would have a care of her; yet that would not satisfy his jealousy, he
would have his special friend Dionysius to dwell in his house with her all
the time of his peregrination, and to observe her behaviour, how she
carried herself in her husband's absence, and that she did not lust after
other men. <a href="#note6058">[6058]</a>For a woman had need to have an overseer to keep her
honest; they are bad by nature, and lightly given all, and if they be not
curbed in time, as an unpruned tree, they will be full of wild branches,
and degenerate of a sudden.</q> Especially in their husband's absence: though
one Lucretia were trusty, and one Penelope, yet Clytemnestra made Agamemnon
cuckold; and no question there be too many of her conditions. If their
husbands tarry too long abroad upon unnecessary business, well they may
suspect: or if they run one way, their wives at home will fly out another,
<span lang="la">quid pro quo</span>. Or if present, and give them not that content which they
ought, <a href="#note6059">[6059]</a><span lang="la">Primum ingratae, mox invisae noctes quae per somnum
transiguntur</span>, they cannot endure to lie alone, or to fast long. <a href="#note6060">[6060]</a>
Peter Godefridus, in his second book of Love, and sixth chapter, hath a
story out of St. Anthony's life, of a gentleman, who, by that good man's
advice, would not meddle with his wife in the passion week, but for his
pains she set a pair of horns on his head. Such another he hath out of
Abstemius, one persuaded a new married man, <a href="#note6061">[6061]</a><q>to forbear the three
first nights, and he should all his lifetime after be fortunate in cattle,</q>
but his impatient wife would not tarry so long: well he might speed in
cattle, but not in children. Such a tale hath Heinsius of an impotent and
slack scholar, a mere student, and a friend of his, that seeing by chance a
fine damsel sing and dance, would needs marry her, the match was soon made,
for he was young and rich, <span lang="la">genis gratus, corpore glabellus, arte
multiscius, et fortuna opulentus</span>, like that Apollo in <a href="#note6062">[6062]</a>Apuleius. The
first night, having liberally taken his liquor (as in that country they do)
my fine scholar was so fuzzled, that he no sooner was laid in bed, but he
fell fast asleep, never waked till morning, and then much abashed,
<span lang="la">purpureis formosa rosis cum Aurora ruberet</span>; when the fair morn with
purple hue 'gan shine, he made an excuse, I know not what, out of
Hippocrates Cous, &amp;c., and for that time it went current: but when as
afterward he did not play the man as he should do, she fell in league with
a good fellow, and whilst he sat up late at his study about those
criticisms, mending some hard places in Festus or Pollux, came cold to bed,
and would tell her still what he had done, she did not much regard what he
said, &amp;c. <a href="#note6063">[6063]</a><q>She would have another matter mended much rather, which
he did not conceive was corrupt:</q> thus he continued at his study late, she
at her sport, <span lang="la">alibi enim festivas noctes agitabat</span>, hating all scholars
for his sake, till at length he began to suspect, and turned a little
yellow, as well he might; for it was his own fault; and if men be jealous
in such cases (<a href="#note6064">[6064]</a>as oft it falls out) the mends is in their own hands,
they must thank themselves. Who will pity them, saith Neander, or be much
offended with such wives, <span lang="la">si deceptae prius viros decipiant, et cornutos
reddant</span>, if they deceive those that cozened them first. A lawyer's wife in
<a href="#note6065">[6065]</a>Aristaenetus, because her husband was negligent in his business,
<span lang="la">quando lecto danda opera</span>, threatened to cornute him: and did not stick to
tell Philinna, one of her gossips, as much, and that aloud for him to hear:
<q>If he follow other men's matters and leave his own, I'll have an orator
shall plead my cause,</q> I care not if he know it.

<p>A fourth eminent cause of jealousy may be this, when he that is deformed,
and as Pindarus of Vulcan, <span lang="la">sine gratiis natus</span>, hirsute, ragged, yet
virtuously given, will marry some fair nice piece, or light housewife,
begins to misdoubt (as well he may) she doth not affect him. <a href="#note6066">[6066]</a><span lang="la">Lis
est cum forma magna pudicitiae</span>, beauty and honesty have ever been at odds.
Abraham was jealous of his wife because she was fair: so was Vulcan of his
Venus, when he made her creaking shoes, saith <a href="#note6067">[6067]</a>Philostratus, <span lang="la">ne
maecharetur, sandalio scilicet deferente</span>, that he might hear by them when
she stirred, which <span lang="la">Mars indigne ferre</span>, <a href="#note6068">[6068]</a>was not well pleased with.
Good cause had Vulcan to do as he did, for she was no honester than she
should be. Your fine faces have commonly this fault; and it is hard to
find, saith Francis Philelphus in an epistle to Saxola his friend, a rich
man honest, a proper woman not proud or unchaste. <q>Can she be fair and
honest too?</q>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6069">[6069]</a>Saepe etenim oculuit picta sese hydra sub herba,</div>
<div class="line">Sub specie formae, incauto se saepe marito</div>
<div class="line">Nequam animus vendit,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
He that marries a wife that is snowy fair alone, let him look, saith <a href="#note6070">[6070]</a>
Barbarus, for no better success than Vulcan had with Venus, or Claudius
with Messalina. And 'tis impossible almost in such cases the wife should
contain, or the good man not be jealous: for when he is so defective, weak,
ill-proportioned, unpleasing in those parts which women most affect, and
she most absolutely fair and able on the other side, if she be not very
virtuously given, how can she love him? and although she be not fair, yet
if he admire her and think her so, in his conceit she is absolute, he holds
it impossible for any man living not to dote as he doth, to look on her and
not lust, not to covet, and if he be in company with her, not to lay siege
to her honesty: or else out of a deep apprehension of his infirmities,
deformities, and other men's good parts, out of his own little worth and
desert, he distrusts himself, (for what is jealousy but distrust?) he
suspects she cannot affect him, or be not so kind and loving as she should,
she certainly loves some other man better than himself.

<p><a href="#note6071">[6071]</a>Nevisanus, <span class="cite">lib. 4. num. 72</span>, will have barrenness to be a main
cause of jealousy. If her husband cannot play the man, some other shall,
they will leave no remedies unessayed, and thereupon the good man grows
jealous; I could give an instance, but be it as it is.

<p>I find this reason given by some men, because they have been formerly
naught themselves, they think they may be so served by others, they turned
up trump before the cards were shuffled; they shall have therefore <span lang="la">legem
talionis</span>, like for like.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6072">[6072]</a>Ipse miser docui, quo posset ludere pacto</div>
<div class="line">Custodes, eheu nunc premor arte mea.</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Wretch as I was, I taught her bad to be,</div>
<div class="line">And now mine own sly tricks are put upon me.</div>
</div>
<span lang="la">Mala mens, malus animus</span>, as the saying is, ill dispositions cause ill
suspicions.
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6073">[6073]</a>There is none jealous, I durst pawn my life,</div>
<div class="line">But he that hath defiled another's wife,</div>
<div class="line">And for that he himself hath gone astray,</div>
<div class="line">He straightway thinks his wife will tread that way.</div>
</div>
To these two above-named causes, or incendiaries of this rage, I may very
well annex those circumstances of time, place, persons, by which it ebbs
and flows, the fuel of this fury, as <a href="#note6074">[6074]</a>Vives truly observes; and such
like accidents or occasions, proceeding from the parties themselves, or
others, which much aggravate and intend this suspicious humour. For many
men are so lasciviously given, either out of a depraved nature, or too much
liberty, which they do assume unto themselves, by reason of their
greatness, in that they are noble men, (for <span lang="la">licentiae peccandi, et
multitudo peccantium</span> are great motives) though their own wives be never so
fair, noble, virtuous, honest, wise, able, and well given, they must have

<span lang="la">Quod licet ingratum est</span>, that which is ordinary, is unpleasant. Nero
(saith Tacitus) abhorred Octavia his own wife, a noble virtuous lady, and

Vitellius the emperor was wont to say, <span lang="la">Jucundiores amores, qui cum
periculo habentur</span>, like stolen venison, still the sweetest is that love

their own.

Or that some fair object so forcibly moves them, they cannot contain
themselves, be it heard or seen they will be at it. <a href="#note6079">[6079]</a>Nessus, the
centaur, was by agreement to carry Hercules and his wife over the river
Evenus; no sooner had he set Dejanira on the other side, but he would have
offered violence unto her, leaving Hercules to swim over as he could: and
though her husband was a spectator, yet would he not desist till Hercules,
with a poisoned arrow, shot him to death. <a href="#note6080">[6080]</a>Neptune saw by chance that
Thessalian Tyro, Eunippius' wife, he forthwith, in the fury of his lust,
counterfeited her husband's habit, and made him cuckold. Tarquin heard
Collatine commend his wife, and was so far enraged, that in the midst of
the night to her he went. <a href="#note6081">[6081]</a>Theseus stole Ariadne, <span lang="la">vi rapuit</span> that
Trazenian Anaxa, Antiope, and now being old, Helen, a girl not yet ready
for a husband. Great men are most part thus affected all, <q>as a horse they
neigh,</q> saith <a href="#note6082">[6082]</a>Jeremiah, after their neighbours' wives,&mdash;<span lang="la">ut visa

in their own wives' presence, they must be courting and dallying with them.
Juno in Lucian complains of Jupiter that he was still kissing Ganymede
before her face, which did not a little offend her: and besides he was a
counterfeit Amphitryo, a bull, a swan, a golden shower, and played many
such bad pranks, too long, too shameful to relate.

<p>Or that they care little for their own ladies, and fear no laws, they dare
freely keep whores at their wives' noses. 'Tis too frequent with noblemen
to be dishonest; <span lang="la">Pielas, probitas, fides, privata bona sunt</span>, as <a href="#note6083">[6083]</a>he
said long since, piety, chastity, and such like virtues are for private
men: not to be much looked after in great courts: and which Suetonius of
the good princes of his time, they might be all engraven in one ring, we
may truly hold of chaste potentates of our age. For great personages will
familiarly run out in this kind, and yield occasion of offence. <a href="#note6084">[6084]</a>
Montaigne, in his Essays, gives instate in Caesar, Mahomet the Turk, that
sacked Constantinople, and Ladislaus, king of Naples, that besieged
Florence: great men, and great soldiers, are commonly great, &amp;c., <span lang="la">probatum
est</span>, they are good doers. Mars and Venus are equally balanced in their
actions,

Especially if they be bald, for bald men have ever been suspicious (read
more in Aristotle, <span class="cite">Sect. 4. prob. 19.</span>) as Galba, Otho, Domitian, and
remarkable Caesar amongst the rest. <a href="#note6086">[6086]</a><span lang="la">Urbani servate uxores, maechum
calvum adducimus</span>; besides, this bald Caesar, saith Curio in Sueton, was
<span lang="la">omnium mulierum vir</span>; he made love to Eunoe, queen of Mauritania; to
Cleopatra; to Posthumia, wife to Sergius Sulpitius; to Lollia, wife to
Gabinius; to Tertulla, of Crassus; to Mutia, Pompey's wife, and I know not
how many besides: and well he might, for, if all be true that I have read,
he had a license to lie with whom he list. <span lang="la">Inter alios honores Caesari
decretos</span> (as Sueton, <span class="cite">cap. 52. de Julio</span>, and Dion, <span class="cite">lib. 44.</span> relate)
<span lang="la">jus illi datum, cum quibuscunque faeminis se jungendi</span>. Every private
history will yield such variety of instances: otherwise good, wise,
discreet men, virtuous and valiant, but too faulty in this. Priamus had
fifty sons, but seventeen alone lawfully begotten. <a href="#note6087">[6087]</a>Philippus Bonus
left fourteen bastards. Lorenzo de Medici, a good prince and a wise, but,
saith Machiavel, <a href="#note6088">[6088]</a>prodigiously lascivious. None so valiant as
Castruccius Castrucanus, but, as the said author hath it, <a href="#note6089">[6089]</a>none so
incontinent as he was. And 'tis not only predominant in grandees this
fault: but if you will take a great man's testimony, 'tis familiar with
every base soldier in France, (and elsewhere, I think). <q>This vice</q> (<a href="#note6090">[6090]</a>
saith mine author) <q>is so common with us in France, that he is of no
account, a mere coward, not worthy the name of a soldier, that is not a
notorious whoremaster.</q> In Italy he is not a gentleman, that besides his
wife hath not a courtesan and a mistress. 'Tis no marvel, then, if poor
women in such cases be jealous, when they shall see themselves manifestly
neglected, contemned, loathed, unkindly used: their disloyal husbands to
entertain others in their rooms, and many times to court ladies to their
faces: other men's wives to wear their jewels: how shall a poor woman in
such a case moderate her passion? <a href="#note6091">[6091]</a><span lang="la">Quis tibi nunc Dido cernenti
talia sensus</span>?

<p>How, on the other side, shall a poor man contain himself from this feral
malady, when he shall see so manifest signs of his wife's inconstancy?
when, as Milo's wife, she dotes upon every young man she sees, or, as
<a href="#note6092">[6092]</a>Martial's Sota,&mdash;<span lang="la">deserto sequitur Clitum marito</span>, <q>deserts her
husband and follows Clitus.</q> Though her husband be proper and tall, fair
and lovely to behold, able to give contentment to any one woman, yet she
will taste of the forbidden fruit: Juvenal's Iberina to a hair, she is as
well pleased with one eye as one man. If a young gallant come by chance
into her presence, a fastidious brisk, that can wear his clothes well in
fashion, with a lock, jingling spur, a feather, that can cringe, and withal
compliment, court a gentlewoman, she raves upon him, <q>O what a lovely
proper man he was,</q> another Hector, an Alexander, a goodly man, a demigod,
how sweetly he carried himself, with how comely a grace, <span lang="la">sic oculos, sic
ille manus, sic ora ferebat</span>, how neatly he did wear his clothes! <a href="#note6093">[6093]</a>
<span lang="la">Quam sese ore ferens, quam forti pectore et armis</span>, how bravely did he
discourse, ride, sing, and dance, &amp;c., and then she begins to loathe her
husband, <span lang="la">repugnans osculatur</span>, to hate him and his filthy beard, his
goatish complexion, as Doris said of Polyphemus, <a href="#note6094">[6094]</a><span lang="la">totus qui saniem,
totus ut hircus olet</span>, he is a rammy fulsome fellow, a goblin-faced fellow,
he smells, he stinks, <span lang="la">Et caepas simul alliumque ructat</span> <a href="#note6095">[6095]</a>&mdash;<span lang="la">si quando
ad thalamum</span>, &amp;c., how like a dizzard, a fool, an ass, he looks, how like a
clown he behaves himself! <a href="#note6096">[6096]</a>she will not come near him by her own good
will, but wholly rejects him, as Venus did her fuliginous Vulcan, at last,
<span lang="la">Nec Deus hunc mensa, Dea nec dignata cubili est</span>. <a href="#note6097">[6097]</a>So did Lucretia, a
lady of Senae, after she had but seen Euryalus, <span lang="la">in Eurialum tota ferebatur,
domum reversa</span>, &amp;c., she would not hold her eyes off him in his presence,&mdash;
<a href="#note6098">[6098]</a><span lang="la">tantum egregio decus enitet ore</span>, and in his absence could think of
none but him, <span lang="la">odit virum</span>, she loathed her husband forthwith, might not
abide him:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6099">[6099]</a>Et conjugalis negligens tori, viro</div>
<div class="line">Praesente, acerbo nauseat fastidio;</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">All against the laws of matrimony,</div>
<div class="line">She did abhor her husband's phis'nomy;</div>
</div>
and sought all opportunity to see her sweetheart again. Now when the good
man shall observe his wife so lightly given, <q>to be so free and familiar
with every gallant, her immodesty and wantonness,</q> (as <a href="#note6100">[6100]</a>Camerarius
notes) it must needs yield matter of suspicion to him, when she still
pranks up herself beyond her means and fortunes, makes impertinent
journeys, unnecessary visitations, stays out so long, with such and such
companions, so frequently goes to plays, masks, feasts, and all public
meetings, shall use such immodest <a href="#note6101">[6101]</a>gestures, free speeches, and
withal show some distaste of her own husband; how can he choose, <q>though he
were another Socrates, but be suspicious, and instantly jealous?</q> <a href="#note6102">[6102]</a>
<span lang="la">Socraticas tandem faciet transcendere metas</span>; more especially when he
shall take notice of their more secret and sly tricks, which to cornute
their husbands they commonly use (<span lang="la">dum ludis, ludos haec te facit</span>) they
pretend love, honour, chastity, and seem to respect them before all men
living, saints in show, so cunningly can they dissemble, they will not so
much as look upon another man in his presence, <a href="#note6103">[6103]</a>so chaste, so
religious, and so devout, they cannot endure the name or sight of a quean,
a harlot, out upon her! and in their outward carriage are most loving and
officious, will kiss their husband, and hang about his neck (dear husband,
sweet husband), and with a composed countenance salute him, especially when
he comes home; or if he go from home, weep, sigh, lament, and take upon
them to be sick and swoon (like Jocundo's wife in <a href="#note6104">[6104]</a>Ariosto, when her
husband was to depart), and yet arrant, &amp;c. they care not for him,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Aye me, the thought (quoth she) makes me so 'fraid,</div>
<div class="line">That scarce the breath abideth in my breast;</div>
<div class="line">Peace, my sweet love and wife, Jocundo said,</div>
<div class="line">And weeps as fast, and comforts her his best, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line">All this might not assuage the woman's pain,</div>
<div class="line">Needs must I die before you come again,</div>
<div class="line">Nor how to keep my life I can devise,</div>
<div class="line">The doleful days and nights I shall sustain,</div>
<div class="line">From meat my mouth, from sleep will keep mine eyes, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line">That very night that went before the morrow,</div>
<div class="line">That he had pointed surely to depart,</div>
<div class="line">Jocundo's wife was sick, and swoon'd for sorrow</div>
<div class="line">Amid his arms, so heavy was her heart.</div>
</div>
And yet for all these counterfeit tears and protestations, Jocundo coming
back in all haste for a jewel he had forgot,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">His chaste and yoke-fellow he found</div>
<div class="line">Yok'd with a knave, all honesty neglected,</div>
<div class="line">The adulterer sleeping very sound,</div>
<div class="line">Yet by his face was easily detected:</div>
<div class="line">A beggar's brat bred by him from his cradle.,</div>
<div class="line">And now was riding on his master's saddle.</div>
</div>
Thus can they cunningly counterfeit, as <a href="#note6105">[6105]</a>Platina describes their
customs, <q>kiss their husbands, whom they had rather see hanging on a
gallows, and swear they love him dearer than their own lives, whose soul
they would not ransom for their little dog's,</q>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;similis si permutatio detur,</div>
<div class="line">Morte viri cupiunt aniniani servare catellae.</div>
</div>
Many of them seem to be precise and holy forsooth, and will go to such a
<a href="#note6106">[6106]</a>church, to hear such a good man by all means, an excellent man, when
'tis for no other intent (as he follows it) than <q>to see and to be seen, to
observe what fashions are in use, to meet some pander, bawd, monk, friar,
or to entice some good fellow.</q> For they persuade themselves, as <a href="#note6107">[6107]</a>
Nevisanus shows, <q>That it is neither sin nor shame to lie with a lord or
parish priest, if he be a proper man;</q> <a href="#note6108">[6108]</a><q>and though she kneel often,
and pray devoutly, 'tis</q> (saith Platina) <q>not for her husband's welfare, or
children's good, or any friend, but for her sweetheart's return, her
pander's health.</q> If her husband would have her go, she feigns herself
sick, <a href="#note6109">[6109]</a><span lang="la">Et simulat subito condoluisse caput</span>: her head aches, and she
cannot stir: but if her paramour ask as much, she is for him in all
seasons, at all hours of the night. <a href="#note6110">[6110]</a>In the kingdom of Malabar, and
about Goa in the East Indies, the women are so subtile that, with a certain
drink they give them to drive away cares as they say, <a href="#note6111">[6111]</a><q>they will
make them sleep for twenty-four hours, or so intoxicate them that they can
remember nought of that they saw done, or heard, and, by washing of their
feet, restore them again, and so make their husbands cuckolds to their
faces.</q> Some are ill-disposed at all times, to all persons they like,
others more wary to some few, at such and such seasons, as Augusta, Livia,
<span lang="la">non nisi plena navi vectorem tollebat</span>. But as he said,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6112">[6112]</a>No pen could write, no tongue attain to tell,</div>
<div class="line">By force of eloquence, or help of art,</div>
<div class="line">Of women's treacheries the hundredth part.</div>
</div>
Both, to say truth, are often faulty; men and women give just occasions in
this humour of discontent, aggravate and yield matter of suspicion: but
most part of the chief causes proceed from other adventitious accidents and
circumstances, though the parties be free, and both well given themselves.
The indiscreet carriage of some lascivious gallant (<span lang="la">et e contra</span> of some
light woman) by his often frequenting of a house, bold unseemly gestures,
may make a breach, and by his over-familiarity, if he be inclined to
yellowness, colour him quite out. If he be poor, basely born, saith
Beneditto Varchi, and otherwise unhandsome, he suspects him the less; but
if a proper man, such as was Alcibiades in Greece, and Castruccius
Castrucanus in Italy, well descended, commendable for his good parts, he
taketh on the more, and watcheth his doings. <a href="#note6113">[6113]</a>Theodosius the emperor
gave his wife Eudoxia a golden apple when he was a suitor to her, which she
long after bestowed upon a young gallant in the court, of her especial
acquaintance. The emperor, espying this apple in his hand, suspected
forthwith, more than was, his wife's dishonesty, banished him the court,
and from that day following forbare to accompany her any more. <a href="#note6114">[6114]</a>A
rich merchant had a fair wife; according to his custom he went to travel;
in his absence a good fellow tempted his wife; she denied him; yet he,
dying a little after, gave her a legacy for the love he bore her. At his
return, her jealous husband, because she had got more by land than he had
done at sea, turned her away upon suspicion.

<p>Now when those other circumstances of time and place, opportunity and
importunity shall concur, what will they not effect?
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Fair opportunity can win the coyest she that is,</div>
<div class="line">So wisely he takes time, as he'll be sure he will not miss:</div>
<div class="line">Then lie that loves her gamesome vein, and tempers toys with art,</div>
<div class="line">Brings love that swimmeth in her eyes to dive into her heart.</div>
</div>
As at plays, masks, great feasts and banquets, one singles out his wife to
dance, another courts her in his presence, a third tempts her, a fourth
insinuates with a pleasing compliment, a sweet smile, ingratiates himself
with an amphibological speech, as that merry companion in the <a href="#note6115">[6115]</a>
Satirist did to his Glycerium, <a href="#note6116">[6116]</a><span lang="la">adsidens et interiorem palmam

<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Quod meus hortus habet sumat impune licebit,</div>

</div>
with many such, &amp;c., and then as he saith,
<div class="blackletter">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6117">[6117]</a>She may no while in chastity abide.</div>
<div class="line">That is assaid on every side.</div>
</div>
For after al great feast, <a href="#note6118">[6118]</a><span lang="la">Vino saepe suum nescit amica virum</span>. Noah
(saith <a href="#note6119">[6119]</a>Hierome) <q>showed his nakedness in his drunkenness, which for
six hundred years he had covered in soberness.</q> Lot lay with his daughters
in his drink, as Cyneras with Myrrha,&mdash;<a href="#note6120">[6120]</a><span lang="la">quid enim Venus ebria
curat</span>? The most continent may be overcome, or if otherwise they keep bad
company, they that are modest of themselves, and dare not offend,
<q>confirmed by <a href="#note6121">[6121]</a>others, grow impudent, and confident, and get an ill
habit.</q>

Or if they dwell in suspected places, as in an infamous inn, near some
stews, near monks, friars, Nevisanus adds, where be many tempters and
solicitors, idle persons that frequent their companies, it may give just
cause of suspicion. Martial of old inveighed against them that
counterfeited a disease to go to the bath; for so, many times,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;relicto</div>
<div class="line">Conjuge Penelope venit, abit Helene.</div>

Aeneas Sylvius puts in a caveat against princes' courts, because there be
<span lang="la">tot formosi juvenes qui promittunt</span>, so many brave suitors to tempt, &amp;c.
<a href="#note6123">[6123]</a><q>If you leave her in such a place, you shall likely find her in
company you like not, either they come to her, or she is gone to them.</q>
<a href="#note6124">[6124]</a>Kornmannus makes a doubting jest in his lascivious country,
<span lang="la">Virginis illibata censeatur ne castitas ad quam frequentur accedant
scholares</span>? And Baldus the lawyer scoffs on, <span lang="la">quum scholaris, inquit,
loquitur cum puella, non praesumitur ei dicere, Pater noster</span>, when a
scholar talks with a maid, or another man's wife in private, it is presumed
he saith not a <span lang="la">pater noster</span>. Or if I shall see a monk or a friar climb up
a ladder at midnight into a virgin's or widow's chamber window, I shall
hardly think he then goes to administer the sacraments, or to take her
confession. These are the ordinary causes of jealousy, which are intended
or remitted as the circumstances vary.

<h3><a name="3.3.2"></a>MEMB. II.</h3>
<h4><i>Symptoms of Jealousy, Fear, Sorrow, Suspicion, strange Actions, Gestures, Outrages, Locking up, Oaths, Trials, Laws, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Of all passions, as I have already proved, love is most violent, and of
those bitter potions which this love-melancholy affords, this bastard
jealousy is the greatest, as appears by those prodigious symptoms which it
hath, and that it produceth. For besides fear and sorrow, which is common
to all melancholy, anxiety of mind, suspicion, aggravation, restless
thoughts, paleness, meagreness, neglect of business, and the like, these
men are farther yet misaffected, and in a higher strain. 'Tis a more
vehement passion, a more furious perturbation, a bitter pain, a fire, a
pernicious curiosity, a gall corrupting the honey of our life, madness,
vertigo, plague, hell, they are more than ordinarily disquieted, they lose
<span lang="la">bonum pacis</span>, as <a href="#note6125">[6125]</a>Chrysostom observes; and though they be rich, keep
sumptuous tables, be nobly allied, yet <span lang="la">miserrimi omnium sunt</span>, they are
most miserable, they are more than ordinarily discontent, more sad, <span lang="la">nihil
tristius</span>, more than ordinarily suspicious. Jealousy, saith <a href="#note6126">[6126]</a>Vives,
<q>begets unquietness in the mind, night and day: he hunts after every word
he hears, every whisper, and amplifies it to himself</q> (as all melancholy men
do in other matters) <q>with a most unjust calumny of others, he misinterprets
everything is said or done, most apt to mistake or misconstrue,</q> he pries
into every corner, follows close, observes to a hair. 'Tis proper to
jealousy so to do,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Pale hag, infernal fury, pleasure's smart,</div>
<div class="line">Envy's observer, prying in every part.</div>
</div>
Besides those strange gestures of staring, frowning, grinning, rolling of
eyes, menacing, ghastly looks, broken pace, interrupt, precipitate,
half-turns. He will sometimes sigh, weep, sob for anger. <span lang="la">Nempe suos imbres
etiam ista tonitrua fundunt</span>,<a href="#note6127">[6127]</a>&mdash;swear and belie, slander any man,
curse, threaten, brawl, scold, fight; and sometimes again flatter and speak
fair, ask forgiveness, kiss and coll, condemn his rashness and folly, vow,
protest, and swear he will never do so again; and then eftsoons, impatient
as he is, rave, roar, and lay about him like a madman, thump her sides,
drag her about perchance, drive her out of doors, send her home, he will be
divorced forthwith, she is a whore, &amp;c., and by-and-by with all submission
compliment, entreat her fair, and bring her in again, he loves her dearly,
she is his sweet, most kind and loving wife, he will not change, nor leave
her for a kingdom; so he continues off and on, as the toy takes him, the
object moves him, but most part brawling, fretting, unquiet he is, accusing
and suspecting not strangers only, but brothers and sisters, father and
mother, nearest and dearest friends. He thinks with those Italians,
<div class="poem" lang="it">
<div class="line">Chi non tocca parentado,</div>
<div class="line">Tocca mai e rado.</div>
</div>
And through fear conceives unto himself things almost incredible and
impossible to be effected. As a heron when she fishes, still prying on all
sides; or as a cat doth a mouse, his eye is never off hers; he gloats on
him, on her, accurately observing on whom she looks, who looks at her, what
she saith, doth, at dinner, at supper, sitting, walking, at home, abroad,
he is the same, still inquiring, maundering, gazing, listening, affrighted
with every small object; why did she smile, why did she pity him, commend
him? why did she drink twice to such a man? why did she offer to kiss, to
dance? &amp;c., a whore, a whore, an arrant whore. All this he confesseth in
the poet,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6128">[6128]</a>Omnia me terrent, timidus sum, ignosce timori.</div>
<div class="line">Et miser in tunica suspicor esse virum.</div>

<div class="line">Me soror, et cum qua dormit amica simul.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Each thing affrights me, I do fear,</div>
<div class="line">Ah pardon me my fear,</div>
<div class="line">I doubt a man is hid within</div>
<div class="line">The clothes that thou dost wear.</div>
</div>
Is it not a man in woman's apparel? is not somebody in that great chest, or
behind the door, or hangings, or in some of those barrels? may not a man
steal in at the window with a ladder of ropes, or come down the chimney,
have a false key, or get in when he is asleep? If a mouse do but stir, or
the wind blow, a casement clatter, that's the villain, there he is: by his
goodwill no man shall see her, salute her, speak with her, she shall not
go forth of his sight, so much as to do her needs. <a href="#note6129">[6129]</a><span lang="la">Non ita bovem
argus</span>, &amp;c. Argus did not so keep his cow, that watchful dragon the golden
fleece, or Cerberus the coming in of hell, as he keeps his wife. If a dear
friend or near kinsman come as guest to his house, to visit him, he will
never let him be out of his own sight and company, lest, peradventure, &amp;c.
If the necessity of his business be such that he must go from home, he doth
either lock her up, or commit her with a deal of injunctions and
protestations to some trusty friends, him and her he sets and bribes to
oversee: one servant is set in his absence to watch another, and all to
observe his wife, and yet all this will not serve, though his business be
very urgent, he will when he is halfway come back in all post haste, rise
from supper, or at midnight, and be gone, and sometimes leave his business
undone, and as a stranger court his own wife in some disguised habit.
Though there be no danger at all, no cause of suspicion, she live in such a
place, where Messalina herself could not be dishonest if she would, yet he
suspects her as much as if she were in a bawdy-house, some prince's court,
or in a common inn, where all comers might have free access. He calls her
on a sudden all to nought, she is a strumpet, a light housewife, a bitch,
an arrant whore. No persuasion, no protestation can divert this passion,
nothing can ease him, secure or give him satisfaction. It is most strange
to report what outrageous acts by men and women have been committed in this
kind, by women especially, that will run after their husbands into all
places and companies, <a href="#note6130">[6130]</a>as Jovianus Pontanus's wife did by him, follow
him whithersoever he went, it matters not, or upon what business, raving
like Juno in the tragedy, miscalling, cursing, swearing, and mistrusting
every one she sees. Gomesius in his third book of the Life and Deeds of
Francis Ximenius, sometime archbishop of Toledo, hath a strange story of
that incredible jealousy of Joan queen of Spain, wife to King Philip,
mother of Ferdinand and Charles the Fifth, emperors; when her husband
Philip, either for that he was tired with his wife's jealousy, or had some
great business, went into the Low Countries: she was so impatient and
melancholy upon his departure, that she would scarce eat her meat, or
converse with any man; and though she were with child, the season of the
year very bad, the wind against her, in all haste she would to sea after
him. Neither Isabella her queen mother, the archbishop, or any other friend
could persuade her to the contrary, but she would after him. When she was
now come into the Low Countries, and kindly entertained by her husband, she
could not contain herself, <a href="#note6131">[6131]</a><q>but in a rage ran upon a yellow-haired
wench,</q> with whom she suspected her husband to be naught, <q>cut off her
hair, did beat her black and blue, and so dragged her about.</q> It is an
ordinary thing for women in such cases to scratch the faces, slit the noses
of such as they suspect; as Henry the Second's importune Juno did by
Rosamond at Woodstock; for she complains in a <a href="#note6132">[6132]</a>modern poet, she
scarce spake,
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">But flies with eager fury to my face,</div>
<div class="line">Offering me most unwomanly disgrace.</div>
<div class="line">Look how a tigress, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line">So fell she on me in outrageous wise,</div>
<div class="line">As could disdain and jealousy devise.</div>
</div>
Or if it be so they dare not or cannot execute any such tyrannical
injustice, they will miscall, rail and revile, bear them deadly hate and
malice, as <a href="#note6133">[6133]</a>Tacitus observes, <q>The hatred of a jealous woman is
inseparable against such as she suspects.</q>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6134">[6134]</a>Nulla vis flammae tumidique venti</div>
<div class="line">Tanta, nec teli metuanda torti.</div>
<div class="line">Quanta cum conjux viduata taedis</div>
<div class="line">Ardet et odit.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Winds, weapons, flames make not such hurly burly,</div>
<div class="line">As raving women turn all topsy-turvy.</div>
</div>
So did Agrippina by Lollia, and Calphurnia in the days of Claudius. But
women are sufficiently curbed in such cases, the rage of men is more
eminent, and frequently put in practice. See but with what rigour those
jealous husbands tyrannise over their poor wives. In Greece, Spain, Italy,
Turkey, Africa, Asia, and generally over all those hot countries, <a href="#note6135">[6135]</a>
<span lang="la">Mulieres vestrae terra vestra, arate sicut vultis</span>. Mahomet in his Alcoran
gives this power to men, your wives are as your land, till them, use them,
entreat them fair or foul, as you will yourselves. <a href="#note6136">[6136]</a><span lang="la">Mecastor lege
dura vivunt mulieres</span>, they lock them still in their houses, which are so
many prisons to them. will suffer nobody to come at them, or their wives to
be seen abroad,&mdash;<span lang="la">nec campos liceat lustrare patentes</span>. They must not so
much as look out. And if they be great persons, they have eunuchs to keep
them, as the Grand Signior among the Turks, the Sophies of Persia, those
Tartarian Mogors, and Kings of China. <span lang="la">Infantes masculos castrant innumeros
ut regi serviant</span>, saith <a href="#note6137">[6137]</a>Riccius, <q>they geld innumerable infants</q> to
this purpose; the King of <a href="#note6138">[6138]</a>China <q>maintains 10,000 eunuchs in his
family to keep his wives.</q> The Xeriffes of Barbary keep their courtesans in
such a strict manner, that if any man come but in sight of them he dies for
it; and if they chance to see a man, and do not instantly cry out, though
from their windows, they must be put to death. The Turks have I know not
how many black, deformed eunuchs (for the white serve for other
ministeries) to this purpose sent commonly from Egypt, deprived in their
childhood of all their privities, and brought up in the seraglio at
Constantinople to keep their wives; which are so penned up they may not
confer with any living man, or converse with younger women, have a cucumber
or carrot sent into them for their diet, but sliced, for fear, &amp;c. and so
live and are left alone to their unchaste thoughts all the days of their
lives. The vulgar sort of women, if at any time they come abroad, which is
very seldom, to visit one another, or to go to their baths, are so covered,
that no man can see them, as the matrons were in old Rome, <span lang="la">lectica aut
sella tecta, vectae</span>, so <a href="#note6139">[6139]</a>Dion and Seneca record, <span lang="la">Velatae totae
incedunt</span>, which <a href="#note6140">[6140]</a>Alexander ab Alexandro relates of the Parthians,
<span class="cite">lib. 5. cap. 24.</span> which, with Andreas Tiraquellus his commentator, I
rather think should be understood of Persians. I have not yet said all,
they do not only lock them up, <span lang="la">sed et pudendis seras adhibent</span>: hear what
Bembus relates <span class="cite">lib. 6.</span> of his Venetian history, of those inhabitants that
dwell about Quilon in Africa. <span lang="la">Lusitani, inquit, quorundum civitates
adierunt: qui natis statim faeminis naturam consuunt, quoad urinae exitus ne
impediatur, easque quum adoleverint sic consutas in matrimonium collocant,
ut sponsi prima cura sit conglutinatas puellae oras ferro interscindere</span>. In
some parts of Greece at this day, like those old Jews, they will not
believe their wives are honest, <span lang="la">nisi pannum menstruatum prima nocte
videant</span>: our countryman <a href="#note6141">[6141]</a>Sands, in his peregrination, saith it is
severely observed in Zanzynthus, or Zante; and Leo Afer in his time at Fez,
in Africa, <span lang="la">non credunt virginem esse nisi videant sanguineam mappam; si
non, ad parentes pudore rejicitur</span>. Those sheets are publicly shown by
their parents, and kept as a sign of incorrupt virginity. The Jews of old
examined their maids <span lang="la">ex tenui membrana</span>, called Hymen, which Laurentius in

as amongst the Hebrews, amongst the Egyptians (read <a href="#note6148">[6148]</a>Bohemus <span class="cite">l. 1.

to be severely punished, cut in pieces, burned, <span lang="la">vivi-comburio</span>, buried
alive, with several expurgations, &amp;c. are they not as so many symptoms of
incredible jealousy? we may say the same of those vestal virgins that
fetched water in a sieve, as Tatia did in Rome, <i>anno ab. urb. condita
800.</i> before the senators; and <a href="#note6149">[6149]</a>Aemilia, <span lang="la">virgo innocens</span>, that ran
over hot irons, as Emma, Edward the Confessor's mother did, the king
himself being a spectator, with the like. We read in Nicephorus, that
Chunegunda the wife of Henricus Bavarus emperor, suspected of adultery,
<span lang="la">insimulata adulterii per ignitos vomeres illaesa transiit</span>, trod upon red
hot coulters, and had no harm: such another story we find in Regino <span class="cite">lib.
2.</span> In Aventinus and Sigonius of Charles the Third and his wife Richarda,
<i>an.</i> 887, that was so purged with hot irons. Pausanias saith, that he was
once an eyewitness of such a miracle at Diana's temple, a maid without any
harm at all walked upon burning coals. Pius Secund. in his description of
Europe, <span class="cite">c. 46.</span> relates as much, that it was commonly practised at Diana's
temple, for women to go barefoot over hot coals, to try their honesties:
Plinius, Solinus, and many writers, make mention of <a href="#note6150">[6150]</a>Geronia's
temple, and Dionysius Halicarnassus, <span class="cite">lib. 3.</span> of Memnon's statue, which
were used to this purpose. Tatius <span class="cite">lib. 6.</span> of Pan his cave, (much like old
St. Wilfrid's needle in Yorkshire) wherein they did use to try, maids,
<a href="#note6151">[6151]</a>whether they were honest; when Leucippe went in, <span lang="la">suavissimus
exaudiri sonus caepit</span> Austin <span class="cite">de civ. Dei lib. 10. c. 16.</span> relates many
such examples, all which Lavater <span class="cite">de spectr. part. 1. cap. 19</span> contends to
be done by the illusion of devils; though Thomas <span class="cite">quaest. 6. de polentia</span>,
&amp;c. ascribes it to good angels. Some, saith <a href="#note6152">[6152]</a>Austin, compel their
wives to swear they be honest, as if perjury were a lesser sin than
adultery; <a href="#note6153">[6153]</a>some consult oracles, as Phaerus that blind king of Egypt.
Others reward, as those old Romans used to do; if a woman were contented
with one man, <span lang="la">Corona pudicitiae donabatur</span>, she had a crown of chastity
bestowed on her. When all this will not serve, saith Alexander Gaguinus,
<span class="cite">cap. 5. descript. Muscoviae</span>, the Muscovites, if they suspect their wives,
will beat them till they confess, and if that will not avail, like those
wild Irish, be divorced at their pleasures, or else knock them on the
heads, as the old <a href="#note6154">[6154]</a>Gauls have done in former ages. Of this tyranny of
jealousy read more in Parthenius <span class="cite">Erot. cap. 10.</span> Camerarius <span class="cite">cap. 53. hor.

<h4><i>Prognostics of Jealousy. Despair, Madness, to make away themselves and others</i>.</h4>

<p>Those which are jealous, most part, if they be not otherwise relieved,
<a href="#note6155">[6155]</a><q>proceed from suspicion to hatred, from hatred to frenzy, madness,
injury, murder and despair.</q>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6156">[6156]</a>A plague by whose most damnable effect.</div>
<div class="line">Divers in deep despair to die have sought,</div>
<div class="line">By which a man to madness near is brought,</div>
<div class="line">As well with causeless as with just suspect.</div>
</div>
In their madness many times, saith <a href="#note6157">[6157]</a>Vives, they make away themselves
and others. Which induceth Cyprian to call it, <span lang="la">Foecundam et multiplicem
perniciem, fontem cladium et seminarium delictorum</span>, a fruitful mischief,
the seminary of offences, and fountain of murders. Tragical examples are
too common in this kind, both new and old, in all ages, as of <a href="#note6158">[6158]</a>
Cephalus and Procris, <a href="#note6159">[6159]</a>Phaereus of Egypt, Tereus, Atreus, and
Thyestes. <a href="#note6160">[6160]</a>Alexander Phaereus was murdered of his wife, <span lang="la">ob
pellicatus suspitionem</span>, Tully saith. Antoninus Verus was so made away by
Lucilla; Demetrius the son of Antigonus, and Nicanor, by their wives.
Hercules poisoned by Dejanira, <a href="#note6161">[6161]</a>Caecinna murdered by Vespasian,
Justina, a Roman lady, by her husband. <a href="#note6162">[6162]</a>Amestris, Xerxes' wife,
because she found her husband's cloak in Masista's house, cut off Masista,
his wife's paps, and gave them to the dogs, flayed her besides, and cut off
her ears, lips, tongue, and slit the nose of Artaynta her daughter. Our
late writers are full of such outrages.

<p><a href="#note6163">[6163]</a>Paulus Aemilius, in his history of France, hath a tragical story of
Chilpericus the First his death, made away by Ferdegunde his queen. In a
jealous humour he came from hunting, and stole behind his wife, as she was
dressing and combing her head in the sun, gave her a familiar touch with
his wand, which she mistaking for her lover, said, <q>Ah Landre, a good
knight should strike before, and not behind:</q> but when she saw herself
betrayed by his presence, she instantly took order to make him away.
Hierome Osorius, in his eleventh book of the deeds of Emanuel King of
Portugal, to this effect hath a tragical narration of one Ferdinandus
Chalderia, that wounded Gotherinus, a noble countryman of his, at Goa in
the East Indies, <a href="#note6164">[6164]</a><q>and cut off one of his legs, for that he looked as
he thought too familiarly upon his wife, which was afterwards a cause of
many quarrels, and much bloodshed.</q> Guianerius <span class="cite">cap. 36. de aegritud.
matr.</span> speaks of a silly jealous fellow, that seeing his child new-born
included in a caul, thought sure a <a href="#note6165">[6165]</a>Franciscan that used to come to
his house, was the father of it, it was so like the friar's cowl, and
thereupon threatened the friar to kill him: Fulgosus of a woman in
Narbonne, that cut off her husband's privities in the night, because she
thought he played false with her. The story of Jonuses Bassa, and fair
Manto his wife, is well known to such as have read the Turkish history; and
that of Joan of Spain, of which I treated in my former section. Her
jealousy, saith Gomesius, was the cause of both their deaths: King Philip
died for grief a little after, as <a href="#note6166">[6166]</a>Martian his physician gave it out,
<q>and she for her part after a melancholy discontented life, misspent in
lurking-holes and corners, made an end of her miseries.</q> Felix Plater, in
the first book of his observations, hath many such instances, of a
physician of his acquaintance, <a href="#note6167">[6167]</a><q>that was first mad through jealousy,
and afterwards desperate:</q> of a merchant <a href="#note6168">[6168]</a><q>that killed his wife in
the same humour, and after precipitated himself:</q> of a doctor of
law that cut off his man's nose: of a painter's wife in Basil, anno 1600,
that was mother of nine children and had been twenty-seven years married,
yet afterwards jealous, and so impatient that she became desperate, and
would neither eat nor drink in her own house, for fear her husband should
poison her. 'Tis a common sign this; for when once the humours are stirred,
and the imagination misaffected, it will vary itself in divers forms; and
many such absurd symptoms will accompany, even madness itself. Skenkius
<span class="cite">observat. lib. 4. cap. de Uter.</span> hath an example of a jealous
woman that by this means had many fits of the mother: and in his first book
of some that through jealousy ran mad: of a baker that gelded himself to
try his wife's honesty, &amp;c. Such examples are too common.

<p>As of all other melancholy, some doubt whether this malady may be cured or
no, they think 'tis like the <a href="#note6169">[6169]</a>gout, or Switzers, whom we commonly call
Walloons, those hired soldiers, if once they take possession of a castle,
they can never be got out.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Qui timet ut sua sit, ne quis sibi subtrahat illam,</div>
<div class="line">Ille Machaonia vix ope salvus est.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6170">[6170]</a>This is the cruel wound against whose smart,</div>
<div class="line">No liquor's force prevails, or any plaister,</div>
<div class="line">No skill of stars, no depth of magic art,</div>

<div class="line">As all our sense and reason it doth master;</div>
<div class="line">A wound whose pang and torment is so durable,</div>
<div class="line">As it may rightly called be incurable.</div>
</div>
Yet what I have formerly said of other melancholy, I will say again, it may
be cured or mitigated at least by some contrary passion, good counsel and
persuasion, if it be withstood in the beginning, maturely resisted, and as
those ancients hold, <a href="#note6171">[6171]</a><q>the nails of it be pared before they grow too
long.</q> No better means to resist or repel it than by avoiding idleness, to
be still seriously busied about some matters of importance, to drive out
those vain fears, foolish fantasies and irksome suspicions out of his head,
and then to be persuaded by his judicious friends, to give ear to their
good counsel and advice, and wisely to consider, how much he discredits
himself, his friends, dishonours his children, disgraceth his family,
publisheth his shame, and as a trumpeter of his own misery, divulgeth,
macerates, grieves himself and others; what an argument of weakness it is,
how absurd a thing in its own nature, how ridiculous, how brutish a
passion, how sottish, how odious; for as <a href="#note6172">[6172]</a>Hierome well hath it, <span lang="la">Odium
sui facit, et ipse novissime sibi odio est</span>, others hate him, and at last
he hates himself for it; how harebrain a disease, mad and furious. If he
will but hear them speak, no doubt he may be cured. <a href="#note6173">[6173]</a>Joan, queen of
Spain, of whom I have formerly spoken, under pretence of changing air was
sent to Complutum, or Alcada de las Heneras, where Ximenius the archbishop
of Toledo then lived, that by his good counsel (as for the present she was)
she might be eased. <a href="#note6174">[6174]</a><q>For a disease of the soul, if concealed, tortures
and overturns it, and by no physic can sooner be removed than by a discreet
man's comfortable speeches.</q> I will not here insert any consolatory
sentences to this purpose, or forestall any man's invention, but leave it
every one to dilate and amplify as he shall think fit in his own judgment:
let him advise with Siracides <span class="cite">cap. 9. 1.</span> <q>Be not jealous over the wife of
thy bosom;</q> read that comfortable and pithy speech to this purpose of
Ximenius, in the author himself, as it is recorded by Gomesius; consult
with Chaloner <span class="cite">lib. 9. de repub. Anglor.</span> or Caelia in her epistles, &amp;c.
Only this I will add, that if it be considered aright, which causeth this
jealous passion, be it just or unjust, whether with or without cause, true
or false, it ought not so heinously to be taken; 'tis no such real or
capital matter, that it should make so deep a wound. 'Tis a blow that hurts
not, an insensible smart, grounded many times upon false suspicion alone,
and so fostered by a sinister conceit. If she be not dishonest, he troubles
and macerates himself without a cause; or put case which is the worst, he
be a cuckold, it cannot be helped, the more he stirs in it, the more he
aggravates his own misery. How much better were it in such a case to
dissemble or contemn it? why should that be feared which cannot be
redressed? <span lang="la">multae tandem deposuerunt</span> (saith <a href="#note6175">[6175]</a>Vives) <span lang="la">quum flecti
maritos non posse vident</span>, many women, when they see there is no remedy,
have been pacified; and shall men be more jealous than women? 'Tis some
comfort in such a case to have companions, <span lang="la">Solamen miseris socios habuisse
doloris</span>; Who can say he is free? Who can assure himself he is not one <span lang="la">de
praeterito</span>, or secure himself <span lang="la">de futuro</span>? If it were his case alone, it
were hard; but being as it is almost a common calamity, 'tis not so
grievously to be taken. If a man have a lock, which every man's key will
open, as well as his own, why should he think to keep it private to
himself? In some countries they make nothing of it, <span lang="la">ne nobiles quidem</span>,
saith <a href="#note6176">[6176]</a>Leo Afer, in many parts of Africa (if she be past fourteen)
there's not a nobleman that marries a maid, or that hath a chaste wife;
'tis so common; as the moon gives horns once a month to the world, do they
to their husbands at least. And 'tis most part true which that Caledonian
lady, <a href="#note6177">[6177]</a>Argetocovus, a British prince's wife, told Julia Augusta, when
she took her up for dishonesty, <q>We Britons are naught at least with some
few choice men of the better sort, but you Romans lie with every base
knave, you are a company of common whores.</q> Severus the emperor in his time
made laws for the restraint of this vice; and as <a href="#note6178">[6178]</a>Dion Nicaeus relates
in his life, <span lang="la">tria millia maechorum</span>, three thousand cuckold-makers, or
<span lang="la">naturae monetam adulterantes</span>, as Philo calls them, false coiners, and
clippers of nature's money, were summoned into the court at once. And yet,
<span lang="la">Non omnem molitor quae fluit undam videt</span>, <q>the miller sees not all the
water that goes by his mill:</q> no doubt, but, as in our days, these were of
the commonalty, all the great ones were not so much as called in question
for it. <a href="#note6179">[6179]</a>Martial's Epigram I suppose might have been generally applied
in those licentious times, <span lang="la">Omnia solus habes</span>, &amp;c., thy goods, lands,
money, wits are thine own, <span lang="la">Uxorem sed habes Candide cum populo</span>; but
neighbour Candidus your wife is common: husband and cuckold in that age it
seems were reciprocal terms; the emperors themselves did wear Actaeon's
badge; how many Caesars might I reckon up together, and what a catalogue of
cornuted kings and princes in every story? Agamemnon, Menelaus, Philippus
of Greece, Ptolomeus of Egypt, Lucullus, Caesar, Pompeius, Cato, Augustus,
Antonius, Antoninus, &amp;c., that wore fair plumes of bull's feathers in their
crests. The bravest soldiers and most heroical spirits could not avoid it.
They have been active and passive in this business, they have either given
or taken horns. <a href="#note6180">[6180]</a>King Arthur, whom we call one of the nine worthies, for
all his great valour, was unworthily served by Mordred, one of his round
table knights: and Guithera, or Helena Alba, his fair wife, as Leland
interprets it, was an arrant honest woman. <span lang="la">Parcerem libenter</span> (saith mine
<a href="#note6181">[6181]</a>author) <span lang="la">Heroinarum laesae majestati, si non historiae veritas aurem
vellicaret</span>, I could willingly wink at a fair lady's faults, but that I am
bound by the laws of history to tell the truth: against his will, God
knows, did he write it, and so do I repeat it. I speak not of our times all
this while, we have good, honest, virtuous men and women, whom fame, zeal,
fear of God, religion and superstition contains: and yet for all that, we
have many knights of this order, so dubbed by their wives, many good women
abused by dissolute husbands. In some places, and such persons you may as
soon enjoin them to carry water in a sieve, as to keep themselves honest.
What shall a man do now in such a case? What remedy is to be had? how shall
he be eased? By suing a divorce? this is hard to be effected: <span lang="la">si non
caste, tamen caute</span> they carry the matter so cunningly, that though it be
as common as simony, as clear and as manifest as the nose in a man's face,
yet it cannot be evidently proved, or they likely taken in the fact: they
will have a knave Gallus to watch, or with that Roman <a href="#note6182">[6182]</a>Sulpitia, all

that like Hercules he hath any two fathers; for thou thyself hast
peradventure more diseases than a horse, more infirmities of body and mind,
a cankered soul, crabbed conditions, make the worst of it, as it is <span lang="la">vulnus

insensible. But art thou sure it is so? <a href="#note6189">[6189]</a><span lang="la">res agit ille tuas</span>? <q>doth he
so indeed?</q> It may be thou art over-suspicious, and without a cause as some
are: if it be <span lang="la">octimestris partus</span>, born at eight months, or like him, and
him, they fondly suspect he got it; if she speak or laugh familiarly with
such or such men, then presently she is naught with them; such is thy
weakness; whereas charity, or a well-disposed mind, would interpret all
unto the best. St. Francis, by chance seeing a friar familiarly kissing
another man's wife, was so far from misconceiving it, that he presently
kneeled down and thanked God there was so much charity left: but they on
the other side will ascribe nothing to natural causes, indulge nothing to
familiarity, mutual society, friendship: but out of a sinister suspicion,
presently lock them close, watch them, thinking by those means to prevent
all such inconveniences, that's the way to help it; whereas by such tricks
they do aggravate the mischief. 'Tis but in vain to watch that which will
away.

In the time of Valence the Emperor, saith <a href="#note6199">[6199]</a>St. Austin, one Archidamus,
a Consul of Antioch, offered a hundred pounds of gold to a fair young wife,
and besides to set her husband free, who was then <span lang="la">sub gravissima
custodia</span>, a dark prisoner, <span lang="la">pro unius noctis concubitu</span>: but the chaste
matron would not accept of it. <a href="#note6200">[6200]</a>When Ode commended Theana's fine arm to
his fellows, she took him up short, <q>Sir, 'tis not common:</q> she is wholly
reserved to her husband. <a href="#note6201">[6201]</a>Bilia had an old man to her spouse, and his
breath stunk, so that nobody could abide it abroad; <q>coming home one day he

clamorous as Hecuba, as lustful as Messalina, by such means (if at all) she
may be reformed. Many patient <a href="#note6204">[6204]</a>Grizels, by their obsequiousness in this
kind, have reclaimed their husbands from their wandering lusts. In Nova
Francia and Turkey (as Leah, Rachel, and Sarah did to Abraham and Jacob)
they bring their fairest damsels to their husbands' beds; Livia seconded
the lustful appetites of Augustus: Stratonice, wife to King Diotarus, did
not only bring Electra, a fair maid, to her good man's bed, but brought up
the children begot on her, as carefully as if they had been her own.
Tertius Emilius' wife, Cornelia's mother, perceiving her husband's
intemperance, <span lang="la">rem dissimulavit</span>, made much of the maid, and would take no
notice of it. A new-married man, when a pickthank friend of his, to curry
favour, had showed him his wife familiar in private with a young gallant,
courting and dallying, &amp;c. Tush, said he, let him do his worst, I dare
trust my wife, though I dare not trust him. The best remedy then is by fair
means; if that will not take place, to dissemble it as I say, or turn it
off with a jest: hear Guexerra's advice in this case, <span lang="la">vel joco excipies,
vel silentio eludes</span>; for if you take exceptions at everything your wife
doth, Solomon's wisdom, Hercules' valour, Homer's learning, Socrates'
patience, Argus' vigilance, will not serve turn. Therefore <span lang="la">Minus malum</span>,

<a href="#note6207">[6207]</a><q>A good fellow, when his wife was brought to bed before her time,

Emperor, when one told him a fiddler was too familiar with his empress,
made no reckoning of it. And when that Macedonian Philip was upbraided with
his wife's dishonesty, <span lang="la">cum tot victor regnorum ac populorum esset</span>, &amp;c., a
conqueror of kingdoms could not tame his wife (for she thrust him out of
doors), he made a jest of it. <span lang="la">Sapientes portant cornua in pectore, stulti
in fronte</span>, saith Nevisanus, wise men bear their horns in their hearts,
fools on their foreheads. Eumenes, king of Pergamus, was at deadly feud
with Perseus of Macedonia, insomuch that Perseus hearing of a journey he
was to take to Delphos, <a href="#note6209">[6209]</a>set a company of soldiers to intercept him in
his passage; they did it accordingly, and as they supposed left him stoned
to death. The news of this fact was brought instantly to Pergamus; Attalus,
Eumenes' brother, proclaimed himself king forthwith, took possession of the
crown, and married Stratonice the queen. But by-and-by, when contrary news
was brought, that King Eumenes was alive, and now coming to the city, he
laid by his crown, left his wife, as a private man went to meet him, and
congratulate his return. Eumenes, though he knew all particulars passed,
yet dissembling the matter, kindly embraced his brother, and took his wife
into his favour again, as if on such matter had been heard of or done.
Jocundo, in Ariosto, found his wife in bed with a knave, both asleep, went
his ways, and would not so much as wake them, much less reprove them for
it. <a href="#note6210">[6210]</a>An honest fellow finding in like sort his wife had played false at
tables, and borne a man too many, drew his dagger, and swore if he had not
been his very friend, he would have killed him. Another hearing one had
done that for him, which no man desires to be done by a deputy, followed in
a rage with his sword drawn, and having overtaken him, laid adultery to his
charge; the offender hotly pursued, confessed it was true; with which
confession he was satisfied, and so left him, swearing that if he had
denied it, he would not have put it up. How much better is it to do thus,
than to macerate himself, impatiently to rave and rage, to enter an action
(as Arnoldus Tilius did in the court of Toulouse, against Martin Guerre his
fellow-soldier, for that he counterfeited his habit, and was too familiar
with his wife), so to divulge his own shame, and to remain for ever a
cuckold on record? how much better be Cornelius Tacitus than Publius
Cornutus, to condemn in such cases, or take no notice of it? <span lang="la">Melius sic
errare, quam Zelotypiae curis</span>, saith Erasmus, <span lang="la">se conficere</span>, better be a
wittol and put it up, than to trouble himself to no purpose. And though he
will not <span lang="la">omnibus dormire</span>, be an ass, as he is an ox, yet to wink at it as
many do is not amiss at some times, in some cases, to some parties, if it
be for his commodity, or some great man's sake, his landlord, patron,
benefactor, (as Calbas the Roman saith <a href="#note6211">[6211]</a>Plutarch did by Maecenas, and
Phayllus of Argos did by King Philip, when he promised him an office on
that condition he might lie with his wife) and so let it pass:

complaining of her unchasteness, to reject it, and comfort himself; for he
that suspects his wife's incontinency, and fears the Pope's curse, shall
never live a merry hour, or sleep a quiet night: no remedy but patience.
When all is done according to that counsel of <a href="#note6215">[6215]</a>Nevisanus, <span lang="la">si vitium

<h4><a name="3.3.4.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>By prevention before, or after Marriage, Plato's Community, marry a Courtesan, Philters, Stews, to marry one equal in years, fortunes, of a good family, education, good place, to use them well, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Of such medicines as conduce to the cure of this malady, I have
sufficiently treated; there be some good remedies remaining, by way of
prevention, precautions, or admonitions, which if rightly practised, may do
much good. Plato, in his Commonwealth, to prevent this mischief belike,
would have all things, wives and children, all as one: and which Caesar in
his Commentaries observed of those old Britons, that first inhabited this
land, they had ten or twelve wives allotted to such a family, or
promiscuously to be used by so many men; not one to one, as with us, or
four, five, or six to one, as in Turkey. The <a href="#note6217">[6217]</a>Nicholaites, a set that
sprang, saith Austin, from Nicholas the deacon, would have women
indifferent; and the cause of this filthy sect, was Nicholas the deacon's
jealousy, for which when he was condemned to purge himself of his offence,
he broached his heresy, that it was lawful to lie with one another's wives,
and for any man to lie with his: like to those <a href="#note6218">[6218]</a>Anabaptists in Munster,
that would consort with other men's wives as the spirit moved them: or as
<a href="#note6219">[6219]</a>Mahomet, the seducing prophet, would needs use women as he list
himself, to beget prophets; two hundred and five, their Alcoran saith, were
in love with him, and <a href="#note6220">[6220]</a>he as able as forty men. Amongst the old
Carthaginians, as <a href="#note6221">[6221]</a>Bohemus relates out of Sabellicus., the king of the
country lay with the bride the first night, and once in a year they went
promiscuously all together. Munster <span class="cite">Cosmog. lib. 3. cap. 497.</span> ascribes
the beginning of this brutish custom (unjustly) to one Picardus, a
Frenchman, that invented a new sect of Adamites, to go naked as Adam did,
and to use promiscuous venery at set times. When the priest repeated that
of Genesis, <q>Increase and multiply,</q> out <a href="#note6222">[6222]</a>went the candles in the place
where they met, <q>and without all respect of age, persons, conditions, catch
that catch may, every man took her that came next,</q> &amp;c.; some fasten this
on those ancient Bohemians and Russians: <a href="#note6223">[6223]</a>others on the inhabitants of
Mambrium, in the Lucerne valley in Piedmont; and, as I read, it was
practised in Scotland amongst Christians themselves, until King Malcolm's
time, the king or the lord of the town had their maidenheads. In some parts
of <a href="#note6224">[6224]</a>India in our age, and those <a href="#note6225">[6225]</a>islanders, <a href="#note6226">[6226]</a>as amongst the
Babylonians of old, they will prostitute their wives and daughters (which
Chalcocondila, a Greek modern writer, for want of better intelligence, puts
upon us Britons) to such travellers or seafaring men as come amongst them
by chance, to show how far they were from this feral vice of jealousy, and
how little they esteemed it. The kings of Calecut, as <a href="#note6227">[6227]</a>Lod. Vertomannus
relates, will not touch their wives, till one of their Biarmi or high
priests have lain first with them, to sanctify their wombs. But those Esai
and Montanists, two strange sects of old, were in another extreme, they
would not marry at all, or have any society with women, <a href="#note6228">[6228]</a><q>because of
their intemperance they held them all to be naught.</q> Nevisanus the lawyer,
<span class="cite">lib. 4. num. 33. sylv. nupt.</span> would have him that is inclined to this
malady, to prevent the worst, marry a quean, <span lang="la">Capiens meretricem, hoc habet
saltem boni quod non decipitur, quia scit eam sic esse, quod non contingit
aliis</span>. A fornicator in Seneca constuprated two wenches in a night; for
satisfaction, the one desired to hang him, the other to marry him. <a href="#note6229">[6229]</a>
Hierome, king of Syracuse in Sicily, espoused himself to Pitho, keeper of
the stews; and Ptolemy took Thais a common whore to be his wife, had two
sons, Leontiscus and Lagus by her, and one daughter Irene: 'tis therefore
no such unlikely thing. <a href="#note6230">[6230]</a>A citizen of Engubine gelded himself to try his
wife's honesty, and to be freed from jealousy; so did a baker in <a href="#note6231">[6231]</a>
Basil, to the same intent. But of all other precedents in this kind, that
of <a href="#note6232">[6232]</a>Combalus is most memorable; who to prevent his master's suspicion,
for he was a beautiful young man, and sent by Seleucus his lord and king,
with Stratonice the queen to conduct her into Syria, fearing the worst,
gelded himself before he went, and left his genitals behind him in a box
sealed up. His mistress by the way fell in love with him, but he not
yielding to her, was accused to Seleucus of incontinency, (as that
Bellerophon was in like case, falsely traduced by Sthenobia, to King Praetus
her husband, <span lang="la">cum non posset ad coitum inducere)</span> and that by her, and was
therefore at his corning home cast into prison: the day of hearing
appointed, he was sufficiently cleared and acquitted, by showing his
privities, which to the admiration of the beholders he had formerly cut
off. The Lydians used to geld women whom they suspected, saith Leonicus
<span class="cite">var. hist. Tib. 3. cap. 49.</span> as well as men. To this purpose <a href="#note6233">[6233]</a>Saint
Francis, because he used to confess women in private, to prevent suspicion,
and prove himself a maid, stripped himself before the Bishop of Assise and
others: and Friar Leonard for the same cause went through Viterbium in
Italy, without any garments.

<p>Our pseudo-Catholics, to help these inconveniences which proceed from
jealousy, to keep themselves and their wives honest, make severe laws;
against adultery present death; and withal fornication, a venal sin, as a
sink to convey that furious and swift stream of concupiscence, they appoint
and permit stews, those punks and pleasant sinners, the more to secure
their wives in all populous cities, for they hold them as necessary as
churches; and howsoever unlawful, yet to avoid a greater mischief, to be
tolerated in policy, as usury, for the hardness of men's hearts; and for
this end they have whole colleges of courtesans in their towns and cities.
Of <a href="#note6234">[6234]</a>Cato's mind belike, that would have his servants (<span lang="la">cum ancillis
congredi coitus causa, definito aere, ut graviora facinora evitarent,
caeteris interim interdicens</span>) familiar with some such feminine creatures,
to avoid worse mischiefs in his house, and made allowance for it. They hold
it impossible for idle persons, young, rich, and lusty, so many servants,
monks, friars, to live honest, too tyrannical a burden to compel them to be
chaste, and most unfit to suffer poor men, younger brothers and soldiers at
all to marry, as those diseased persons, votaries, priests, servants.
Therefore, as well to keep and ease the one as the other, they tolerate and
wink at these kind of brothel-houses and stews. Many probable arguments
they have to prove the lawfulness, the necessity, and a toleration of them,
as of usury; and without question in policy they are not to be
contradicted: but altogether in religion. Others prescribe filters, spells,
charms to keep men and women honest. <a href="#note6235">[6235]</a><span lang="la">Mulier ut alienum virum non

invenies, et multo his absurdiora, uti et in Rhasi, ne mulier virum
admittat, et maritum solum diligat</span>, &amp;c. But these are most part Pagan,
impious, irreligious, absurd, and ridiculous devices.

<p>The best means to avoid these and like inconveniences are, to take away the
causes and occasions. To this purpose <a href="#note6236">[6236]</a>Varro writ <span class="cite">Satyram Menippeam</span>,
but it is lost. <a href="#note6237">[6237]</a>Patritius prescribes four rules to be observed in
choosing of a wife (which who so will may read); Fonseca, the Spaniard, in
his <span class="cite">45. c. Amphitheat. Amoris</span>, sets down six special cautions for men,
four for women; Sam. Neander out of Shonbernerus, five for men, five for
women; Anthony Guivarra many good lessons; <a href="#note6238">[6238]</a>Cleobulus two alone,
others otherwise; as first to make a good choice in marriage, to invite
Christ to their wedding, and which <a href="#note6239">[6239]</a>St. Ambrose adviseth, <span lang="la">Deum
conjugii praesidem habere</span>, and to pray to him for her, <span lang="la">A Domino enim
datur uxor prudens</span>, <span class="bibcite">Prov. xix.</span> ) not to be too rash and precipitate in his
election, to run upon the first he meets, or dote on every stout fair piece
he sees, but to choose her as much by his ears as eyes, to be well advised
whom he takes, of what age, &amp;c., and cautelous in his proceedings. An old
man should not marry a young woman, nor a young woman an old man, <a href="#note6240">[6240]</a>
<span lang="la">Quam male inaequales veniunt ad arata juvenci!</span> such matches must needs
minister a perpetual cause of suspicion, and be distasteful to each other.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6241">[6241]</a>Noctua ut in tumulis, super atque cadavera bubo,</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Night-crows on tombs, owl sits on carcass dead,</div>
<div class="line">So lies a wench with Sophocles in bed.</div>
</div>
For Sophocles, as <a href="#note6242">[6242]</a>Atheneus describes him, was a very old man, as cold
as January, a bedfellow of bones, and doted yet upon Archippe, a young
courtesan, than which nothing can be more odious. <a href="#note6243">[6243]</a><span lang="la">Senex maritus uxori
juveni ingratus est</span>, an old man is a most unwelcome guest to a young
wench, unable, unfit:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6244">[6244]</a>Amplexus suos fugiunt puellae,</div>
<div class="line">Omnis horret amor Venusque Hymenque.</div>
</div>
And as in like case a good fellow that had but a peck of corn weekly to
grind, yet would needs build a new mill for it, found his error eftsoons,
for either he must let his mill lie waste, pull it quite down, or let
others grind at it. So these men, &amp;c.

<p>Seneca therefore disallows all such unseasonable matches, <span lang="la">habent enim
maledicti locum crebrae nuptiae.</span> And as <a href="#note6245">[6245]</a>Tully farther inveighs, <q>'tis
unfit for any, but ugly and filthy in old age.</q> <span lang="la">Turpe senilis amor</span>, one
of the three things <a href="#note6246">[6246]</a>God hateth. Plutarch, in his book <span class="cite">contra Coleten</span>,
rails downright at such kind of marriages, which are attempted by old men,
<span lang="la">qui jam corpore impotenti, et a voluptatibus deserti, peccant animo</span>, and
makes a question whether in some cases it be tolerable at least for such a
man to marry,&mdash;<span lang="la">qui Venerem affectat sine viribus</span>, <q>that is now past those
venerous exercises,</q> <q>as a gelded man lies with a virgin and sighs,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Ecclus. xxx. 20</span>, and now complains with him in Petronius, <span lang="la">funerata est haec

<div class="line"><a href="#note6247">[6247]</a>Vixit puellae nuper idoneus,</div>
<div class="line">Et militavit non sine gloria.</div>
</div>
But the question is whether he may delight himself as those Priapeian
popes, which, in their decrepit age, lay commonly between two wenches every
night, <span lang="la">contactu formosarum, et contrectatione, num adhuc gaudeat</span>; and as
many doting sires do to their own shame, their children's undoing, and
their families' confusion: he abhors it, <span lang="la">tanquam ab agresti et furioso

</div>
the devil himself makes such matches. <a href="#note6249">[6249]</a>Levinus Lemnius reckons up three
things which generally disturb the peace of marriage: the first is when
they marry intempestive or unseasonably, <q>as many mortal men marry
precipitately and inconsiderately, when they are effete and old: the second
when they marry unequally for fortunes and birth: the third, when a sick
impotent person weds one that is sound, <span lang="la">novae nuptae spes frustratur</span>: many
dislikes instantly follow.</q> Many doting dizzards, it may not be denied, as
Plutarch confesseth, <a href="#note6250">[6250]</a><q>recreate themselves with such obsolete,
unseasonable and filthy remedies</q> (so he calls them), <q>with a remembrance of
their former pleasures, against nature they stir up their dead flesh:</q> but
an old lecher is abominable; <span lang="la">mulier tertio nubens</span>, <a href="#note6251">[6251]</a>Nevisanus holds,
<span lang="la">praesumitur lubrica, et inconstans</span>, a woman that marries a third time may
be presumed to be no honester than she should. Of them both, thus Ambrose
concludes in his comment upon Luke, <a href="#note6252">[6252]</a><q>they that are coupled together,
not to get children, but to satisfy their lust, are not husbands, but
fornicators,</q> with whom St. Austin consents: matrimony without hope of
children, <span lang="la">non matrimonium, sed concubium dici debet</span>, is not a wedding but
a jumbling or coupling together. In a word (except they wed for mutual
society, help and comfort one of another, in which respects, though
<a href="#note6253">[6253]</a>Tiberius deny it, without question old folks may well marry) for
sometimes a man hath most need of a wife, according to Puccius, when he
hath no need of a wife; otherwise it is most odious, when an old Acherontic
dizzard, that hath one foot in his grave, <span lang="la">a silicernium</span>, shall flicker
after a young wench that is blithe and bonny,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6254">[6254]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;salaciorque</div>
<div class="line">Verno passere, et albulis columbis.</div>
</div>
What can be more detestable?
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6255">[6255]</a>Tu cano capite amas senex nequissime</div>
<div class="line">Jam plenus aetatis, animaque foetida,</div>
<div class="line">Senex hircosus tu osculare mulierem?</div>

<div class="line">Must thou be slavering? she spews to see</div>
<div class="line">Thy filthy face, it doth so move.</div>
</div>
Yet, as some will, it is much more tolerable for an old man to marry a
young woman (our ladies' match they call it) for <span lang="la">cras erit mulier</span>, as he
said in Tully. Cato the Roman, Critobulus in <a href="#note6256">[6256]</a>Xenophon, <a href="#note6257">[6257]</a>Tiraquellus
of late, Julius Scaliger, &amp;c., and many famous precedents we have in that
kind; but not <span lang="la">e contra</span>: 'tis not held fit for an ancient woman to match
with a young man. For as Varro will, <span lang="la">Anus dum ludit morti delitias facit</span>,
'tis Charon's match between <a href="#note6258">[6258]</a>Cascus and Casca, and the devil himself is
surely well pleased with it. And, therefore, as the <a href="#note6259">[6259]</a>poet inveighs, thou
old Vetustina bedridden quean, that art now skin and bones,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Cui tres capilli, quatuorque sunt dentes,</div>
<div class="line">Pectus cicadae, crusculumque formicae,</div>
<div class="line">Rugosiorem quae geris stola frontem,</div>
<div class="line">Et arenaram cassibus pares mammas.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">That hast three hairs, four teeth, a breast</div>
<div class="line">Like grasshopper, an emmet's crest, </div>
<div class="line">A skin more rugged than thy coat,</div>
<div class="line">And drugs like spider's web to boot.</div>
</div>
Must thou marry a youth again? And yet <span lang="la">ducentas ire nuptum post mortes
amant</span>: howsoever it is, as <a href="#note6260">[6260]</a>Apuleius gives out of his Meroe,
<span lang="la">congressus annosus, pestilens, abhorrendus</span>, a pestilent match,
abominable, and not to be endured. In such case how can they otherwise
choose but be jealous, how should they agree one with another? This
inequality is not in years only, but in birth, fortunes, conditions, and
all good <a href="#note6261">[6261]</a>qualities, <span lang="la">si qua voles apte nubere, nube pari</span>, 'tis my
counsel, saith Anthony Guiverra, to choose such a one. <span lang="la">Civis Civem ducat,
Nobilis Nobilem</span>, let a citizen match with a citizen, a gentleman with a
gentlewoman; he that observes not this precept (saith he) <span lang="la">non generum sed
malum Genium, non nurum sed Furiam, non vitae Comitem, sed litis fomitem
domi habebit</span>, instead of a fair wife shall have a fury, for a fit
son-in-law a mere fiend, &amp;c. examples are too frequent.

<p>Another main caution fit to be observed is this, that though they be equal
in years, birth, fortunes, and other conditions, yet they do not omit
virtue and good education, which Musonius and Antipater so much inculcate
in Stobeus:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6262">[6262]</a>Dos est magna parentum</div>
<div class="line">Virtus, et metuens alterius viri</div>
<div class="line">Certo foedere castitas.</div>
</div>
If, as Plutarch adviseth, one must eat <span lang="la">modium salis</span>, a bushel of salt
with him, before he choose his friend, what care should be had in choosing
a wife, his second self, how solicitous should he be to know her qualities
and behaviour; and when he is assured of them, not to prefer birth,
fortune, beauty, before bringing up, and good conditions. <a href="#note6263">[6263]</a>Coquage god
of cuckolds, as one merrily said, accompanies the goddess Jealousy, both
follow the fairest, by Jupiter's appointment, and they sacrifice to them
together: beauty and honesty seldom agree; straight personages have often
crooked manners; fair faces, foul vices; good complexions, ill conditions.
<span lang="la">Suspicionis plena res est, et insidiarum</span>, beauty (saith <a href="#note6264">[6264]</a>Chrysostom)
is full of treachery and suspicion: he that hath a fair wife, cannot have a
worse mischief, and yet most covet it, as if nothing else in marriage but
that and wealth were to be respected. <a href="#note6265">[6265]</a>Francis Sforza, Duke of Milan,
was so curious in this behalf, that he would not marry the Duke of Mantua's
daughter, except he might see her naked first: which Lycurgus appointed in
his laws, and Morus in his Utopian Commonwealth approves. <a href="#note6266">[6266]</a>In Italy, as
a traveller observes, if a man have three or four daughters, or more, and
they prove fair, they are married eftsoons: if deformed, they change their
lovely names of Lucia, Cynthia, Camaena, call them Dorothy, Ursula, Bridget,
and so put them into monasteries, as if none were fit for marriage, but
such as are eminently fair: but these are erroneous tenets: a modest virgin
well conditioned, to such a fair snout-piece, is much to be preferred. If
thou wilt avoid them, take away all causes of suspicion and jealousy, marry
a coarse piece, fetch her from Cassandra's <a href="#note6267">[6267]</a>temple, which was wont in
Italy to be a sanctuary of all deformed maids, and so shalt thou be sure
that no man will make thee cuckold, but for spite. A citizen of Bizance in
France had a filthy, dowdy, deformed slut to his wife, and finding her in
bed with another man, cried out as one amazed; <span lang="la">O miser! quae te necessitas
huc adegit</span>? O thou wretch, what necessity brought thee hither? as well he
might; for who can affect such a one? But this is warily to be understood,
most offend in another extreme, they prefer wealth before beauty, and so
she be rich, they care not how she look; but these are all out as faulty as
the rest. <span lang="la">Attendenda uxoris forma</span>, as <a href="#note6268">[6268]</a>Salisburiensis adviseth, <span lang="la">ne si
alteram aspexeris, mox eam sordere putes</span>, as the Knight in Chaucer, that
was married to an old woman,
<div class="blackletter">
<div class="line">And all day after hid him as an owl,</div>
<div class="line">So woe was his wife looked so foul.</div>
</div>
Have a care of thy wife's complexion, lest whilst thou seest another, thou
loathest her, she prove jealous, thou naught,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6269">[6269]</a>Si tibi deformis conjux, si serva venusta,</div>
<div class="line">Ne utaris serva,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
I can perhaps give instance. <span lang="la">Molestum est possidere, quod nemo habere
dignetur</span>, a misery to possess that which no man likes: on the other side,
<span lang="la">Difficile custoditur quod plures amant.</span> And as the bragging soldier
vaunted in the comedy, <span lang="la">nimia est miseria pulchrum esse hominem nimis.</span>
Scipio did never so hardly besiege Carthage, as these young gallants will
beset thine house, one with wit or person, another with wealth, &amp;c. If she
he fair, saith Guazzo, she will be suspected howsoever. Both extremes are
naught, <span lang="la">Pulchra cito adamatur, foeda facile concupiscit</span>, the one is soon
beloved, the other loves: one is hardly kept, because proud and arrogant,
the other not worth keeping; what is to be done in this case? Ennius in
Menelippe adviseth thee as a friend to take <span lang="la">statam formam, si vis habere
incolumem pudicitiam</span>, one of a middle size, neither too fair nor too foul,
<a href="#note6270">[6270]</a><span lang="la">Nec formosa magis quam mihi casta placet</span>, with old Cato, though fit
let her beauty be, <span lang="la">neque lectissima, neque illiberalis</span>, between both.
This I approve; but of the other two I resolve with Salisburiensis,
<span lang="la">caeteris paribus</span>, both rich alike, endowed alike, <span lang="la">majori miseria deformis
habetur quam formosa servatur</span>, I had rather marry a fair one, and put it
to the hazard, than be troubled with a blowze; but do as thou wilt, I speak
only of myself.

<p>Howsoever, <span lang="la">quod iterum maneo</span>, I would advise thee thus much, be she fair
or foul, to choose a wife out of a good kindred, parentage, well brought
up, in an honest place.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6271">[6271]</a>Primum animo tibi proponas quo sanguine creta.</div>

He that marries a wife out of a suspected inn or alehouse, buys a horse in
Smithfield, and hires a servant in Paul's, as the diverb is, shall likely
have a jade to his horse, a knave for his man, an arrant honest woman to
his wife. <span lang="la">Filia praesumitur, esse matri similis</span>, saith <a href="#note6272">[6272]</a>Nevisanus?
<q>Such <a href="#note6273">[6273]</a>a mother, such a daughter;</q> <span lang="la">mali corvi malum ovum.</span>, cat to her
kind.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6274">[6274]</a>Scilicet expectas ut tradat mater honestos</div>

<q>If the dam trot, the foal will not amble.</q> My last caution is, that a
woman do not bestow herself upon a fool, or an apparent melancholy person;
jealousy is a symptom of that disease, and fools have no moderation.
Justina, a Roman lady, was much persecuted, and after made away by her
jealous husband, she caused and enjoined this epitaph, as a caveat to
others, to be engraven on her tomb:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6275">[6275]</a>Discite ab exemplo Justinae, discite patres,</div>
<div class="line">Ne nubat fatuo filia vestra viro, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Learn parents all, and by Justina's case,</div>
<div class="line">Your children to no dizzards for to place.</div>
</div>
After marriage, I can give no better admonitions than to use their wives
well, and which a friend of mine told me that was a married man, I will
tell you as good cheap, saith Nicostratus in <a href="#note6276">[6276]</a>Stobeus, to avoid future
strife, and for quietness' sake, <q>when you are in bed, take heed of your
wife's flattering speeches over night, and curtain, sermons in the
morning.</q> Let them do their endeavour likewise to maintain them to their
means, which <a href="#note6277">[6277]</a>Patricius ingeminates, and let them have liberty with
discretion, as time and place requires: many women turn queans by
compulsion, as <a href="#note6278">[6278]</a>Nevisanus observes, because their husbands are so hard,
and keep them so short in diet and apparel, <span lang="la">paupertas cogit eas
meretricari</span>, poverty and hunger, want of means, makes them dishonest, or
bad usage; their churlish behaviour forceth them to fly out, or bad
examples, they do it to cry quittance. In the other extreme some are too
liberal, as the proverb is, <span lang="la">Turdus malum sibi cacat</span>, they make a rod for
their own tails, as Candaules did to Gyges in <a href="#note6279">[6279]</a>Herodotus, commend his
wife's beauty himself, and besides would needs have him see her naked.
Whilst they give their wives too much liberty to gad abroad, and bountiful
allowance, they are accessory to their own miseries; <span lang="la">animae uxorum pessime
olent</span>, as Plautus jibes, they have deformed souls, and by their painting
and colours procure <span lang="la">odium mariti</span>, their husband's hate, especially,&mdash;<a href="#note6280">[6280]</a>
<span lang="la">cum misere viscantur labra mariti</span>. Besides, their wives (as <a href="#note6281">[6281]</a>Basil
notes) <span lang="la">Impudenter se exponunt masculorum aspectibus, jactantes tunicas, et
coram tripudiantes</span>, impudently thrust themselves into other men's
companies, and by their indecent wanton carriage provoke and tempt the
spectators. Virtuous women should keep house; and 'twas well performed and
ordered by the Greeks,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6282">[6282]</a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;mulier ne qua in publicum</div>
<div class="line">Spectandam se sine arbitro praebeat viro:</div>
</div>
which made Phidias belike at Elis paint Venus treading on a tortoise, a
symbol of women's silence and housekeeping. For a woman abroad and alone,
is like a deer broke out of a park, <span lang="la">quam mille venatores insequuntur</span>,
whom every hunter follows; and besides in such places she cannot so well
vindicate herself, but as that virgin Dinah (<span class="bibcite">Gen. xxxiv., 2</span>,) <q>going for to
see the daughters of the land,</q> lost her virginity, she may be defiled and
overtaken of a sudden: <span lang="la">Imbelles damae quid nisi praeda sumus</span>? <a href="#note6283">[6283]</a>

<p>And therefore I know not what philosopher he was, that would have women
come but thrice abroad all their time, <a href="#note6284">[6284]</a><q>to be baptised, married, and
buried;</q> but he was too strait-laced. Let them have their liberty in good
sort, and go in good sort, <span lang="la">modo non annos viginti aetatis suae domi
relinquant</span>, as a good fellow said, so that they look not twenty years
younger abroad than they do at home, they be not spruce, neat, angels
abroad, beasts, dowdies, sluts at home; but seek by all means to please and
give content to their husbands: to be quiet above all things, obedient,
silent and patient; if they be incensed, angry, chid a little, their wives
must not <a href="#note6285">[6285]</a>cample again, but take it in good part. An honest woman, I
cannot now tell where she dwelt, but by report an honest woman she was,
hearing one of her gossips by chance complain of her husband's impatience,
told her an excellent remedy for it, and gave her withal a glass of water,
which when he brawled she should hold still in her mouth, and that <span lang="la">toties
quoties</span>, as often as he chid; she did so two or three times with good
success, and at length seeing her neighbour, gave her great thanks for it,
and would needs know the ingredients, <a href="#note6286">[6286]</a>she told her in brief what it
was, <q>fair water,</q> and no more: for it was not the water, but her silence
which performed the cure. Let every froward woman imitate this example, and
be quiet within doors, and (as <a href="#note6287">[6287]</a>M. Aurelius prescribes) a necessary
caution it is to be observed of all good matrons that love their credits,
to come little abroad, but follow their work at home, look to their
household affairs and private business, <span lang="la">oeconomiae incumbentes</span>, be sober,
thrifty, wary, circumspect, modest, and compose themselves to live to their
husbands' means, as a good housewife should do,

<p>These cautions concern him; and if by those or his own discretion otherwise
he cannot moderate himself, his friends must not be wanting by their
wisdom, if it be possible, to give the party grieved satisfaction, to
prevent and remove the occasions, objects, if it may be to secure him. If
it be one alone, or many, to consider whom he suspects or at what times, in
what places he is most incensed, in what companies. <a href="#note6290">[6290]</a>Nevisanus makes a
question whether a young physician ought to be admitted in cases of
sickness, into a new-married man's house, to administer a julep, a syrup,
or some such physic. The Persians of old would not suffer a young physician
to come amongst women. <a href="#note6291">[6291]</a>Apollonides Cous made Artaxerxes cuckold, and
was after buried alive for it. A goaler in Aristaenetus had a fine young
gentleman to his prisoner; <a href="#note6292">[6292]</a>in commiseration of his youth and person he
let him loose, to enjoy the liberty of the prison, but he unkindly made him
a cornuto. Menelaus gave good welcome to Paris a stranger, his whole house
and family were at his command, but he ungently stole away his best beloved
wife. The like measure was offered to Agis king of Lacedaemon, by <a href="#note6293">[6293]</a>
Alcibiades an exile, for his good entertainment, he was too familiar with
Timea his wife, begetting a child of her, called Leotichides: and bragging
moreover when he came home to Athens, that he had a son should be king of
the Lacedaemonians. If such objects were removed, no doubt but the parties
might easily be satisfied, or that they could use them gently and entreat
them well, not to revile them, scoff at, hate them, as in such cases
commonly they do, 'tis a human infirmity, a miserable vexation, and they
should not add grief to grief, nor aggravate their misery, but seek to
please, and by all means give them content, by good counsel, removing such
offensive objects, or by mediation of some discreet friends. In old Rome
there was a temple erected by the matrons to that <a href="#note6294">[6294]</a><span lang="la">Viriplaca Dea</span>,
another to Venus <span lang="la">verticorda, quae maritos uxoribus reddebat benevolos</span>,
whither (if any difference happened between man and wife) they did
instantly resort: there they did offer sacrifice, a white hart, Plutarch
records, <span lang="la">sine felle</span>, without the gall, (some say the like of Juno's
temple) and make their prayers for conjugal peace; before some <a href="#note6295">[6295]</a>
indifferent arbitrators and friends, the matter was heard between man and
wife, and commonly composed. In our times we want no sacred churches, or
good men to end such controversies, if use were made, of them. Some say
that precious stone called <a href="#note6296">[6296]</a>beryllus, others a diamond, hath excellent
virtue, <span lang="la">contra hostium injurias, et conjugatos invicem conciliare</span>, to
reconcile men and wives, to maintain unity and love; you may try this when
you will, and as you see cause. If none of all these means and cautions
will take place, I know not what remedy to prescribe, or whither such
persons may go for ease, except they can get into the same <a href="#note6297">[6297]</a>Turkey
paradise, <q>Where they shall have as many fair wives as they will
themselves, with clear eyes, and such as look on none but their own
husbands,</q> no fear, no danger of being cuckolds; or else I would have them
observe that strict rule of <a href="#note6298">[6298]</a>Alphonsus, to marry a deaf and dumb man to
a blind woman. If this will not help, let them, to prevent the worst,
consult with an <a href="#note6299">[6299]</a>astrologer, and see whether the significators in her
horoscope agree with his, that they be not <span lang="la">in signis et partibus odiose
intuentibus aut imperantibus, sed mutuo et amice antisciis et
obedientibus</span>, otherwise (as they hold) there will be intolerable enmities
between them: or else get them <span lang="la">sigillum veneris</span>, a characteristical seal
stamped in the day and hour of Venus, when she is fortunate, with such and
such set words and charms, which Villanovanus and Leo Suavius prescribe,
<span lang="la">ex sigillis magicis Salomonis, Hermetis, Raguelis</span>, &amp;c., with many such,
which Alexis, Albertus, and some of our natural magicians put upon us: <span lang="la">ut
mulier cum aliquo adulterare non possit, incide de capillis ejus</span>, &amp;c., and
he shall surely be gracious in all women's eyes, and never suspect or
disagree with his own wife so long as he wears it. If this course be not
approved, and other remedies may not be had, they must in the last place
sue for a divorce; but that is somewhat difficult to effect, and not all
out so fit. For as Felisacus in his tract <span class="cite">de justa uxore</span> urgeth, if that
law of Constantine the Great, or that of Theodosius and Valentinian,
concerning divorce, were in use in our times, <span lang="la">innumeras propemodum viduas
haberemus, et coelibes viros</span>, we should have almost no married couples
left. Try therefore those former remedies; or as Tertullian reports of
Democritus, that put out his eyes, <a href="#note6300">[6300]</a>because he could not look upon a
woman without lust, and was much troubled to see that which he might not
enjoy; let him make himself blind, and so he shall avoid that care and
molestation of watching his wife. One other sovereign remedy I could
repeat, an especial antidote against jealousy, an excellent cure, but I am
not now disposed to tell it, not that like a covetous empiric I conceal it
for any gain, but some other reasons, I am not willing to publish it: if
you be very desirous to know it, when I meet you next I will peradventure
tell you what it is in your ear. This is the best counsel I can give; which
he that hath need of, as occasion serves, may apply unto himself. In the
mean time,&mdash;<span lang="la">dii talem terris avertite pestem</span>, <a href="#note6301">[6301]</a>as the proverb is,
from heresy, jealousy and frenzy, good Lord deliver us.

<p>That there is such a distinct species of love melancholy, no man hath ever
yet doubted: but whether this subdivision of <a href="#note6302">[6302]</a>Religious Melancholy be
warrantable, it may be controverted.

</div>
I have no pattern to follow as in some of the rest, no man to imitate. No
physician hath as yet distinctly written of it as of the other; all
acknowledge it a most notable symptom, some a cause, but few a species or
kind. <a href="#note6304">[6304]</a>Areteus, Alexander, Rhasis, Avicenna, and most of our late
writers, as Gordonius, Fuchsius, Plater, Bruel, Montaltus, &amp;c. repeat it as
a symptom. <a href="#note6305">[6305]</a>Some seem to be inspired of the Holy Ghost, some take upon
them to be prophets, some are addicted to new opinions, some foretell
strange things, <span lang="la">de statu mundi et Antichristi</span>, saith Gordonius. Some will
prophesy of the end of the world to a day almost, and the fall of the
Antichrist, as they have been addicted or brought up; for so melancholy
works with them, as <a href="#note6306">[6306]</a>Laurentius holds. If they have been precisely
given, all their meditations tend that way, and in conclusion produce
strange effects, the humour imprints symptoms according to their several
inclinations and conditions, which makes <a href="#note6307">[6307]</a>Guianerius and <a href="#note6308">[6308]</a>Felix
Plater put too much devotion, blind zeal, fear of eternal punishment, and
that last judgment for a cause of those enthusiastics and desperate persons:
but some do not obscurely make a distinct species of it, dividing love
melancholy into that whose object is women; and into the other whose object
is God. Plato, in <span class="cite">Convivio</span>, makes mention of two distinct furies; and
amongst our neoterics, Hercules de Saxonia <span class="cite">lib. 1. pract. med. cap. 16.
cap. de Melanch.</span> doth expressly treat of it in a distinct species. <a href="#note6309">[6309]</a>
<q>Love melancholy</q> (saith he) <q>is twofold; the first is that (to which
peradventure some will not vouchsafe this name or species of melancholy)
affection of those which put God for their object, and are altogether about
prayer, fasting, &amp;c., the other about women.</q> Peter Forestus in his
observations delivereth as much in the same words: and Felix Platerus <span class="cite">de
mentis alienat. cap. 3.</span> <span lang="la">frequentissima est ejus species, in qua curanda
saepissime multum fui impeditus</span>; 'tis a frequent disease; and they have a
ground of what they say, forth of Areteus and Plato. <a href="#note6310">[6310]</a>Areteus, an old
author, in his third book <span class="cite">cap. 6.</span> doth so divide love melancholy, and
derives this second from the first, which comes by inspiration or
otherwise. <a href="#note6311">[6311]</a>Plato in his Phaedrus hath these words, <q>Apollo's priests in
Delphos, and at Dodona, in their fury do many pretty feats, and benefit the
Greeks, but never in their right wits.</q> He makes them all mad, as well he
might; and he that shall but consider that superstition of old, those
prodigious effects of it (as in its place I will shew the several furies of
our fatidici dii, pythonissas, sibyls, enthusiasts, pseudoprophets,
heretics, and schismatics in these our latter ages) shall instantly
confess, that all the world again cannot afford so much matter of madness,
so many stupendous symptoms, as superstition, heresy, schism have brought
out: that this species alone may be paralleled to all the former, has a
greater latitude, and more miraculous effects; that it more besots and
infatuates men, than any other above named whatsoever, does more harm,
works more disquietness to mankind, and has more crucified the souls of
mortal men (such hath been the devil's craft) than wars, plagues,
sicknesses, dearth, famine, and all the rest.

<p>Give me but a little leave, and I will set before your eyes in brief a
stupendous, vast, infinite ocean of incredible madness and folly: a sea
full of shelves and rocks, sands, gulfs, euripes and contrary tides, full
of fearful monsters, uncouth shapes, roaring waves, tempests, and siren
calms, halcyonian seas, unspeakable misery, such comedies and tragedies,
such absurd and ridiculous, feral and lamentable fits, that I know not
whether they are more to be pitied or derided, or may be believed, but that
we daily see the same still practised in our days, fresh examples, <span lang="la">nova
novitia</span>, fresh objects of misery and madness, in this kind that are still
represented unto us, abroad, at home, in the midst of us, in our bosoms.

<p>But before I can come to treat of these several errors and obliquities,
their causes, symptoms, affections, &amp;c., I must say something necessarily
of the object of this love, God himself, what this love is, how it
allureth, whence it proceeds, and (which is the cause of all our miseries)
how we mistake, wander and swerve from it.

<p>Amongst all those divine attributes that God doth vindicate to himself,
eternity, omnipotency, immutability, wisdom, majesty, justice, mercy, &amp;c.,
his <a href="#note6312">[6312]</a>beauty is not the least, one thing, saith David, have I desired of
the Lord, and that I will still desire, to behold the beauty of the Lord,
<span class="bibcite">Psal. xxvii. 4.</span> And out of Sion, which is the perfection of beauty, hath
God shined, <span class="bibcite">Psal. 1. 2.</span> All other creatures are fair, I confess, and many
other objects do much enamour us, a fair house, a fair horse, a comely
person. <a href="#note6313">[6313]</a><q>I am amazed,</q> saith Austin, <q>when 1 look up to heaven and
behold the beauty of the stars, the beauty of angels, principalities,
powers, who can express it? who can sufficiently commend, or set out this
beauty which appears in us? so fair a body, so fair a face, eyes, nose,
cheeks, chin, brows, all fair and lovely to behold; besides the beauty of
the soul which cannot be discerned. If we so labour and be so much affected
with the comeliness of creatures, how should we be ravished with that
admirable lustre of God himself?</q> If ordinary beauty have such a
prerogative and power, and what is amiable and fair, to draw the eyes and
ears, hearts and affections of all spectators unto it, to move, win,
entice, allure: how shall this divine form ravish our souls, which is the
fountain and quintessence of all beauty? <span lang="la">Coelum pulchrum, sed pulchrior
coeli fabricator</span>; if heaven be so fair, the sun so fair, how much fairer
shall he be, that made them fair? <q>For by the greatness and beauty of the
creatures, proportionally, the maker of them is seen,</q> <span class="bibcite">Wisd. xiii. 5.</span> If
there be such pleasure in beholding a beautiful person alone, and as a
plausible sermon, he so much affect us, what shall this beauty of God
himself, that is infinitely fairer than all creatures, men, angels, &amp;c. <a href="#note6314">[6314]</a>
<span lang="la">Omnis pulchritudo florem, hominum, angelorum, et rerum omnium
pulcherrimarum ad Dei pulchritudinem collata, nox est et tenebrae</span>, all
other beauties are night itself, mere darkness to this our inexplicable,
incomprehensible, unspeakable, eternal, infinite, admirable and divine
beauty. This lustre, <span lang="la">pulchritudo omnium pulcherrima.</span> This beauty and <a href="#note6315">[6315]</a>
<q>splendour of the divine Majesty,</q> is it that draws all creatures to it, to
seek it, love, admire, and adore it; and those heathens, pagans,
philosophers, out of those relics they have yet left of God's image, are so
far forth incensed, as not only to acknowledge a God; but, though after
their own inventions, to stand in admiration of his bounty, goodness, to
adore and seek him; the magnificence and structure of the world itself, and
beauty of all his creatures, his goodness, providence, protection,
enforceth them to love him, seek him, fear him, though a wrong way to adore
him: but for us that are Christians, regenerate, that are his adopted sons,
illuminated by his word, having the eyes of our hearts and understandings
opened; how fairly doth he offer and expose himself? <span lang="la">Ambit nos Deus</span>
(Austin saith) <span lang="la">donis et forma sua</span>, he woos us by his beauty, gifts,
promises, to come unto him; <a href="#note6316">[6316]</a><q>the whole Scripture is a message, an
exhortation, a love letter to this purpose;</q> to incite us, and invite us,
<a href="#note6317">[6317]</a>God's epistle, as Gregory calls it, to his creatures. He sets out his
son and his church in that epithalamium or mystical song of Solomon, to
enamour us the more, comparing his head <q>to fine gold, his locks curled and
black as a raven,</q> <span class="bibcite">Cant. iv. 5.</span> <q>his eyes like doves on rivers of waters,
washed with milk, his lips as lilies, drooping down pure juice, his hands
as rings of gold set with chrysolite: and his church to a vineyard, a
garden enclosed, a fountain of living waters, an orchard of pomegranates,
with sweet scents of saffron, spike, calamus and cinnamon, and all the
trees of incense, as the chief spices, the fairest amongst women, no spot
in her, <a href="#note6318">[6318]</a>his sister, his spouse, undefiled, the only daughter of her
mother, dear unto her, fair as the moon, pure as the sun, looking out as
the morning;</q> that by these figures, that glass, these spiritual eyes of
contemplation, we might perceive some resemblance of his beauty, the love
between his church and him. And so in the <span class="bibcite">xlv. Psalm</span> this beauty of his
church is compared to a <q>queen in a vesture of gold of Ophir, embroidered
raiment of needlework, that the king might take pleasure in her beauty.</q> To
incense us further yet, <a href="#note6319">[6319]</a>John, in his apocalypse, makes a description of
that heavenly Jerusalem, the beauty, of it, and in it the maker of it;
<q>Likening it to a city of pure gold, like unto clear glass, shining and
garnished with all manner of precious stones, having no need of sun or
moon: for the lamb is the light of it, the glory of God doth illuminate it:
to give us to understand the infinite glory, beauty and happiness of it.</q>
Not that it is no fairer than these creatures to which it is compared, but
that this vision of his, this lustre of his divine majesty, cannot
otherwise be expressed to our apprehensions, <q>no tongue can tell, no heart
can conceive it,</q> as Paul saith. Moses himself, <span class="bibcite">Exod. xxxiii. 18.</span> when he
desired to see God in his glory, was answered that he might not endure it,
no man could see his face and live. <span lang="la">Sensibile forte destruit sensum</span>, a
strong object overcometh the sight, according to that axiom in philosophy:
<span lang="la">fulgorem solis ferre non potes, multo magis creatoris</span>; if thou canst not
endure the sunbeams, how canst thou endure that fulgor and brightness of
him that made the sun? The sun itself and all that we can imagine, are but
shadows of it, 'tis <span lang="la">visio praecellens</span>, as <a href="#note6320">[6320]</a>Austin calls it, the
quintessence of beauty this, <q>which far exceeds the beauty of heavens, sun
and moon, stars, angels, gold and silver, woods, fair fields, and
whatsoever is pleasant to behold.</q> All those other beauties fail, vary, are
subject to corruption, to loathing; <a href="#note6321">[6321]</a><q>But this is an immortal vision, a
divine beauty, an immortal love, an indefatigable love and beauty, with
sight of which we shall never be tired nor wearied, but still the more we
see the more we shall covet him.</q> <a href="#note6322">[6322]</a><q>For as one saith, where this vision
is, there is absolute beauty; and where is that beauty, from the same
fountain comes all pleasure and happiness; neither can beauty, pleasure,
happiness, be separated from his vision or sight, or his vision, from
beauty, pleasure, happiness.</q> In this life we have but a glimpse of this
beauty and happiness: we shall hereafter, as John saith, see him as he is:
thine eyes, as Isaiah promiseth, <span class="bibcite">xxxiii. 17.</span> <q>shall behold the king in his
glory,</q> then shall we be perfectly enamoured, have a full fruition of it,
desire, <a href="#note6323">[6323]</a>behold and love him alone as the most amiable and fairest
object, or <span lang="la">summum bonum</span>, or chiefest good.

<p>This likewise should we now have done, had not our will been corrupted; and
as we are enjoined to love God with all our heart, and all our soul: for to
that end were we born, to love this object, as <a href="#note6324">[6324]</a>Melancthon discourseth,
and to enjoy it. <q>And him our will would have loved and sought alone as our
<span lang="la">summum bonum</span>, or principal good, and all other good things for God's
sake: and nature, as she proceeded from it, would have sought this
fountain; but in this infirmity of human nature this order is disturbed,
our love is corrupt:</q> and a man is like that monster in <a href="#note6325">[6325]</a>Plato,
composed of a Scylla, a lion and a man; we are carried away headlong with
the torrent of our affections: the world, and that infinite variety of
pleasing objects in it, do so allure and enamour us, that we cannot so much
as look towards God, seek him, or think on him as we should: we cannot,
saith Austin, <span class="cite">Rempub.</span> <span lang="la">coelestem cogitare</span>, we cannot contain ourselves
from them, their sweetness is so pleasing to us. Marriage, saith <a href="#note6326">[6326]</a>
Gualter, detains many; <q>a thing in itself laudable, good and necessary, but
many, deceived and carried away with the blind love of it, have quite laid
aside the love of God, and desire of his glory. Meat and drink hath
overcome as many, whilst they rather strive to please, satisfy their guts
and belly, than to serve God and nature.</q> Some are so busied about
merchandise to get money, they lose their own souls, whilst covetously
carried, and with an insatiable desire of gain, they forget God; as much we
may say of honour, leagues, friendships, health, wealth, and all other
profits or pleasures in this life whatsoever. <a href="#note6327">[6327]</a><q>In this world there be
so many beautiful objects, splendours and brightness of gold, majesty of
glory, assistance of friends, fair promises, smooth words, victories,
triumphs, and such an infinite company of pleasing beauties to allure us,
and draw us from God, that we cannot look after him.</q> And this is it which
Christ himself, those prophets and apostles so much thundered against, <span class="bibcite">1
John, xvii. 15</span>, dehort us from; <q>love not the world, nor the things that
are in the world: if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not
in him,</q> <span class="bibcite">16.</span> <q>For all that is in the world, as lust of the flesh, the lust of
the eyes, and pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world: and
the world passeth away and the lust thereof; but he that fulfilleth the
will of God abideth for ever. No man, saith our Saviour, can serve two
masters, but he must love the one and hate the other,</q> &amp;c., <span lang="la">bonos vel
malos mores, boni vel mali faciunt amores</span>, Austin well infers: and this is
that which all the fathers inculcate. He cannot (<a href="#note6328">[6328]</a>Austin admonisheth) be
God's friend, that is delighted with the pleasures of the world: <q>make
clean thine heart, purify thine heart; if thou wilt see this beauty,
prepare thyself for it. It is the eye of contemplation by which we must
behold it, the wing of meditation which lifts us up and rears our souls
with the motion of our hearts, and sweetness of contemplation:</q> so saith
Gregory cited by <a href="#note6329">[6329]</a>Bonaventure. And as <a href="#note6330">[6330]</a>Philo Judeus seconds him, <q>he
that loves God, will soar aloft and take him wings; and leaving the earth
fly up to heaven, wander with sun and moon, stars, and that heavenly troop,
God himself being his guide.</q> If we desire to see him, we must lay aside
all vain objects, which detain us and dazzle our eyes, and as <a href="#note6331">[6331]</a>Ficinus
adviseth us, <q>get us solar eyes, spectacles as they that look on the sun:
to see this divine beauty, lay aside all material objects, all sense, and
then thou shalt see him as he is.</q> Thou covetous wretch, as <a href="#note6332">[6332]</a>Austin
expostulates, <q>why dost thou stand gaping on this dross, muck-hills, filthy
excrements? behold a far fairer object, God himself woos thee; behold him,
enjoy him, he is sick for love.</q> <span class="bibcite">Cant. v.</span> he invites thee to his sight, to
come into his fair garden, to eat and drink with him, to be merry with him,
to enjoy his presence for ever. <a href="#note6333">[6333]</a>Wisdom cries out in the streets
besides the gates, in the top of high places, before the city, at the entry
of the door, and bids them give ear to her instruction, which is better
than gold or precious stones; no pleasures can be compared to it: leave all
then and follow her, <span lang="la">vos exhortor o amici et obsecro.</span> In. <a href="#note6334">[6334]</a>Ficinus's
words, <q>I exhort and beseech you, that you would embrace and follow this
divine love with all your hearts and abilities, by all offices and
endeavours make this so loving God propitious unto you.</q> For whom alone,
saith <a href="#note6335">[6335]</a>Plotinus, <q>we must forsake the kingdoms and empires of the whole
earth, sea, land, and air, if we desire to be engrafted into him, leave all
and follow him.</q>

<p>Now, forasmuch as this love of God is a habit infused of God, as <a href="#note6336">[6336]</a>
Thomas holds, <span class="cite">l. 2. quaest. 23.</span> <q>by which a man is inclined to love God
above all, and his neighbour as himself,</q> we must pray to God that he will
open our eyes, make clear our hearts, that we may be capable of his
glorious rays, and perform those duties that he requires of us, <span class="bibcite">Deut. vi.</span>
and <span class="bibcite">Josh. xxiii.</span> <q>to love God above all, and our neighbour as ourself, to
keep his commandments.</q> <q>In this we know,</q> saith John, <span class="bibcite">c. v. 2</span>, <q>we love the
children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.</q> <q>This is the
love of God, that we keep his commandments; he that loveth not, knoweth not
God, for God is love,</q> <span class="bibcite">cap. iv. 8</span>, <q>and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth
in God, and God in him;</q> for love pre-supposeth knowledge, faith, hope, and
unites us to God himself, as <a href="#note6337">[6337]</a>Leon Hebreus delivereth unto us, and is
accompanied with the fear of God, humility, meekness, patience, all those
virtues, and charity itself. For if we love God, we shall love our
neighbour, and perform the duties which are required at our hands, to which
we are exhorted, <span class="bibcite">1 Cor. xv. 4, 5</span>; <span class="bibcite">Ephes. iv.</span>; <span class="bibcite">Colos. iii.</span>; <span class="bibcite">Rom. xii.</span> We
shall not be envious or puffed up, or boast, disdain, think evil, or be
provoked to anger, <q>but suffer all things; endeavour to keep the unity of
the spirit in the bond of peace.</q> Forbear one another, forgive one another,
clothe the naked, visit the sick, and perform all those works of mercy,
which <a href="#note6338">[6338]</a>Clemens Alexandrinus calls <span lang="la">amoris et amicitiae, impletionem et
extentionem</span>, the extent and complement of love; and that not for fear or
worldly respects, but <span lang="la">ordine ad Deum</span>, for the love of God himself. This
we shall do if we be truly enamoured; but we come short in both, we neither
love God nor our neighbour as we should. Our love in spiritual things is
too <a href="#note6339">[6339]</a>defective, in worldly things too excessive, there is a jar in
both. We love the world too much; God too little; our neighbour not at all,
or for our own ends. <span lang="la">Vulgus amicitias utilitate probat.</span> <q>The chief thing
we respect is our commodity;</q> and what we do is for fear of worldly
punishment, for vainglory, praise of men, fashion, and such by respects,
not for God's sake. We neither know God aright, nor seek, love or worship
him as we should. And for these defects, we involve ourselves into a
multitude of errors, we swerve from this true love and worship of God:
which is a cause unto us of unspeakable miseries; running into both
extremes, we become fools, madmen, without sense, as now in the next place
1 will show you.

<p>The parties affected are innumerable almost, and scattered over the face of
the earth, far and near, and so have been in all precedent ages, from the
beginning of the world to these times, of all sorts and conditions. For
method's sake I will reduce them to a twofold division, according to those
two extremes of excess and defect, impiety and superstition, idolatry and
atheism. Not that there is any excess of divine worship or love of God;
that cannot be, we cannot love God too much, or do our duty as we ought, as
Papists hold, or have any perfection in this life, much less supererogate:
when we have all done, we are unprofitable servants. But because we do
<span lang="la">aliud agere</span>, zealous without knowledge, and too solicitous about that
which is not necessary, busying ourselves about impertinent, needless,
idle, and vain ceremonies, <span lang="la">populo ut placerent</span>, as the Jews did about
sacrifices, oblations, offerings, incense, new moons, feasts, &amp;c., but
Isaiah taxeth them, <span class="bibcite">i. 12</span>, <q>who required this at your hands?</q> We have too
great opinion of our own worth, that we can satisfy the law: and do more
than is required at our hands, by performing those evangelical counsels,
and such works of supererogation, merit for others, which Bellarmine,
Gregory de Valentia, all their Jesuits and champions defend, that if God
should deal in rigour with them, some of their Franciscans and Dominicans
are so pure, that nothing could be objected to them. Some of us again are
too dear, as we think, more divine and sanctified than others, of a better
mettle, greater gifts, and with that proud Pharisee, contemn others in
respect of ourselves, we are better Christians, better learned, choice
spirits, inspired, know more, have special revelation, perceive God's
secrets, and thereupon presume, say and do that many times which is not
befitting to be said or done. Of this number are all superstitious
idolaters, ethnics, Mahometans, Jews, heretics, <a href="#note6340">[6340]</a>enthusiasts,
divinators, prophets, sectaries, and schismatics. Zanchius reduceth such
infidels to four chief sects; but I will insist and follow mine own
intended method: all which with many other curious persons, monks, hermits,
&amp;c., may be ranged in this extreme, and fight under this superstitious
banner, with those rude idiots, and infinite swarms of people that are
seduced by them. In the other extreme or in defect, march those impious
epicures, libertines, atheists, hypocrites, infidels, worldly, secure,
impenitent, unthankful, and carnal-minded men, that attribute all to
natural causes, that will acknowledge no supreme power; that have
cauterised consciences, or live in a reprobate sense; or such desperate
persons as are too distrustful of his mercies. Of these there be many
subdivisions, diverse degrees of madness and folly, some more than other,
as shall be shown in the symptoms: and yet all miserably out, perplexed,
doting, and beside themselves for religion's sake. For as <a href="#note6341">[6341]</a>Zanchy well
distinguished, and all the world knows religion is twofold, true or false;
false is that vain superstition of idolaters, such as were of old, Greeks,
Romans, present Mahometans, &amp;c. <span lang="la">Timorem deorum inanem</span>, <a href="#note6342">[6342]</a>Tully could
term it; or as Zanchy defines it, <span lang="la">Ubi falsi dii, aut falso cullu colitur
Deus</span>, when false gods, or that God is falsely worshipped. And 'tis a
miserable plague, a torture of the soul, a mere madness, <span lang="la">Religiosa
insania</span>, <a href="#note6343">[6343]</a>Meteran calls it, or <span lang="la">insanus error</span>, as <a href="#note6344">[6344]</a>Seneca, a
frantic error; or as Austin, <span lang="la">Insanus animi morbus</span>, a furious disease of
the soul; <span lang="la">insania omnium insanissima</span>, a quintessence of madness; <a href="#note6345">[6345]</a>for
he that is superstitious can never be quiet. 'Tis proper to man alone, <span lang="la">uni
superbia, avaritia, superstitio</span>, saith Plin. <span class="cite">lib. 7. cap. 1.</span> <span lang="la">atque
etiam post saevit de futuro</span>, which wrings his soul for the present, and to
come: the greatest misery belongs to mankind, a perpetual servitude, a
slavery, <a href="#note6346">[6346]</a><span lang="la">Ex timore timor</span>, a heavy yoke, the seal of damnation, an
intolerable burden. They that are superstitious are still fearing,
suspecting, vexing themselves with auguries, prodigies, false tales,
dreams, idle, vain works, unprofitable labours, as <a href="#note6347">[6347]</a>Boterus observes,
<span lang="la">cura mentis ancipite versantur</span>: enemies to God and to themselves. In a
word, as Seneca concludes, <span lang="la">Religio Deum colit, superstitio destruit</span>,
superstition destroys, but true religion honours God. True religion, <span lang="la">ubi
verus Deus vere colitur</span>, where the true God is truly worshipped, is the
way to heaven, the mother of virtues, love, fear, devotion, obedience,
knowledge, &amp;c. It rears the dejected soul of man, and amidst so many cares,
miseries, persecutions, which this world affords, it is a sole ease, an
unspeakable comfort, a sweet reposal, <span lang="la">Jugum suave, et leve</span>, a light yoke,
an anchor, and a haven. It adds courage, boldness, and begets generous
spirits: although tyrants rage, persecute, and that bloody Lictor or
sergeant be ready to martyr them, <span lang="la">aut lita, aut morere</span>, (as in those
persecutions of the primitive Church, it was put in practice, as you may
read in Eusebius and others) though enemies be now ready to invade, and all
in an uproar, <a href="#note6348">[6348]</a><span lang="la">Si fractus illabatur orbis, impavidos ferient ruinae</span>,
though heaven should fall on his head, he would not be dismayed. But as a
good Christian prince once made answer to a menacing Turk, <span lang="la">facile
scelerata hominum arma contemnit, qui del praesidio tutus est</span>: or as <a href="#note6349">[6349]</a>
Phalaris writ to Alexander in a wrong cause, he nor any other enemy could
terrify him, for that he trusted in God. <span lang="la">Si Deus nobiscum, quis contra
nos</span>? In all calamities, persecutions whatsoever, as David did, <span class="bibcite">2 Sam. ii.
22</span>, he will sing with him, <q>the Lord is my rock, my fortress, my strength,
my refuge, the tower and horn of my salvation,</q> &amp;c. In all troubles and
adversities, <span class="bibcite">Psal. xlvi. 1.</span> <q>God is my hope and help, still ready to be
found, I will not therefore fear,</q> &amp;c., 'tis a fear expelling fear; he hath
peace of conscience, and is full of hope, which is (saith <a href="#note6350">[6350]</a>Austin)
<span lang="la">vita vitae mortalis</span>, the life of this our mortal life, hope of
immortality, the sole comfort of our misery: otherwise, as Paul saith, we
of all others were most wretched, but this makes us happy, counterpoising
our hearts in all miseries; superstition torments, and is from the devil,
the author of lies; but this is from God himself, as Lucian, that
Antiochian priest, made his divine confession in <a href="#note6351">[6351]</a>Eusebius, <span lang="la">Auctor
nobis de Deo Deus est</span>, God is the author of our religion himself, his word
is our rule, a lantern to us, dictated by the Holy Ghost, he plays upon our
hearts as many harpstrings, and we are his temples, he dwelleth in us, and
we in him.

<p>The part affected of superstition, is the brain, heart, will,
understanding, soul itself, and all the faculties of it, <span lang="la">totum
compositum</span>, all is mad and dotes: now for the extent, as I say, the world
itself is the subject of it, (to omit that grand sin of atheism,) all times
have been misaffected, past, present, <q>there is not one that doth good, no
not one, from the prophet to the priest, &amp;c.</q> A lamentable thing it is to
consider, how many myriads of men this idolatry and superstition (for that
comprehends all) hath infatuated in all ages, besotted by this blind zeal,
which is religion's ape, religion's bastard, religion's shadow, false
glass. For where God hath a temple, the devil will have a chapel: where God
hath sacrifices, the devil will have his oblations: where God hath
ceremonies, the devil will have his traditions: where there is any
religion, the devil will plant superstition; and 'tis a pitiful sight to
behold and read, what tortures, miseries, it hath procured, what slaughter
of souls it hath made, how it rageth amongst those old Persians, Syrians,
Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Tuscans, Gauls, Germans, Britons, &amp;c. <span lang="la">Britannia
jam hodie celebrat tam attonite</span>, saith <a href="#note6352">[6352]</a>Pliny, <span lang="la">tantis ceremoniis</span>
(speaking of superstition) <span lang="la">ut dedisse Persis videri possit.</span> The Britons
are so stupendly superstitious in their ceremonies, that they go beyond
those Persians. He that shall but read in Pausanias alone, those gods,
temples, altars, idols, statues, so curiously made with such infinite cost
and charge, amongst those old Greeks, such multitudes of them and frequent
varieties, as <a href="#note6353">[6353]</a>Gerbelius truly observes, may stand amazed, and never
enough wonder at it; and thank God withal, that by the light of the Gospel,
we are so happily freed from that slavish idolatry in these our days. But
heretofore, almost in all countries, in all places, superstition hath
blinded the hearts of men; in all ages what a small portion hath the true
church ever been! <span lang="la">Divisum imperium cum Jove Daemon habet.</span> <a href="#note6354">[6354]</a>The
patriarchs and their families, the Israelites a handful in respect, Christ
and his apostles, and not all of them, neither. Into what straits hath it
been compinged, a little flock! how hath superstition on the other side
dilated herself, error, ignorance, barbarism, folly, madness, deceived,
triumphed, and insulted over the most wise discreet, and understanding man,
philosophers, dynasts, monarchs, all were involved and overshadowed in this
mist, in more than Cimmerian darkness. <a href="#note6355">[6355]</a><span lang="la">Adeo ignara superstitio mentes
hominum depravat, et nonnunquam sapientum animos transversos agit.</span> At this
present, <span lang="la">quota pars!</span> How small a part is truly religious! How little in
respect! Divide the world into six parts, and one, or not so much, as
Christians; idolaters and Mahometans possess almost Asia, Africa, America,
Magellanica. The kings of China, great Cham, Siam, and Borneo, Pegu,
Deccan, Narsinga, Japan, &amp;c., are gentiles, idolaters, and many other petty
princes in Asia, Monomotopa, Congo, and I know not how many Negro princes
in Africa, all Terra Australis incognita most of America pagans, differing
all in their several superstitions; and yet all idolaters. The Mahometans
extend themselves over the great Turk's dominions in Europe, Africa, Asia,
to the Xeriffes in Barbary, and its territories in Fez, Sus, Morocco, &amp;c.
The Tartar, the great Mogor, the Sophy of Persia, with most of their
dominions and subjects, are at this day Mahometans. See how the devil
rageth: those at odds, or differing among themselves, some for <a href="#note6356">[6356]</a>Ali,
some Enbocar, for Acmor, and Ozimen, those four doctors, Mahomet's
successors, and are subdivided into seventy-two inferior sects, as <a href="#note6357">[6357]</a>Leo
Afer reports. The Jews, as a company of vagabonds, are scattered over all
parts; whose story, present estate, progress from time to time, is fully
set down by <a href="#note6358">[6358]</a>Mr. Thomas Jackson, Doctor of Divinity, in his comment on
the creed. A fifth part of the world, and hardly that, now professeth
CHRIST, but so inlarded and interlaced with several superstitions, that
there is scarce a sound part to be found, or any agreement amongst them.
Presbyter John, in Africa, lord of those Abyssinians, or Ethiopians, is by
his profession a Christian, but so different from us, with such new
absurdities and ceremonies, such liberty, such a mixture of idolatry and
paganism, <a href="#note6359">[6359]</a>that they keep little more than a bare title of
Christianity. They suffer polygamy, circumcision, stupend fastings, divorce
as they will themselves, &amp;c., and as the papists call on the Virgin Mary,
so do they on Thomas Didymus before Christ. <a href="#note6360">[6360]</a>The Greek or Eastern Church
is rent from this of the West, and as they have four chief patriarchs, so
have they four subdivisions, besides those Nestorians, Jacobins, Syrians,
Armenians, Georgians, &amp;c., scattered over Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, &amp;c.,
Greece, Walachia, Circassia, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Albania, Illyricum,
Sclavonia, Croatia, Thrace, Servia, Rascia, and a sprinkling amongst the
Tartars, the Russians, Muscovites, and most of that great duke's (czar's)
subjects, are part of the Greek Church, and still Christians: but as
<a href="#note6361">[6361]</a>one saith, <span lang="la">temporis successu multas illi addiderunt superstitiones.</span>
In process of time they have added so many superstitions, they be rather
semi-Christians than otherwise. That which remains is the Western Church
with us in Europe, but so eclipsed with several schisms, heresies and
superstitions, that one knows not where to find it. The papists have Italy,
Spain, Savoy, part of Germany, France, Poland, and a sprinkling in the rest
of Europe. In America, they hold all that which Spaniards inhabit, Hispania
Nova, Castella Aurea, Peru, &amp;c. In the East Indies, the Philippines, some
small holds about Goa, Malacca, Zelan, Ormus, &amp;c., which the Portuguese got
not long since, and those land-leaping Jesuits have essayed in China,
Japan, as appears by their yearly letters; in Africa they have Melinda,
Quiloa, Mombaze, &amp;c., and some few towns, they drive out one superstition
with another. Poland is a receptacle of all religions, where Samosetans,
Socinians, Photinians (now protected in Transylvania and Poland), Arians,
Anabaptists are to be found, as well as in some German cities. Scandia is
Christian, but <a href="#note6362">[6362]</a>Damianus A-Goes, the Portugal knight, complains, so
mixed with magic, pagan rites and ceremonies, they may be as well counted
idolaters: what Tacitus formerly said of a like nation, is verified in
them, <a href="#note6363">[6363]</a><q>A people subject to superstition, contrary to religion.</q> And
some of them as about Lapland and the Pilapians, the devil's possession to
this day, <span lang="la">Misera haec gens</span> (saith mine <a href="#note6364">[6364]</a>author) <span lang="la">Satanae hactenus
possessio,&mdash;et quod maxime mirandum et dolendum</span>, and which is to be
admired and pitied; if any of them be baptised, which the kings of Sweden
much labour, they die within seven or nine days after, and for that cause
they will hardly be brought to Christianity, but worship still the devil,
who daily appears to them. In their idolatrous courses, <span lang="la">Gandentibus diis
patriis, quos religiose colunt</span>, &amp;c. Yet are they very superstitious, like
our wild Irish: though they of the better note, the kings of Denmark and
Sweden themselves, that govern them, be Lutherans; the remnant are
Calvinists, Lutherans, in Germany equally mixed. And yet the emperor
himself, dukes of Lorraine, Bavaria, and the princes, electors, are most
part professed papists. And though some part of France and Ireland, Great
Britain, half the cantons in Switzerland, and the Low Countries, be
Calvinists, more defecate than the rest, yet at odds amongst themselves,
not free from superstition. And which <a href="#note6365">[6365]</a>Brochard, the monk, in his
description of the Holy Land, after he had censured the Greek church, and
showed their errors, concluded at last, <span lang="la">Faxit Deus ne Latinis multa
irrepserint stultifies</span>, I say God grant there be no fopperies in our
church. As a dam of water stopped in one place breaks out into another, so
doth superstition. I say nothing of Anabaptists, Socinians, Brownists,
Familists, &amp;c. There is superstition in our prayers, often in our hearing
of sermons, bitter contentions, invectives, persecutions, strange conceits,
besides diversity of opinions, schisms, factions, &amp;c. But as the Lord (<span class="bibcite">Job
xlii. cap. 7. v.</span>) said to Eliphaz, the Temanite, and his two friends,
<q>his wrath was kindled against them, for they had not spoken of him things
that were right:</q> we may justly of these schismatics and heretics, how wise
soever in their own conceits, <span lang="la">non recte loquuntur de Deo</span>, they speak not,
they think not, they write not well of God, and as they ought. And
therefore, <span lang="la">Quid quaeso mi Dorpi</span>, as Erasmus concludes to Dorpius, <span lang="la">hisce
Theologis faciamus, aut quid preceris, nisi forte fidelem medicum, qui
cerebro medeatur</span>? What shall we wish them, but <span lang="la">sanam mentem</span>, and a good
physician? But more of their differences, paradoxes, opinions, mad pranks,
in the symptoms: I now hasten to the causes.

<h4><a name="3.4.1.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Causes of Religious melancholy. From the Devil by miracles, apparitions, oracles. His instruments or factors, politicians, Priests, Impostors, Heretics, blind guides. In them simplicity, fear, blind zeal, ignorance, solitariness, curiosity, pride, vainglory, presumption, &amp;c. his engines, fasting, solitariness, hope, fear, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>We are taught in Holy Scripture, that the <q>Devil rangeth abroad like a
roaring lion, still seeking whom he may devour:</q> and as in several shapes,
so by several engines and devices he goeth about to seduce us; sometimes
he transforms himself into an angel of light; and is so cunning that he is
able, if it were possible, to deceive the very elect. He will be worshipped
as <a href="#note6366">[6366]</a>God himself, and is so adored by the heathen, and esteemed. And in
imitation of that divine power, as <a href="#note6367">[6367]</a>Eusebius observes, <a href="#note6368">[6368]</a>to abuse or
emulate God's glory, as Dandinus adds, he will have all homage, sacrifices,
oblations, and whatsoever else belongs to the worship of God, to be done
likewise unto him, <span lang="la">similis erit altissimo</span>, and by this means infatuates
the world, deludes, entraps, and destroys many a thousand souls. Sometimes
by dreams, visions (as God to Moses by familiar conference), the devil in
several shapes talks with them: in the <a href="#note6369">[6369]</a>Indies it is common, and in
China nothing so familiar as apparitions, inspirations, oracles, by
terrifying them with false prodigies, counterfeit miracles, sending storms,
tempests, diseases, plagues (as of old in Athens there was Apollo,
Alexicacus, Apollo <span lang="gr">&lambda;&#x1F79;&iota;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <span lang="la">pestifer et malorum depulsor</span>),
raising wars, seditions by spectrums, troubling their consciences, driving
them to despair, terrors of mind, intolerable pains; by promises, rewards,
benefits, and fair means, he raiseth such an opinion of his deity and
greatness, that they dare not do otherwise than adore him, do as he will
have them, they dare not offend him. And to compel them more to stand in
awe of him, <a href="#note6370">[6370]</a><q>he sends and cures diseases, disquiets their spirits</q> (as
Cyprian saith), <q>torments and terrifies their souls, to make them adore him:
and all his study, all his endeavour is to divert them from true religion
to superstition: and because he is damned himself, and in an error, he
would have all the world participate of his errors, and be damned with him.</q>
The <span lang="la">primum mobile</span>, therefore, and first mover of all superstition, is the
devil, that great enemy of mankind, the principal agent, who in a thousand
several, shapes, after diverse fashions, with several engines, illusions,
and by several names hath deceived the inhabitants of the earth, in several
places and countries, still rejoicing at their falls. <q>All the world over
before Christ's time, he freely domineered, and held the souls of men in
most slavish subjection</q> (saith <a href="#note6371">[6371]</a>Eusebius) <q>in diverse forms, ceremonies,
and sacrifices, till Christ's coming,</q> as if those devils of the air had
shared the earth amongst them, which the Platonists held for gods
(<a href="#note6372">[6372]</a><span lang="la">Ludus deorum sumus</span>), and were our governors and keepers. In several
places, they had several rites, orders, names, of which read Wierus <span class="cite">de
praestigiis daemonum, lib. 1. cap. 5.</span> <a href="#note6373">[6373]</a>Strozzius Cicogna, and others;
Adonided amongst the Syrians; Adramalech amongst the Capernaites, Asiniae
amongst the Emathites; Astartes with the Sidonians; Astaroth with the
Palestines; Dagon with the Philistines; Tartary with the Hanaei; Melchonis
amongst the Ammonites: Beli the Babylonians; Beelzebub and Baal with the
Samaritans and Moabites; Apis, Isis, and Osiris amongst the Egyptians;
Apollo Pythius at Delphos, Colophon, Ancyra, Cuma, Erythra; Jupiter in
Crete, Venus at Cyprus, Juno at Carthage, Aesculapius at Epidaurus, Diana at
Ephesus, Pallas at Athens, &amp;c. And even in these our days, both in the East
and West Indies, in Tartary, China, Japan, &amp;c., what strange idols, in what
prodigious forms, with what absurd ceremonies are they adored? What strange
sacraments, like ours of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, what goodly
temples, priests, sacrifices they had in America, when the Spaniards first
landed there, let Acosta the Jesuit relate, <span class="cite">lib. 5. cap. 1, 2, 3, 4</span>,
&amp;c., and how the devil imitated the Ark and the children of Israel's coming
out of Egypt; with many such. For as Lipsius well discourseth out of the
doctrine of the Stoics, <span lang="la">maxime cupiunt adorationem hominum</span>, now and of
old, they still and most especially desire to be adored by men. See but
what Vertomannus, <span class="cite">l. 5. c. 2.</span> Marcus Polus, Lerius, Benzo, P. Martyr in
his <span class="cite">Ocean Decades</span>, Acosta, and Mat. Riccius <span class="cite">expedit. Christ. in Sinus,
lib. 1.</span> relate. <a href="#note6374">[6374]</a>Eusebius wonders how that wise city of Athens, and
flourishing kingdoms of Greece, should be so besotted; and we in our times,
how. those witty Chinese, so perspicacious in all other things should be so
gulled, so tortured with superstition, so blind as to worship stocks and
stones. But it is no marvel, when we see all out as great effects amongst
Christians themselves; how are those Anabaptists, Arians, and Papists above
the rest, miserably infatuated! Mars, Jupiter, Apollo, and Aesculapius, have
resigned their interest, names, and offices to Saint George.
<div class="poem" lang="la">

</div>
St. Christopher, and a company of fictitious saints, Venus to the Lady of
Loretto. And as those old Romans had several distinct gods, for divers
offices, persons, places, so have they saints, as <a href="#note6376">[6376]</a>Lavater well observes
out of Lactantius, <span lang="la">mutato nomine tantum</span>, 'tis the same spirit or devil
that deludes them still. The manner how, as I say, is by rewards, promises,
terrors, affrights, punishments. In a word, fair and foul means, hope and
fear. How often hath Jupiter, Apollo, Bacchus, and the rest, sent plagues
in <a href="#note6377">[6377]</a>Greece and Italy, because their sacrifices were neglected?
<div class="poem" lang="la">

to terrify them, to arouse them up, and the like: see but Livy, Dionysius
Halicarnassaeus, Thucydides, Pausanius, Philostratus, <a href="#note6379">[6379]</a>Polybius, before
the battle of Cannae, <span lang="la">prodigiis signis, ostentis, templa cuncta, privates
etiam aedes scatebant.</span> Oeneus reigned in Aetolia, and because he did not
sacrifice to Diana with his other gods (see more in Labanius his Diana),
she sent a wild boar, <span lang="la">insolitae magnitudinis, qui terras et homines misere
depascebatur</span>, to spoil both men and country, which was afterwards killed
by Meleager. So Plutarch in the Life of Lucullus relates, how Mithridates,
king of Pontus, at the siege of Cizicum, with all his navy, was overthrown
by Proserpina, for neglecting of her holy day. She appeared in a vision to
Aristagoras in the night, <span lang="la">Cras inquit tybicinem Lybicum cum tybicine
pontico committam</span> (<q>tomorrow I will cause a contest between a Libyan and
a Pontic minstrel</q>), and the day following this enigma was understood; for
with a great south wind which came from Libya, she quite overwhelmed
Mithridates' army. What prodigies and miracles, dreams, visions,
predictions, apparitions, oracles, have been of old at Delphos, Dodona,
Trophonius' den, at Thebes, and Lebaudia, of Jupiter Ammon in Egypt,
Amphiaraus in Attica, &amp;c.; what strange cures performed by Apollo and
Aesculapius? Juno's image and that of <a href="#note6380">[6380]</a>Fortune spake, <a href="#note6381">[6381]</a>Castor and
Pollux fought in person for the Romans against Hannibal's army, as Pallas,
Mars, Juno, Venus, for Greeks and Trojans, &amp;c. Amongst our pseudo-Catholics
nothing so familiar as such miracles; how many cures done by our lady of
Loretto, at Sichem! of old at our St. Thomas's shrine, &amp;c. <a href="#note6382">[6382]</a>St. Sabine
was seen to fight for Arnulphus, duke of Spoleto. <a href="#note6383">[6383]</a>St. George fought in
person for John the Bastard of Portugal, against the Castilians; St. James
for the Spaniards in America. In the battle of Bannockburn, where Edward
the Second, our English king, was foiled by the Scots, St. Philanus' arm
was seen to fight (if <a href="#note6384">[6384]</a>Hector Boethius doth not impose), that was before
shut up in a silver cap-case; another time, in the same author, St. Magnus
fought for them. Now for visions, revelations, miracles, not only out of
the legend, out of purgatory, but everyday comes news from the Indies, and
at home read the Jesuits' Letters, Ribadineira, Thurselinus, Acosta,
Lippomanus, Xaverius, Ignatius' Lives, &amp;c., and tell me what difference?

<p>His ordinary instruments or factors which he useth, as God himself, did
good kings, lawful magistrates, patriarchs, prophets, to the establishing
of his church, <a href="#note6385">[6385]</a>are politicians, statesmen, priests, heretics, blind
guides, impostors, pseudoprophets, to propagate his superstition. And first
to begin of politicians, it hath ever been a principal axiom with them to
maintain religion or superstition, which they determine of, alter and vary
upon all occasions, as to them seems best, they make religion mere policy,
a cloak, a human invention, <span lang="la">nihil aeque valet ad regendos vulgi animos ac
superstitio</span>, as <a href="#note6386">[6386]</a>Tacitus and <a href="#note6387">[6387]</a>Tully hold. Austin, <span class="cite">l. 4. de
civitat. Dei. c. 9.</span> censures Scaevola saying and acknowledging <span lang="la">expedire
civitates religione falli</span>, that it was a fit thing cities should be
deceived by religion, according to the diverb, <span lang="la">Si mundus vult decipi,
decipiatur</span>, if the world will be gulled, let it be gulled, 'tis good
howsoever to keep it in subjection. 'Tis that <a href="#note6388">[6388]</a>Aristotle and <a href="#note6389">[6389]</a>Plato
inculcate in their politics, <q>Religion neglected, brings plague to the
city, opens a gap to all naughtiness.</q> 'Tis that which all our late
politicians ingeminate. Cromerus, <span class="cite">l. 2. pol. hist.</span> Boterus, <span class="cite">l. 3. de
incrementis urbium.</span> Clapmarius, <span class="cite">l. 2. c. 9. de Arcanis rerump. cap.
4. lib. 2. polit.</span> Captain Machiavel will have a prince by all means to
counterfeit religion, to be superstitious in show at least, to seem to be
devout, frequent holy exercises, honour divines, love the church, affect
priests, as Numa, Lycurgus, and such lawmakers were and did, <span lang="la">non ut his
fidem habeant, sed ut subditos religionis metu facilius in officio
contineant</span>, to keep people in obedience. <a href="#note6390">[6390]</a><span lang="la">Nam naturaliter</span> (as Cardan
writes) <span lang="la">lex Christiana lex est pietatis, justitiae, fidei, simplicitatis</span>,
&amp;c. But this error of his, Innocentius Jentilettus, a French lawyer,
<span class="cite">theorem. 9. comment. 1. de Relig</span>, and Thomas Bozius in his book <span class="cite">de
ruinis gentium et Regnorum</span> have copiously confuted. Many politicians, I
dare not deny, maintain religion as a true means, and sincerely speak of it
without hypocrisy, are truly zealous and religious themselves. Justice and
religion are the two chief props and supporters of a well-governed
commonwealth: but most of them are but Machiavellians, counterfeits only for
political ends; for <span lang="la">solus rex</span> (which Campanella, <span class="cite">cap. 18. atheismi
triumphali</span> observes), as amongst our modern Turks, <span lang="la">reipub. Finis</span>, as
knowing <a href="#note6391">[6391]</a><span lang="la">magnus ejus in animos imperium</span>; and that, as <a href="#note6392">[6392]</a>Sabellicus
delivers, <q>A man without religion, is like a horse without a bridle.</q> No
way better to curb than superstition, to terrify men's consciences, and to
keep them in awe: they make new laws, statutes, invent new religions,
ceremonies, as so many stalking horses, to their ends. <a href="#note6393">[6393]</a><span lang="la">Haec enim
(religio) si falsa sit, dummodo vera credatur, animorum ferociam domat,
libidines coercet, subditos principi obsequentes efficit.</span> <a href="#note6394">[6394]</a>Therefore
(saith <a href="#note6395">[6395]</a>Polybius of Lycurgus), <q>did he maintain ceremonies, not that he
was superstitious himself, but that he had perceived mortal men more apt to
embrace paradoxes than aught else, and durst attempt no evil things for
fear of the gods.</q> This was Zamolcus's stratagem amongst the Thracians,
Numa's plot, when he said he had conference with the nymph Aegeria, and that
of Sertorius with a hart; to get more credit to their decrees, by deriving
them from the gods; or else they did all by divine instinct, which Nicholas
Damascen well observes of Lycurgus, Solon, and Minos, they had their laws
dictated, <span lang="la">monte sacro</span>, by Jupiter himself. So Mahomet referred his new
laws to the <a href="#note6396">[6396]</a>angel Gabriel, by whose direction he gave out they were
made. Caligula in Dion feigned himself to be familiar with Castor and
Pollux, and many such, which kept those Romans under (who, as Machiavel
proves, <span class="cite">lib. 1. disput. cap. 11. et 12.</span> were <span lang="la">Religione maxime moti</span>,
most superstitious): and did curb the people more by this means, than by
force of arms, or severity of human laws. <span lang="la">Sola plebecula eam agnoscebat</span>
(saith Vaninus, <span class="cite">dial. 1. lib. 4. de admirandis naturae arcanis</span>)
speaking of religion, <span lang="la">que facile decipitur, magnates vero et philosophi
nequaquam</span>, your grandees and philosophers had no such conceit, <span lang="la">sed ad
imperii conformationem et amplificationem quam sine praetextu religionis
tueri non poterant</span>; and many thousands in all ages have ever held as much,
Philosophers especially, <span lang="la">animadvertebant hi semper haec esse fabellas,
attamen ob metum publicae potestatis silere cogebantur</span> they were still
silent for fear of laws, &amp;c. To this end that Syrian Phyresides, Pythagoras
his master, broached in the East amongst the heathens, first the
immortality of the soul, as Trismegistus did in Egypt, with a many of
feigned gods. Those French and Briton Druids in the West first taught,
saith <a href="#note6397">[6397]</a>Caesar, <span lang="la">non interire animas</span> (that souls did not die), <q>but
after death to go from one to another, that so they might encourage them to
virtue.</q> 'Twas for a politic end, and to this purpose the old <a href="#note6398">[6398]</a>poets
feigned those elysian fields, their Aeacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus, their
infernal judges, and those Stygian lakes, fiery Phlegethons, Pluto's
kingdom, and variety of torments after death. Those that had done well,
went to the elysian fields, but evil doers to Cocytus, and to that burning
lake of <a href="#note6399">[6399]</a>hell with fire, and brimstone for ever to be tormented. 'Tis
this which <a href="#note6400">[6400]</a>Plato labours for in his Phaedon, <span class="cite">et 9. de rep.</span> The
Turks in their Alcoran, when they set down rewards, and several punishments
for every particular virtue and vice, <a href="#note6401">[6401]</a>when they persuade men, that
they that die in battle shall go directly to heaven, but wicked livers to
eternal torment, and all of all sorts (much like our papistical purgatory),
for a set time shall be tortured in their graves, as appears by that tract
which John Baptista Alfaqui, that Mauritanian priest, now turned Christian,
hath written in his confutation of the Alcoran. After a man's death two
black angels, Nunquir and Nequir (so they call them) come to him to his
grave and punish him for his precedent sins; if he lived well, they torture
him the less; if ill, <span lang="la">per indesinentes cruciatus ad diem fudicii</span>, they
incessantly punish him to the day of judgment, <span lang="la">Nemo viventium qui ad horum
mentionem non totus horret et contremiscit</span>, the thought of this crucifies
them all their lives long, and makes them spend their days in fasting and
prayer, <span lang="la">ne mala haec contingant</span>, &amp;c. A Tartar prince, saith Marcus Polus,
<span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 23.</span> called Senex de Montibus, the better to establish his
government amongst his subjects, and to keep them in awe, found a
convenient place in a pleasant valley, environed with hills, in <a href="#note6402">[6402]</a><q>which
he made a delicious park full of odoriferous flowers and fruits, and a
palace of all worldly contents,</q> that could possibly be devised, music,
pictures, variety of meats, &amp;c., and chose out a certain young man, whom
with a <a href="#note6403">[6403]</a>soporiferous potion he so benumbed, that he perceived nothing:
<q>and so fast asleep as he was, caused him to be conveyed into this fair
garden:</q> where after he had lived awhile in all such pleasures a sensual
man could desire, <a href="#note6404">[6404]</a><q>He cast him into a sleep again, and brought him
forth, that when he awaked he might tell others he had been in Paradise.</q>
The like he did for hell, and by this means brought his people to
subjection. Because heaven and hell are mentioned in the scriptures, and to
be believed necessary by Christians: so cunningly can the devil and his
ministers, in imitation of true religion, counterfeit and forge the like,
to circumvent and delude his superstitious followers. Many such tricks and
impostures are acted by politicians, in China especially, but with what
effect I will discourse in the symptoms.

<p>Next to politicians, if I may distinguish them, are some of our priests
(who make religion policy), if not far beyond them, for they domineer over
princes and statesmen themselves. <span lang="la">Carnificinam exercent</span>, one saith they
tyrannise over men's consciences more than any other tormentors whatsoever,
partly for their commodity and gain; <span lang="la">Religionem enim omnium abusus</span> (as
<a href="#note6405">[6405]</a>Postellus holds), <span lang="la">quaestus scilicet sacrificum in causa est</span>: for
sovereignty, credit, to maintain their state and reputation, out of
ambition and avarice, which are their chief supporters: what have they not
made the common people believe? Impossibilities in nature, incredible
things; what devices, traditions, ceremonies, have they not invented in all
ages to keep men in obedience, to enrich themselves? <span lang="la">Quibus quaestui sunt
capti superstitione animi</span>, as <a href="#note6406">[6406]</a>Livy saith. Those Egyptian priests of
old got all the sovereignty into their hands, and knowing, as <a href="#note6407">[6407]</a>Curtius
insinuates, <span lang="la">nulla res efficacius multitudinem regit quam superstitio;
melius vatibus quam ducibus parent, vana religione capti, etiam impotentes
faeminae</span>; the common people will sooner obey priests than captains, and
nothing so forcible as superstition, or better than blind zeal to rule a
multitude; have so terrified and gulled them, that it is incredible to
relate. All nations almost have been besotted in this kind; amongst our
Britons and old Gauls the Druids; magi in Persia; philosophers in Greece;
Chaldeans amongst the Oriental; Brachmanni in India; Gymnosophists in
Ethiopia; the Turditanes in Spain; Augurs in Rome, have insulted; Apollo's
priests in Greece, Phaebades and Pythonissae, by their oracles and
phantasms; Amphiaraus and his companions; now Mahometan and pagan priests,
what can they not effect? How do they not infatuate the world? <span lang="la">Adeo
ubique</span> (as <a href="#note6408">[6408]</a>Scaliger writes of the Mahometan priests), <span lang="la">tum gentium
tum locorum, gens ista sacrorum ministra, vulgi secat spes, ad ea quae ipsi
fingunt somnia</span>, <q>so cunningly can they gull the commons in all places and
countries.</q> But above all others, that high priest of Rome, the dam of that
monstrous and superstitious brood, the bull-bellowing pope, which now
rageth in the West, that three-headed Cerberus hath played his part. <a href="#note6409">[6409]</a>
<q>Whose religion at this day is mere policy, a state wholly composed of
superstition and wit, and needs nothing but wit and superstition to
maintain it, that useth colleges and religious houses to as good purpose as
forts and castles, and doth more at this day</q> by a company of scribbling
parasites, fiery-spirited friars, zealous anchorites, hypocritical
confessors, and those praetorian soldiers, his Janissary Jesuits, and that
dissociable society, as <a href="#note6410">[6410]</a>Languis terms it, <span lang="la">postremus diaboli conatus et
saeculi excrementum</span>, that now stand in the fore front of the battle, will
have a monopoly of, and engross all other learning, but domineer in
divinity, <a href="#note6411">[6411]</a><span lang="la">Excipiunt soli totius vulnera belli</span>, and fight alone almost
(for the rest are but his dromedaries and asses), than ever he could have
done by garrisons and armies. What power of prince, or penal law, be it
never so strict, could enforce men to do that which for conscience' sake
they will voluntarily undergo? And as to fast from all flesh, abstain from
marriage, rise to their prayers at midnight, whip themselves, with
stupendous fasting and penance, abandon the world, wilful poverty, perform
canonical and blind obedience, to prostrate their goods, fortunes, bodies,
lives, and offer up themselves at their superior's feet, at his command?
What so powerful an engine as superstition? which they right well
perceiving, are of no religion at all themselves: <span lang="la">Primum enim</span> (as Calvin
rightly suspects, the tenor and practice of their life proves), <span lang="la">arcanae
illius theologiae, quod apud eos regnat, caput est, nullum esse deum</span>, they
hold there is no God, as Leo X. did, Hildebrand the magician, Alexander
VI., Julius II., mere atheists, and which the common proverb amongst them
approves, <a href="#note6412">[6412]</a><q>The worst Christians of Italy are the Romans, of the Romans
the priests are wildest, the lewdest priests are preferred to be cardinals,
and the baddest men amongst the cardinals is chosen to be pope,</q> that is an
epicure, as most part the popes are, infidels and Lucianists, for so they
think and believe; and what is said of Christ to be fables and impostures,
of heaven and hell, day of judgment, paradise, immortality of the soul, are
all,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6413">[6413]</a>Rumores vacui, verbaque inania,</div>
<div class="line">Et par sollicito fabula somnio.</div>
</div>
<q>Dreams, toys, and old wives' tales.</q> Yet as so many <a href="#note6414">[6414]</a>whetstones to make
other tools cut, but cut not themselves, though they be of no religion at
all, they will make others most devout and superstitious, by promises and
threats, compel, enforce from, and lead them by the nose like so many bears
in a line; when as their end is not to propagate the church, advance God's
kingdom, seek His glory or common good, but to enrich themselves, to
enlarge their territories, to domineer and compel them to stand in awe, to
live in subjection to the See of Rome. For what otherwise care they? <span lang="la">Si
mundus vult decipi, decipiatur</span>, <q>since the world wishes to be gulled, let
it be gulled,</q> 'tis fit it should be so. And for which <a href="#note6415">[6415]</a>Austin cites
Varro to maintain his Roman religion, we may better apply to them: <span lang="la">multa
vera, quae vulgus scire non est utile; pleraque falsa, quae tamen uliter
existimare populum expedit</span>; some things are true, some false, which for
their own ends they will not have the gullish commonalty take notice of. As
well may witness their intolerable covetousness, strange forgeries,
fopperies, fooleries, unrighteous subtleties, impostures, illusions, new
doctrines, paradoxes, traditions, false miracles, which they have still
forged, to enthral, circumvent and subjugate them, to maintain their own
estates. <a href="#note6416">[6416]</a>One while by bulls, pardons, indulgencies, and their doctrines
of good works, that they be meritorious, hope of heaven, by that means they
have so fleeced the commonalty, and spurred on this free superstitious
horse, that he runs himself blind, and is an ass to carry burdens. They
have so amplified Peter's patrimony, that from a poor bishop, he is become
<span lang="la">Rex Regum, Dominus dominantium</span>, a demigod, as his canonists make him
(Felinus and the rest), above God himself. And for his wealth and <a href="#note6417">[6417]</a>
temporalities, is not inferior to many kings: <a href="#note6418">[6418]</a>his cardinals, princes'
companions; and in every kingdom almost, abbots, priors, monks, friars,
&amp;c., and his clergy, have engrossed a <a href="#note6419">[6419]</a>third part, half, in some places
all, into their hands. Three princes, electors in Germany, bishops; besides
Magdeburg, Spire, Saltsburg, Breme, Bamberg, &amp;c. In France, as Bodine <span class="cite">lib.
de repub.</span> gives us to understand, their revenues are 12,300,000 livres;
and of twelve parts of the revenues in France, the church possesseth seven.
The Jesuits, a new sect, begun in this age, have, as <a href="#note6420">[6420]</a>Middendorpius and
<a href="#note6421">[6421]</a>Pelargus reckon up, three or four hundred colleges in Europe, and more
revenues than many princes. In France, as Arnoldus proves, in thirty years
they have got <span lang="la">bis centum librarum millia annua</span>, 200,000<i>l</i>. I say nothing
of the rest of their orders. We have had in England, as Armachanus
demonstrates, above 30,000 friars at once, and as <a href="#note6422">[6422]</a>Speed collects out of
Leland and others, almost 600 religious houses, and near 200,000<i>l.</i> in
revenues of the old rent belonging to them, besides images of gold, silver,
plate, furniture, goods and ornaments, as <a href="#note6423">[6423]</a>Weever calculates, and
esteems them at the dissolution of abbeys, worth a million of gold. How
many towns in every kingdom hath superstition enriched? What a deal of
money by musty relics, images, idolatry, have their mass-priests engrossed,
and what sums have they scraped by their other tricks! Loretto in Italy,
Walsingham in England, in those days. <span lang="la">Ubi omnia auro nitent</span>, <q>where
everything shines with gold,</q> saith Erasmus, St. Thomas's shrine, &amp;c., may
witness. <a href="#note6424">[6424]</a>Delphos so renowned of old in Greece for Apollo's oracle,
<span lang="la">Delos commune conciliabulum et emporium sola religions manitum</span>; Dodona,
whose fame and wealth were sustained by religion, were not so rich, so
famous. If they can get but a relic of some saint, the Virgin Mary's
picture, idols or the like, that city is for ever made, it needs no other
maintenance. Now if any of these their impostures or juggling tricks be
controverted, or called in question: if a magnanimous or zealous Luther, an
heroical Luther, as <a href="#note6425">[6425]</a>Dithmarus Calls him, dare touch the monks'
bellies, all is in a combustion, all is in an uproar: Demetrius and his
associates are ready to pull him in pieces, to keep up their trades, <a href="#note6426">[6426]</a>
<q>Great is Diana of the Ephesians:</q> with a mighty shout of two hours long
they will roar and not be pacified.

<p>Now for their authority, what by auricular confession, satisfaction,
penance, Peter's keys, thunderings, excommunications, &amp;c., roaring bulls,
this high priest of Rome, shaking his Gorgon's head, hath so terrified the
soul of many a silly man, insulted over majesty itself, and swaggered
generally over all Europe for many ages, and still doth to some, holding
them as yet in slavish subjection, as never tyrannising Spaniards did by
their poor Negroes, or Turks by their galley-slaves. <a href="#note6427">[6427]</a><q>The bishop of
Rome</q> (saith Stapleton, a parasite of his, <span class="cite">de mag. Eccles. lib. 2. cap.
1.</span>) <q>hath done that without arms, which those Roman emperors could never
achieve with forty legions of soldiers,</q> deposed kings, and crowned them
again with his foot, made friends, and corrected at his pleasure, &amp;c. <a href="#note6428">[6428]</a>
<q>'Tis a wonder,</q> saith Machiavel, <span class="cite">Florentinae, his. lib. 1.</span> <q>what slavery
King Henry II. endured for the death of Thomas a Beckett, what things he
was enjoined by the Pope, and how he submitted himself to do that which in
our times a private man would not endure,</q> and all through superstition.
<a href="#note6429">[6429]</a>Henry IV. disposed of his empire, stood barefooted with his wife at
the gates of Canossus. <a href="#note6430">[6430]</a>Frederic the Emperor was trodden on by
Alexander III., another held Adrian's stirrup, King John kissed the knees
of Pandulphos the Pope's legate, See. What made so many thousand Christians
travel from France, Britain, &amp;c., into the Holy Land, spend such huge sums
of money, go a pilgrimage so familiarly to Jerusalem, to creep and crouch,
but slavish superstition? What makes them so freely venture their lives, to
leave their native countries, to go seek martyrdom in the Indies, but
superstition? to be assassins, to meet death, murder kings, but a false
persuasion of merit, of canonical or blind obedience which they instil into
them, and animate them by strange illusions, hope of being martyrs and
saints: such pretty feats can the devil work by priests, and so well for
their own advantage can they play their parts. And if it were not yet
enough, by priests and politicians to delude mankind, and crucify the souls
of men, he hath more actors in his tragedy, more irons in the fire, another
scene of heretics, factious, ambitious wits, insolent spirits, schismatics,
impostors, false prophets, blind guides, that out of pride, singularity,
vainglory, blind zeal, cause much more madness yet, set all in an uproar
by their new doctrines, paradoxes, figments, crotchets, make new divisions,
subdivisions, new sects, oppose one superstition to another, one kingdom to
another, commit prince and subjects, brother against brother, father
against son, to the ruin and destruction of a commonwealth, to the
disturbance of peace, and to make a general confusion of all estates. How
did those Arians rage of old? how many did they circumvent? Those
Pelagians, Manichees, &amp;c., their names alone would make a just volume. How
many silly souls have impostors still deluded, drawn away, and quite
alienated from Christ! Lucian's Alexander Simon Magus, whose statue was to
be seen and adored in Rome, saith Justin Martyr, <span lang="la">Simoni deo sancto</span>, &amp;c.,
after his decease. <a href="#note6431">[6431]</a>Apollonius Tianaeus, Cynops, Eumo, who by
counterfeiting some new ceremonies and juggling tricks of that Dea Syria,
by spitting fire, and the like, got an army together of 40,000 men, and did
much harm: with <span lang="la">Eudo de stellis</span>, of whom Nubrigensis speaks, <span class="cite">lib. 1.
cap. 19.</span> that in King Stephen's days imitated most of Christ's miracles,
fed I know not how many people in the wilderness, and built castles in the
air, &amp;c., to the seducing of multitudes of poor souls. In Franconia, 1476,
a base illiterate fellow took upon him to be a prophet, and preach, John
Beheim by name, a neatherd at Nicholhausen, he seduced 30,000 persons, and
was taken by the commonalty to be a most holy man, come from heaven. <a href="#note6432">[6432]</a>
<q>Tradesmen left their shops, women their distaffs, servants ran from their
masters, children from their parents, scholars left their tutors, all to
hear him, some for novelty, some for zeal. He was burnt at last by the
Bishop of Wartzburg, and so he and his heresy vanished together.</q> How many
such impostors, false prophets, have lived in every king's reign? what
chronicles will not afford such examples? that as so many <span lang="la">ignes fatui</span>,
have led men out of the way, terrified some, deluded others, that are apt
to be carried about by the blast of every wind, a rude inconstant
multitude, a silly company of poor souls, that follow all, and are
cluttered together like so many pebbles in a tide. What prodigious follies,
madness, vexations, persecutions, absurdities, impossibilities, these
impostors, heretics, &amp;c., have thrust upon the world, what strange effects
shall be shown in the symptoms.

<p>Now the means by which, or advantages the devil and his infernal ministers
take, so to delude and disquiet the world with such idle ceremonies, false
doctrines, superstitious fopperies, are from themselves, innate fear,
ignorance, simplicity, hope and fear, those two battering cannons and
principal engines, with their objects, reward and punishment, purgatory,
<span lang="la">Limbus Patrum</span>, &amp;c. which now more than ever tyrannise; <a href="#note6433">[6433]</a><q>for what
province is free from atheism, superstition, idolatry, schism, heresy,
impiety, their factors and followers?</q> thence they proceed, and from that
same decayed image of God, which is yet remaining in us.

Our own conscience doth dictate so much unto us, we know there is a God and
nature doth inform us; <span lang="la">Nulla gens tam barbara</span> (saith Tully) <span lang="la">cui non
insideat haec persuasio Deum esse; sed nec Scytha, nec Groecus, nec Persa,
nec Hyperboreus dissentiet</span> (as Maximus Tyrius the Platonist <span class="cite">ser. 1.</span>
farther adds) <span lang="la">nec continentis nec insularum habitator</span>, let him dwell
where he will, in what coast soever, there is no nation so barbarous that
is not persuaded there is a God. It is a wonder to read of that infinite
superstition amongst the Indians in this kind, of their tenets in America,
<span lang="la">pro suo quisque libitu varias res venerabantur superstitiose, plantas,
animalia, montes, &amp;c. omne quod amabant aut horrebant</span> (some few places
excepted as he grants, that had no God at all). So <q>the heavens declare the
glory of God, and the firmament declares his handy work,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psalm xix.</span> <q>Every
creature will evince it;</q> <span lang="la">Praesentemque refert quaelibet herba deum.
Nolentes sciunt, fatentur inviti</span>, as the said Tyrius proceeds, will or
nill, they must acknowledge it. The philosophers, Socrates, Plato,
Plotinus, Pythagoras, Trismegistus, Seneca, Epictetus, those Magi, Druids,
&amp;c. went as far as they could by the light of nature; <a href="#note6435">[6435]</a><span lang="la">multa praeclara,
de natura Dei seripta reliquerunt</span>, <q>writ many things well of the nature of
God, but they had but a confused light, a glimpse,</q>

<q>as he that walks by moonshine in a wood,</q> they groped in the dark; they
had a gross knowledge, as he in Euripides, <span lang="la">O Deus quicquid es, sive
coelum, sive terra, sive aliud quid</span>, and that of Aristotle, <span lang="la">Ens entium
miserere mei.</span> And so of the immortality of the soul, and future happiness.
<span lang="la">Immortalitatem animae</span> (saith Hierom) <span lang="la">Pythagoras somniavit, Democritus non
credidit in consolalionem damnationis suae Socrates in carcere disputavit;
Indus, Persa, Cothus, &amp;c. Philosophantur.</span> So some said this, some that, as
they conceived themselves, which the devil perceiving, led them farther out
(as <a href="#note6437">[6437]</a>Lemnius observes) and made them worship him as their God with
stocks and stones, and torture themselves to their own destruction, as he
thought fit himself, inspired his priests and ministers with lies and
fictions to prosecute the same, which they for their own ends were as
willing to undergo, taking advantage of their simplicity, fear and
ignorance. For the common people are as a flock of sheep, a rude,
illiterate rout, void many times of common sense, a mere beast, <span lang="la">bellua
multorum capitum</span>, will go whithersoever they are led: as you lead a ram
over a gap by the horns, all the rest will follow, <a href="#note6438">[6438]</a><span lang="la">Non qua eundum,
sed qua itur</span>, they will do as they see others do, and as their prince will
have them, let him be of what religion he will, they are for him. Now for
those idolaters, Maxentius and Licinius, then for Constantine a Christian.
<a href="#note6439">[6439]</a><span lang="la">Qui Christum negant male pereant, acclamatum est Decies</span>, for two
hours' space; <span lang="la">qui Christum non colunt, Augusti inimici sunt, acclamatum
est ter decies</span>; and by and by idolaters again under that Apostate
Julianus; all Arians under Constantius, good Catholics again under
Jovinianus, <q>And little difference there is between the discretion of men
and children in this case, especially of old folks and women,</q> as <a href="#note6440">[6440]</a>
Cardan discourseth, <q>when, as they are tossed with fear and superstition,
and with other men's folly and dishonesty.</q> So that I may say their
ignorance is a cause of their superstition, a symptom, and madness itself:
<span lang="la">Supplicii causa est, sappliciumque sui.</span> Their own fear, folly, stupidity,
to be deplored lethargy, is that which gives occasion to the other, and
pulls these miseries on their own heads. For in all these religions and
superstitions, amongst our idolaters, you shall find that the parties first
affected, are silly, rude, ignorant people, old folks, that are naturally
prone to superstition, weak women, or some poor, rude, illiterate persons,
that are apt to be wrought upon, and gulled in this kind, prone without
either examination or due consideration (for they take up religion a trust,
as at mercers' they do their wares) to believe anything. And the best means
they have to broach first, or to maintain it when they have done, is to
keep them still in ignorance: for <q>ignorance is the mother of devotion,</q> as
all the world knows, and these times can amply witness. This hath been the
devil's practice, and his infernal ministers in all ages; not as our
Saviour by a few silly fishermen, to confound the wisdom of the world, to
save publicans and sinners, but to make advantage of their ignorance, to
convert them and their associates; and that they may better effect what
they intend, they begin, as I say, with poor, <a href="#note6441">[6441]</a>stupid, illiterate
persons. So Mahomet did when he published his Alcoran, which is a piece of
work (saith <a href="#note6442">[6442]</a>Bredenbachius) <q>full of nonsense, barbarism, confusion,
without rhyme, reason, or any good composition, first published to a
company of rude rustics, hog-rubbers, that had no discretion, judgment,
art, or understanding, and is so still maintained.</q> For it is a part of
their policy to let no man comment, dare to dispute or call in question to
this day any part of it, be it never so absurd, incredible, ridiculous,
fabulous as it is, must be believed <span lang="la">implicite</span>, upon pain of death no man
must dare to contradict it, <q>God and the emperor, &amp;c.</q> What else do our
papists, but by keeping the people in ignorance vent and broach all their
new ceremonies and traditions, when they conceal the scripture, read it in
Latin, and to some few alone, feeding the slavish people in the meantime
with tales out of legends, and such like fabulous narrations? Whom do they
begin with but collapsed ladies, some few tradesmen, superstitious old
folks, illiterate persons, weak women, discontent, rude, silly companions,
or sooner circumvent? So do all our schismatics and heretics. Marcus and
Valentinian heretics, in <a href="#note6443">[6443]</a>Irenaeus, seduced first I know not how many
women, and made them believe they were prophets. <a href="#note6444">[6444]</a>Friar Cornelius of
Dort seduced a company of silly women. What are all our Anabaptists,
Brownists, Barrowists, familists, but a company of rude, illiterate,
capricious, base fellows? What are most of our papists, but stupid,
ignorant and blind bayards? how should they otherwise be, when as they are
brought up and kept still in darkness? <a href="#note6445">[6445]</a><q>If their pastors</q> (saith
Lavater) <q>have done their duties, and instructed their flocks as they ought,
in the principles of Christian religion, or had not forbidden them the
reading of scriptures, they had not been as they are.</q> But being so misled
all their lives in superstition, and carried hoodwinked like hawks, how can
they prove otherwise than blind idiots, and superstitious asses? what else
shall we expect at their hands? Neither is it sufficient to keep them
blind, and in Cimmerian darkness, but withal, as a schoolmaster doth by his
boys, to make them follow their books, sometimes by good hope, promises and
encouragements, but most of all by fear, strict discipline, severity,
threats and punishment, do they collogue and soothe up their silly
auditors, and so bring them into a fools' paradise. <span lang="la">Rex eris aiunt, si
recte facies</span>, do well, thou shalt be crowned; but for the most part by
threats, terrors, and affrights, they tyrannise and terrify their
distressed souls: knowing that fear alone is the sole and only means to
keep men in obedience, according to that hemistichium of Petronius, <span lang="la">primus
in orbe deos fecit timor</span>, the fear of some divine and supreme powers,
keeps men in obedience, makes the people do their duties: they play upon
their consciences; <a href="#note6446">[6446]</a>which was practised of old in Egypt by their
priests; when there was an eclipse, they made the people believe God was
angry, great miseries were to come; they take all opportunities of natural
causes, to delude the people's senses, and with fearful tales out of
purgatory, feigned apparitions, earthquakes in Japonia or China, tragical
examples of devils, possessions, obsessions, false miracles, counterfeit
visions, &amp;c. They do so insult over and restrain them, never hoby so dared
a lark, that they will not <a href="#note6447">[6447]</a>offend the least tradition, tread, or
scarce look awry: <span lang="la">Deus bone</span> (<a href="#note6448">[6448]</a>Lavater exclaims) <span lang="la">quot hoc commentum
de purgatorio misere afflixit!</span> good God, how many men have been miserably
afflicted by this fiction of purgatory!

<p>To these advantages of hope and fear, ignorance and simplicity, he hath
several engines, traps, devices, to batter and enthral, omitting no
opportunities, according to men's several inclinations, abilities, to
circumvent and humour them, to maintain his superstitions, sometimes to
stupefy, besot them: sometimes again by oppositions, factions, to set all
at odds and in an uproar; sometimes he infects one man, and makes him a
principal agent; sometimes whole cities, countries. If of meaner sort, by
stupidity, canonical obedience, blind zeal, &amp;c. If of better note, by
pride, ambition, popularity, vainglory. If of the clergy and more eminent,
of better parts than the rest, more learned, eloquent, he puffs them up
with a vain conceit of their own worth, <span lang="la">scientia inflati</span>, they begin to
swell, and scorn all the world in respect of themselves, and thereupon turn
heretics, schismatics, broach new doctrines, frame new crotchets and the
like; or else out of too much learning become mad, or out of curiosity they
will search into God's secrets, and eat of the forbidden fruit; or out of
presumption of their holiness and good gifts, inspirations, become
prophets, enthusiasts, and what not? Or else if they be displeased,
discontent, and have not (as they suppose) preferment to their worth, have
some disgrace, repulse, neglected, or not esteemed as they fondly value
themselves, or out of emulation, they begin presently to rage and rave,
<span lang="la">coelum terrae, miscent</span>, they become so impatient in an instant, that a
whole kingdom cannot contain them, they will set all in a combustion, all
at variance, to be revenged of their adversaries. <a href="#note6449">[6449]</a>Donatus, when he saw
Cecilianus preferred before him in the bishopric of Carthage, turned
heretic, and so did Arian, because Alexander was advanced: we have examples
at home, and too many experiments of such persons. If they be laymen of
better note, the same engines of pride, ambition, emulation and jealousy,
take place, they will be gods themselves: <a href="#note6450">[6450]</a>Alexander in India, after
his victories, became so insolent, he would be adored for a god: and those
Roman emperors came to that height of madness, they must have temples built
to them, sacrifices to their deities, Divus Augustus, D. Claudius, D.
Adrianus: <a href="#note6451">[6451]</a>Heliogabalus, <q>put out that vestal fire at Rome, expelled
the virgins, and banished all other religions all over the world, and would
be the sole God himself.</q> Our Turks, China kings, great Chams, and Mogors
do little less, assuming divine and bombast titles to themselves; the
meaner sort are too credulous, and led with blind zeal, blind obedience, to
prosecute and maintain whatsoever their sottish leaders shall propose, what
they in pride and singularity, revenge, vainglory, ambition, spleen, for
gain, shall rashly maintain and broach, their disciples make a matter of
conscience, of hell and damnation, if they do it not, and will rather
forsake wives, children, house and home, lands, goods, fortunes, life
itself, than omit or abjure the least tittle of it, and to advance the
common cause, undergo any miseries, turn traitors, assassins,
pseudomartyrs, with full assurance and hope of reward in that other world,
that they shall certainly merit by it, win heaven, be canonised for saints.

<p>Now when they are truly possessed with blind zeal, and misled with
superstition, he hath many other baits to inveigle and infatuate them
farther yet, to make them quite mortified and mad, and that under colour of
perfection, to merit by penance, going woolward, whipping, alms, fastings,
&amp;c. An. 1320. there was a sect of <a href="#note6452">[6452]</a>whippers in Germany, that, to the
astonishment of the beholders, lashed, and cruelly tortured themselves. I
could give many other instances of each particular. But these works so done
are meritorious, <span lang="la">ex opere operato, ex condigno</span>, for themselves and
others, to make them macerate and consume their bodies, <span lang="la">specie virtutis et
umbra</span>, those evangelical counsels are propounded, as our pseudo-Catholics
call them, canonical obedience, wilful poverty, <a href="#note6453">[6453]</a>vows of chastity,
monkery, and a solitary life, which extend almost to all religions and
superstitions, to Turks, Chinese, Gentiles, Abyssinians, Greeks, Latins,
and all countries. Amongst the rest, fasting, contemplation, solitariness,
are as it were certain rams by which the devil doth batter and work upon
the strongest constitutions. <span lang="la">Nonnulli</span> (saith Peter Forestus) <span lang="la">ob longas
inedias, studia et meditationes coelestes, de rebus sacris et religione
semper agitant</span>, by fasting overmuch, and divine meditations, are overcome.
Not that fasting is a thing of itself to be discommended, for it is an
excellent means to keep the body in subjection, a preparative to devotion,
the physic of the soul, by which chaste thoughts are engendered, true zeal,
a divine spirit, whence wholesome counsels do proceed, concupiscence is
restrained, vicious and predominant lusts and humours are expelled. The
fathers are very much in commendation of it, and, as Calvin notes,
<q>sometimes immoderate. <a href="#note6454">[6454]</a>The mother of health, key of heaven, a
spiritual wing to arear us, the chariot of the Holy Ghost, banner of
faith,</q> &amp;c. And 'tis true they say of it, if it be moderately and
seasonably used, by such parties as Moses, Elias, Daniel, Christ, and his
<a href="#note6455">[6455]</a>apostles made use of it; but when by this means they will
supererogate, and as <a href="#note6456">[6456]</a>Erasmus well taxeth, <span lang="la">Coelum non sufficere putant
suis meritis.</span> Heaven is too small a reward for it; they make choice of
times and meats, buy and sell their merits, attribute more to them than to
the ten Commandments, and count it a greater sin to eat meat in Lent, than
to kill a man, and as one sayeth, <span lang="la">Plus respiciunt assum piscem, quam
Christum crucifixum, plus salmonem quam Solomonem, quibus in ore Christus,
Epicurus in corde</span>, <q>pay more respect to a broiled fish than to Christ
crucified, more regard to salmon than to Solomon, have Christ on their
lips, but Epicurus in their hearts,</q> when some counterfeit, and some
attribute more to such works of theirs than to Christ's death and passion;
the devil sets in a foot, strangely deludes them, and by that means makes
them to overthrow the temperature of their bodies, and hazard their souls.
Never any strange illusions of devils amongst hermits, anchorites, never
any visions, phantasms, apparitions, enthusiasms, prophets, any
revelations, but immoderate fasting, bad diet, sickness, melancholy,
solitariness, or some such things, were the precedent causes, the
forerunners or concomitants of them. The best opportunity and sole occasion
the devil takes to delude them. Marcilius Cognatus, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cont. cap.
7.</span> hath many stories to this purpose, of such as after long fasting have
been seduced by devils; and <a href="#note6457">[6457]</a><q>'tis a miraculous thing to relate</q> (as
Cardan writes) <q>what strange accidents proceed from fasting; dreams,
superstition, contempt of torments, desire of death, prophecies, paradoxes,
madness; fasting naturally prepares men to these things.</q> Monks,
anchorites, and the like, after much emptiness, become melancholy,
vertiginous, they think they hear strange noises, confer with hobgoblins,
devils, rivel up their bodies, <span lang="la">et dum hostem insequimur</span>, saith Gregory,
<span lang="la">civem quem diligimus, trucidamus</span>, they become bare skeletons, skin and
bones; <span lang="la">Carnibus abstinentes proprias carnes devorant, ut nil praeter cutem
et ossa sit reliquum.</span> Hilarion, as <a href="#note6458">[6458]</a>Hierome reports in his life, and
Athanasius of Antonius, was so bare with fasting, <q>that the skin did scarce
stick to the bones; for want of vapours he could not sleep, and for want of
sleep became idleheaded, heard every night infants cry, oxen low, wolves
howl, lions roar</q> (as he thought), <q>clattering of chains, strange voices, and
the like illusions of devils.</q> Such symptoms are common to those that fast
long, are solitary, given to contemplation, overmuch solitariness and
meditation. Not that these things (as I said of fasting) are to be
discommended of themselves, but very behoveful in some cases and good:
sobriety and contemplation join our souls to God, as that heathen
<a href="#note6459">[6459]</a>Porphyry can tell us. <a href="#note6460">[6460]</a><q>Ecstasy is a taste of future happiness, by
which we are united unto God, a divine melancholy, a spiritual wing,</q>
Bonaventure terms it, to lift us up to heaven; but as it is abused, a mere
dotage, madness, a cause and symptom of religious melancholy. <a href="#note6461">[6461]</a><q>If you
shall at any time see</q> (saith Guianerius) <q>a religious person
over-superstitious, too solitary, or much given to fasting, that man will
certainly be melancholy, thou mayst boldly say it, he will be so.</q> P.
Forestus hath almost the same words, and <a href="#note6462">[6462]</a>Cardan <span class="cite">subtil, lib. 18. et
cap. 40. lib. 8. de rerum varietate</span>, <q>solitariness, fasting, and that
melancholy humour, are the causes of all hermits' illusions.</q> Lavater, <span class="cite">de
spect. cap. 19. part. 1.</span> and <span class="cite">part. 1. cap. 10.</span> puts solitariness a
main cause of such spectrums and apparitions; none, saith he, so melancholy
as monks and hermits, the devil's hath melancholy; <a href="#note6463">[6463]</a><q>none so subject to
visions and dotage in this kind, as such as live solitary lives, they hear
and act strange things in their dotage.</q> <a href="#note6464">[6464]</a>Polydore Virgil, <span class="cite">lib. 2.
prodigiis</span>, <q>holds that those prophecies and monks' revelations? nuns,
dreams, which they suppose come from God, to proceed wholly <span lang="la">ab instinctu
daemonum</span>, by the devil's means;</q> and so those enthusiasts, Anabaptists,
pseudoprophets from the same cause. <a href="#note6465">[6465]</a>Fracastorius, <span class="cite">lib. 2. de
intellect</span>, will have all your pythonesses, sibyls, and pseudoprophets to
be mere melancholy, so doth Wierus prove, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 8. et l. 3.
cap. 7.</span> and Arculanus in 9 Rhasis, that melancholy is a sole cause, and
the devil together, with fasting and solitariness, of such sibylline
prophecies, if there were ever such, which with <a href="#note6466">[6466]</a>Casaubon and others I
justly except at; for it is not likely that the Spirit of God should ever
reveal such manifest revelations and predictions of Christ, to those
Pythonissae witches, Apollo's priests, the devil's ministers, (they were no
better) and conceal them from his own prophets; for these sibyls set down
all particular circumstances of Christ's coming, and many other future
accidents far more perspicuous and plain than ever any prophet did. But,
howsoever, there be no Phaebades or sibyls, I am assured there be other
enthusiasts, prophets, <span lang="la">dii Fatidici</span>, Magi, (of which read Jo. Boissardus,
who hath laboriously collected them into a great <a href="#note6467">[6467]</a>volume of late, with
elegant pictures, and epitomised their lives) &amp;c., ever have been in all
ages, and still proceeding from those causes, <a href="#note6468">[6468]</a><span lang="la">qui visiones suas
enarrant, somniant futura, prophetisant, et ejusmodi deliriis agitati,
Spiritum Sanctum sibi communicari putant</span>. That which is written of Saint
Francis' five wounds, and other such monastical effects, of him and others,
may justly be referred to this our melancholy; and that which Matthew Paris
relates of the <a href="#note6469">[6469]</a>monk of Evesham, who saw heaven and hell in a vision; of
<a href="#note6470">[6470]</a>Sir Owen, that went down into Saint Patrick's purgatory in King
Stephen's days, and saw as much; Walsingham of him that showed as much by
Saint Julian. Beda, <span class="cite">lib. 5. cap. 13. 14. 15. et 20.</span> reports of King
Sebba, <span class="cite">lib. 4. cap. 11. eccles. hist.</span> that saw strange <a href="#note6471">[6471]</a>visions;
and Stumphius Helvet Cornic, a cobbler of Basle, that beheld rare
apparitions at Augsburg, <a href="#note6472">[6472]</a>in Germany. Alexander ab Alexandro, <span class="cite">gen.
dier. lib. 6. cap. 21.</span> of an enthusiastical prisoner, (all out as
probable as that of Eris Armenius, in Plato's tenth dialogue <span class="cite">de Repub.</span>
that revived again ten days after he was killed in a battle, and told
strange wonders, like those tales Ulysses related to Alcinous in Homer, or
Lucian's <span lang="la">vera historia</span> itself) was still after much solitariness,
fasting, or long sickness, when their brains were addled, and their bellies
as empty of meat as their heads of wit. Florilegus hath many such examples,
<span class="cite">fol. 191.</span> one of Saint Gultlake of Crowald that fought with devils, but
still after long fasting, overmuch solitariness, <a href="#note6473">[6473]</a>the devil persuaded
him therefore to fast, as Moses and Elias did, the better to delude him.
<a href="#note6474">[6474]</a>In the same author is recorded Carolus Magnus vision <i>an.</i> 185. or
ecstasies, wherein he saw heaven and hell after much fasting and
meditation. So did the devil of old with Apollo's priests. Amphiaraus and
his fellows, those Egyptians, still enjoin long fasting before he would
give any oracles, <span lang="la">triduum a cibo et vino abstinerent</span>, <a href="#note6475">[6475]</a>before they
gave any answers, as Volateran <span class="cite">lib. 13. cap. 4.</span> records, and Strabo
<span class="cite">Geog. lib. 14.</span> describes Charon's den, in the way between Tralles and
Nissum, whither the priests led sick and fanatic men: but nothing performed
without long fasting, no good to be done. That scoffing <a href="#note6476">[6476]</a>Lucian conducts
his Menippus to hell by the directions of that Chaldean Mithrobarzanes, but
after long fasting, and such like idle preparation. Which the Jesuits right
well perceiving of what force this fasting and solitary meditation is, to
alter men's minds, when they would make a man mad, ravish him, improve him
beyond himself, to undertake some great business of moment, to kill a king,
or the like, <a href="#note6477">[6477]</a>they bring him into a melancholy dark chamber, where he
shall see no light for many days together, no company, little meat, ghastly
pictures of devils all about him, and leave him to lie as he will himself,
on the bare floor in this chamber of meditation, as they call it, on his
back, side, belly, till by this strange usage they make him quite mad and
beside himself. And then after some ten days, as they find him animated and
resolved, they make use of him. The devil hath many such factors, many such
engines, which what effect they produce, you shall hear in the following
symptoms.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.4.1.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Symptoms general, love to their own sect, hate of all other religions, obstinacy, peevishness, ready to undergo any danger or cross for it; Martyrs, blind zeal, blind obedience, fastings, vows, belief of incredibilities, impossibilities: Particular of Gentiles, Mahometans, Jews, Christians; and in them, heretics old, and new, schismatics, schoolmen, prophets, enthusiasts, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p><span lang="la">Fleat Heraclitus, an rideat Democritus</span>? in attempting to speak of these
symptoms, shall I laugh with Democritus, or weep with Heraclitus? they are
so ridiculous and absurd on the one side, so lamentable and tragical on the
other: a mixed scene offers itself, so full of errors and a promiscuous
variety of objects, that I know not in what strain to represent it. When I
think of the Turkish paradise, those Jewish fables, and pontifical rites,
those pagan superstitions, their sacrifices, and ceremonies, as to make
images of all matter, and adore them when they have done, to see them, kiss
the pyx, creep to the cross, &amp;c. I cannot choose but laugh with Democritus:
but when I see them whip and torture themselves, grind their souls for toys
and trifles, desperate, and now ready to die, I cannot but weep with
Heraclitus. When I see a priest say mass, with all those apish gestures,
murmurings, &amp;c. read the customs of the Jews' synagogue, or Mahometa
Meschites, I must needs <a href="#note6478">[6478]</a>laugh at their folly, <span lang="la">risum teneatis amici</span>?
but when I see them make matters of conscience of such toys and trifles, to
adore the devil, to endanger their souls, to offer their children to their
idols, &amp;c. I must needs condole their misery. When I see two superstitious
orders contend <span lang="la">pro aris et focis</span>, with such have and hold, <span lang="la">de lana,
caprina</span>, some write such great volumes to no purpose, take so much pains
to so small effect, their satires, invectives, apologies, dull and gross
fictions; when I see grave learned men rail and scold like butter-women,
methinks 'tis pretty sport, and fit <a href="#note6479">[6479]</a>for Calphurnius and Democritus to
laugh at. But when I see so much blood spilt, so many murders and
massacres, so many cruel battles fought, &amp;c. 'tis a fitter subject for
Heraclitus to lament. <a href="#note6480">[6480]</a>As Merlin when he sat by the lake side with
Vortigern, and had seen the white and red dragon fight, before he began to
interpret or to speak, <span lang="la">in fletum prorupit</span>, fell a weeping, and then
proceeded to declare to the king what it meant. I should first pity and
bewail this misery of human kind with some passionate preface, wishing mine
eyes a fountain of tears, as Jeremiah did, and then to my task. For it is
that great torture, that infernal plague of mortal men, <span lang="la">omnium pestium
pestilentissima superstitio</span>, and able of itself alone to stand in
opposition to all other plagues, miseries and calamities whatsoever; far
more cruel, more pestiferous, more grievous, more general, more violent, of
a greater extent. Other fears and sorrows, grievances of body and mind, are
troublesome for the time; but this is for ever, eternal damnation, hell
itself, a plague, a fire: an inundation hurts one province alone, and the
loss may be recovered; but this superstition involves all the world almost,
and can never be remedied. Sickness and sorrows come and go, but a
superstitious soul hath no rest; <a href="#note6481">[6481]</a><span lang="la">superstitione imbutus animus nunquam
quietus esse potest</span>, no peace, no quietness. True religion and
superstition are quite opposite, <span lang="la">longe diversa carnificina et pietas</span>, as
Lactantius describes, the one erects, the other dejects; <span lang="la">illorum pietas,
mera impietus</span>; the one is an easy yoke, the other an intolerable burden,
an absolute tyranny; the one a sure anchor, a haven; the other a
tempestuous ocean; the one makes, the other mars; the one is wisdom, the
other is folly, madness, indiscretion; the one unfeigned, the other a
counterfeit; the one a diligent observer, the other an ape; one leads
to heaven, the other to hell. But these differences will more evidently
appear by their particular symptoms. What religion is, and of what parts it
doth consist, every catechism will tell you, what symptoms it hath, and
what effects it produceth: but for their superstitions, no tongue can tell
them, no pen express, they are so many, so diverse, so uncertain, so
inconstant, and so different from themselves. <span lang="la">Tot mundi superstitiones
quot coelo stellae</span>, one saith, there be as many superstitions in the world,
as there be stars in heaven, or devils themselves that are the first
founders of them: with such ridiculous, absurd symptoms and signs, so many
several rites, ceremonies, torments and vexations accompanying, as may well
express and beseem the devil to be the author and maintainer of them. I
will only point at some of them, <span lang="la">ex ungue leonem</span> guess at the rest, and
those of the chief kinds of superstition, which beside us Christians now
domineer and crucify the world, Gentiles, Mahometans, Jews, &amp;c.

<p>Of these symptoms some be general, some particular to each private sect:
general to all, are, an extraordinary love and affection they bear and show
to such as are of their own sect, and more than Vatinian hate to such as
are opposite in religion, as they call it, or disagree from them in their
superstitious rites, blind zeal, (which is as much a symptom as a cause,)
vain fears, blind obedience, needless works, incredibilities,
impossibilities, monstrous rites and ceremonies, wilfulness, blindness,
obstinacy, &amp;c. For the first, which is love and hate, as <a href="#note6482">[6482]</a>Montanus
saith, <span lang="la">nulla firmior amicitia quam quae contrahitur hinc; nulla discordia
major, quam quae a religione fit</span>; no greater concord, no greater discord
than that which proceeds from religion, it is incredible to relate, did not
our daily experience evince it, what factions, <span lang="la">quam teterrimae factiones</span>,
(as <a href="#note6483">[6483]</a>Rich. Dinoth writes) have been of late for matters of religion in
France, and what hurlyburlies all over Europe for these many years. <span lang="la">Nihil
est quod tam impotentur rapiat homines, quam suscepta de salute opinio;
siquidem pro ea omnes gentes corpora et animas devovere solent, et
arctissimo necessitudinis vinculo se invicem colligare.</span> We are all
brethren in Christ, servants of one Lord, members of one body, and
therefore are or should be at least dearly beloved, inseparably allied in
the greatest bond of love and familiarity, united partakers not only of the
same cross, but coadjutors, comforters, helpers, at all times, upon all
occasions: as they did in the primitive church, <span class="bibcite">Acts the 5.</span> they sold
their patrimonies, and laid them at the apostles' feet, and many such
memorable examples of mutual love we have had under the ten general
persecutions, many since. Examples on the other side of discord none like,
as our Saviour saith, he came therefore into the world to set father
against son, &amp;c. In imitation of whom the devil belike (<a href="#note6484">[6484]</a><span lang="la">nam
superstitio irrepsit verae religionis imitatrix</span>, superstition is still
religion's ape, as in all other things, so in this) doth so combine and
glue together his superstitious followers in love and affection, that they
will live and die together: and what an innate hatred hath he still
inspired to any other superstition opposite? How those old Romans were
affected, those ten persecutions may be a witness, and that cruel
executioner in Eusebius, <span lang="la">aut lita aut morere</span>, sacrifice or die. No
greater hate, more continuate, bitter faction, wars, persecution in all
ages, than for matters of religion, no such feral opposition, father
against son, mother against daughter, husband against wife, city against
city, kingdom against kingdom: as of old at Tentira and Combos:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6485">[6485]</a>Immortale odium, et nunquam sanabile vulnus,</div>

The Turks at this day count no better of us than of dogs, so they commonly
call us giaours, infidels, miscreants, make that their main quarrel and
cause of Christian persecution. If he will turn Turk, he shall be
entertained as a brother, and had in good esteem, a Mussulman or a
believer, which is a greater tie to them than any affinity or
consanguinity. The Jews stick together like so many burrs; but as for the
rest, whom they call Gentiles, they do hate and abhor, they cannot endure
their Messiah should be a common saviour to us all, and rather, as
<a href="#note6486">[6486]</a>Luther writes, <q>than they that now scoff at them, curse them, persecute
and revile them, shall be coheirs and brethren with them, or have any part
or fellowship with their Messiah, they would crucify their Messiah ten
times over, and God himself, his angels, and all his creatures, if it were
possible, though they endure a thousand hells for it.</q> Such is their malice
towards us. Now for Papists, what in a common cause, for the advancement of
their religion they will endure, our traitors and pseudo-Catholics will
declare unto us; and how bitter on the other side to their adversaries, how
violently bent, let those Marian times record, as those miserable
slaughters at Merindol and Cabriers, the Spanish inquisition, the Duke of
Alva's tyranny in the Low Countries, the French massacres and civil wars.
<a href="#note6487">[6487]</a><span lang="la">Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum</span>. <q>Such wickedness did
religion persuade.</q> Not there only, but all over Europe, we read of bloody
battles, racks and wheels, seditions, factions, oppositions.

Invectives and contentions. They had rather shake hands with a Jew, Turk,
or, as the Spaniards do, suffer Moors to live amongst them, and Jews, than
Protestants; <q>my name</q> (saith <a href="#note6489">[6489]</a>Luther) <q>is more odious to them than any
thief or murderer.</q> So it is with all heretics and schismatics whatsoever:
and none so passionate, violent in their tenets, opinions, obstinate,
wilful, refractory, peevish, factious, singular and stiff in defence of
them; they do not only persecute and hate, but pity all other religions,
account them damned, blind, as if they alone were the true church, they are
the true heirs, have the fee-simple of heaven by a peculiar donation, 'tis
entailed on them and their posterities, their doctrine sound, <span lang="la">per funem
aureum de coelo delapsa doctrinci</span>, <q>let down from, heaven by a golden
rope,</q> they alone are to be saved, The Jews at this day are so
incomprehensibly proud and churlish, saith <a href="#note6490">[6490]</a>Luther, that <span lang="la">soli salvari,
soli domini terrarum salutari volunt.</span> And as <a href="#note6491">[6491]</a>Buxtorfius adds, <q>so
ignorant and self-willed withal, that amongst their most understanding
Rabbins you shall find nought but gross dotage, horrible hardness of heart,
and stupendous obstinacy, in all their actions, opinions, conversations:
and yet so zealous with all, that no man living can be more, and vindicate
themselves for the elect people of GOD.</q> 'Tis so with all other
superstitious sects, Mahometans, Gentiles in China, and Tartary: our
ignorant Papists, Anabaptists, Separatists, and peculiar churches of
Amsterdam, they alone, and none but they can be saved. <a href="#note6492">[6492]</a><q>Zealous</q> (as
Paul saith, <span class="bibcite">Rom. x. 2.</span>) <q>without knowledge,</q> they will endure any misery,
any trouble, suffer and do that which the sunbeams will not endure to see,
<span lang="la">Religionis acti Furiis</span>, all extremities, losses and dangers, take any
pains, fast, pray, vow chastity, wilful poverty, forsake all and follow
their idols, die a thousand deaths as some Jews did to Pilate's soldiers,
in like case, <span lang="la">exertos praebentes jugulos, et manifeste prae se ferentes</span>,
(as Josephus hath it) <span lang="la">cariorem esse rita sibi legis patriae observationem</span>,
rather than abjure, or deny the least particle of that religion which their
fathers profess, and they themselves have been brought up in, be it never
so absurd, ridiculous, they will embrace it, and without farther inquiry or
examination of the truth, though it be prodigiously false, they will
believe it; they will take much more pains to go to hell, than we shall do
to heaven. Single out the most ignorant of them, convince his
understanding, show him his errors, grossness, and absurdities of his sect.
<span lang="la">Non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris</span>, he will not be persuaded. As those
pagans told the Jesuits in Japona, <a href="#note6493">[6493]</a>they would do as their forefathers
have done: and with Ratholde the Frisian Prince, go to hell for company, if
most of their friends went thither: they will not be moved, no persuasion,
no torture can stir them. So that papists cannot brag of their vows,
poverty, obedience, orders, merits, martyrdoms, fastings, alms, good works,
pilgrimages: much and more than all this, I shall show you, is, and hath
been done by these superstitious Gentiles, Pagans, Idolaters and Jews:
their blind zeal and idolatrous superstition in all kinds is much at one;
little or no difference, and it is hard to say which is the greatest, which
is the grossest. For if a man shall duly consider those superstitious rites
amongst the Ethnics in Japan, the Bannians in Gusart, the Chinese
idolaters, <a href="#note6494">[6494]</a>Americans of old, in Mexico especially, Mahometan priests,
he shall find the same government almost, the same orders and ceremonies,
or so like, that they may seem all apparently to be derived from some
heathen spirit, and the Roman hierarchy no better than the rest. In a word,
this is common to all superstition, there is nothing so mad and absurd, so
ridiculous, impossible, incredible, which they will not believe, observe,
and diligently perform, as much as in them lies; nothing so monstrous to
conceive, or intolerable to put in practice, so cruel to suffer, which they
will not willingly undertake. So powerful a thing is superstition. <a href="#note6495">[6495]</a><q>O
Egypt</q> (as Trismegistus exclaims) <q>thy religion is fables, and such as
posterity will not believe.</q> I know that in true religion itself, many
mysteries are so apprehended alone by faith, as that of the Trinity, which
Turks especially deride, Christ's incarnation, resurrection of the body at
the last day, <span lang="la">quod ideo credendum</span> (saith Tertullian) <span lang="la">quod incredible</span>,
&amp;c. many miracles not to be controverted or disputed of. <span lang="la">Mirari non
rimari sapientia vera est</span>, saith <a href="#note6496">[6496]</a>Gerhardus; <span lang="la">et in divinis</span> (as a good
father informs us) <span lang="la">quaedam credenda, quaedam admiranda</span>, &amp;c. some things are
to be believed, embraced, followed with all submission and obedience, some
again admired. Though Julian the apostate scoff at Christians in this
point, <span lang="la">quod captivemus intellectum in obsequium fidei</span>, saying, that the
Christian creed is like the Pythagorean <span lang="la">Ipse dixit</span>, we make our will and
understanding too slavishly subject to our faith, without farther
examination of the truth; yet as Saint Gregory truly answers, our creed is
<span lang="la">altioris praestantiae</span>, and much more divine; and as Thomas will, <span lang="la">pie
consideranti semper suppetunt rationes, ostendentes credibilitatem in
mysteriis supernaturalibus</span>, we do absolutely believe it, and upon good
reasons, for as Gregory well informeth us; <span lang="la">Fides non habet meritum, ubi
humana ratio quaerit experimentum</span>; that faith hath no merit, is not worth
the name of faith, that will not apprehend without a certain demonstration:
we must and will believe God's word; and if we be mistaken or err in our
general belief, as <a href="#note6497">[6497]</a>Richardus de <span lang="la">Sancto Victore</span>, vows he will say to
Christ himself at the day of judgment; <q>Lord, if we be deceived, thou alone
hast deceived us:</q> thus we plead. But for the rest I will not justify that
pontificial consubstantiation, that which <a href="#note6498">[6498]</a>Mahometans and Jews justly
except at, as Campanella confesseth, <span class="cite">Atheismi triumphat. cap. 12. fol.
125</span>, <span lang="la">difficillimum dogma esse, nec aliud subjectum magis haereticorum
blasphemiis, et stultis irrisionibus politicorum reperiri</span>. They hold it
impossible, <span lang="la">Deum in pane manducari</span>; and besides they scoff at it, <span lang="la">vide
gentem comedentem Deum suum, inquit quidam Maurus</span>. <a href="#note6499">[6499]</a><span lang="la">Hunc Deum muscae et

particulis, idem corpus numero, tam multis locis, caelo, terra</span>, &amp;c. But he
that shall read the <a href="#note6500">[6500]</a>Turks' Alcoran, the Jews' Talmud, and papists'
golden legend, in the mean time will swear that such gross fictions,
fables, vain traditions, prodigious paradoxes and ceremonies, could never
proceed from any other spirit, than that of the devil himself, which is the
author of confusion and lies; and wonder withal how such wise men as have
been of the Jews, such learned understanding men as Averroes, Avicenna, or
those heathen philosophers, could ever be persuaded to believe, or to
subscribe to the least part of them: <span lang="la">aut fraudem non detegere</span>: but that
as <a href="#note6501">[6501]</a>Vanninus answers, <span lang="la">ob publicae, potestatis formidinem allatrare
philosophi non audebant</span>, they durst not speak for fear of the law. But I
will descend to particulars: read their several symptoms and then guess.

<p>Of such symptoms as properly belong to superstition, or that irreligious
religion, I may say as of the rest, some are ridiculous, some again feral
to relate. Of those ridiculous, there can be no better testimony than the
multitude of their gods, those absurd names, actions, offices they put upon
them, their feasts, holy days, sacrifices, adorations, and the like. The
Egyptians that pretended so great antiquity, 300 kings before Amasis: and
as Mela writes, 13,000 years from the beginning of their chronicles, that
bragged so much of their knowledge of old, for they invented arithmetic,
astronomy, geometry: of their wealth and power, that vaunted of 20,000
cities: yet at the same time their idolatry and superstition was most
gross: they worshipped, as Diodorus Siculus records, sun and moon under the
name of Isis and Osiris, and after, such men as were beneficial to them, or
any creature that did them good. In the city of Bubasti they adored a cat,
saith Herodotus. Ibis and storks, an ox: (saith Pliny) <a href="#note6502">[6502]</a>leeks and
onions, Macrobius,
<div class="poem" lang="la">

</div>
Scoffing <a href="#note6504">[6504]</a>Lucian in his <span class="cite">vera Historia</span>: which, as he confesseth
himself, was not persuasively written as a truth, but in comical fashion to
glance at the monstrous fictions and gross absurdities of writers and
nations, to deride without doubt this prodigious Egyptian idolatry, feigns
this story of himself: that when he had seen the Elysian fields, and was
now coming away, Rhadamanthus gave him a mallow root, and bade him pray to
that when he was in any peril or extremity; which he did accordingly; for
when he came to Hydamordia in the island of treacherous women, he made his
prayers to his root, and was instantly delivered. The Syrians, Chaldeans,
had as many proper gods of their own invention; see the said Lucian <span class="cite">de dea

Rosinus of the Romans, and Lilius Giraldus of the Greeks. The Romans
borrowed from all, besides their own gods, which were <span lang="la">majorum</span> and
<span lang="la">minorum gentium</span>, as Varro holds, certain and uncertain; some celestial,
select, and great ones, others indigenous and Semi-dei, Lares, Lemures,
Dioscuri, Soteres, and Parastatae, <span lang="la">dii tutelares</span> amongst the Greeks: gods
of all sorts, for all functions; some for the land, some for sea; some for
heaven, some for hell; some for passions, diseases, some for birth, some
for weddings, husbandry, woods, waters, gardens, orchards, &amp;c. All actions

Invidia, Protervia, Risus, Angerona, Volupia, Vacuna, Viriplaca, Veneranda,
Pales, Neptunia, Doris, kings, emperors, valiant men that had done any good
offices for them, they did likewise canonise and adore for gods, and it was
usually done, <span lang="la">usitatum apud antiquos</span>, as <a href="#note6507">[6507]</a>Jac. Boissardus well
observes, <span lang="la">deificare homines qui beneficiis mortales juvarent</span>, and the
devil was still ready to second their intents, <span lang="la">statim se ingessit illorum
sepulchris, statuis, templis, aris</span>, &amp;c. he crept into their temples,
statues, tombs, altars, and was ready to give oracles, cure diseases, do
miracles, &amp;c. as by Jupiter, Aesculapius, Tiresias, Apollo, Mopsus,
Amphiaraus, &amp;c. <span lang="la">dii et Semi-dii.</span> For so they were <span lang="la">Semi-dii</span>, demigods,
some <span lang="la">medii inter Deos et homines</span>, as Max. <a href="#note6508">[6508]</a>Tyrius, the Platonist,
<span class="cite">ser. 26. et 27</span>, maintains and justifies in many words. <q>When a good man
dies, his body is buried, but his soul, <span lang="la">ex homine daemon evadit</span>, becomes
forthwith a demigod, nothing disparaged with malignity of air, or variety
of forms, rejoiceth, exults and sees that perfect beauty with his eyes. Now
being deified, in commiseration he helps his poor friends here on earth,
his kindred and allies, informs, succours, &amp;c. punisheth those that are bad
and do amiss, as a good genius to protect and govern mortal men appointed
by the gods, so they will have it, ordaining some for provinces, some for
private men, some for one office, some for another. Hector and Achilles
assist soldiers to this day; Aesculapius all sick men, the Dioscuri
seafaring men, &amp;c. and sometimes upon occasion they show themselves. The
Dioscuri, Hercules and Aesculapius, he saw himself (or the devil in his
likeness) <span lang="la">non somnians sed vigilans ipse vidi</span>:</q> So far Tyrius. And not
good men only do they thus adore, but tyrants, monsters, devils, (as <a href="#note6509">[6509]</a>
Stuckius inveighs) Neros, Domitians, Heliogables, beastly women, and arrant
whores amongst the rest. <q>For all intents, places, creatures, they assign
gods;</q>
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Et domibus, tectis, thermis, et equis soleatis</div>
<div class="line">Assignare solent genios&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
saith Prudentius. Cuna for cradles, Diverra for sweeping houses, Nodina
knots, Prema, Pramunda, Hymen, Hymeneus, for weddings; Comus the god of
good fellows, gods of silence, of comfort, Hebe goddess of youth, <span lang="la">Mena
menstruarum</span>, &amp;c. male and female gods, of all ages, sexes and dimensions,
with beards, without beards, married, unmarried, begot, not born at all,
but, as Minerva, start out of Jupiter's head. Hesiod reckons up at least
30,000 gods, Varro 300 Jupiters. As Jeremy told them, their gods were to
the multitude of cities;
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line">Quicquid humus, pelagus, coelum miserabile gignit</div>
<div class="line">Id dixere deos, colles, freta, flumina, flammas.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Whatever heavens, sea, and land begat,</div>
<div class="line">Hills, seas, and rivers, God was this and that.</div>
</div>
And which was most absurd, they made gods upon such ridiculous occasions;
<q>As children make babies</q> (so saith <a href="#note6510">[6510]</a>Morneus), <q>their poets make gods,</q>
<span lang="la">et quos adorant in templis, ludunt in Theatris</span>, as Lactantius scoffs.
Saturn, a man, gelded himself, did eat his own children, a cruel tyrant
driven out of his kingdom by his son Jupiter, as good a god as himself, a
wicked lascivious paltry king of Crete, of whose rapes, lusts, murders,
villainies, a whole volume is too little to relate. Venus, a notorious
strumpet, as common as a barber's chair, Mars, Adonis, Anchises' whore, is
a great she-goddess, as well as the rest, as much renowned by their poets,
with many such; and these gods so fabulously and foolishly made,
<span lang="la">ceremoniis, hymnis, et canticis celebrunt</span>; their errors, <span lang="la">luctus et
gaudia, amores, iras, nuptias et liberorum procreationes</span> (<a href="#note6511">[6511]</a>as Eusebius
well taxeth), weddings, mirth and mournings, loves, angers, and quarrelling
they did celebrate in hymns, and sing of in their ordinary songs, as it
were publishing their villainies. But see more of their originals. When
Romulus was made away by the sedition of the senators, to pacify the
people, <a href="#note6512">[6512]</a>Julius Proculus gave out that Romulus was taken up by Jupiter
into heaven, and therefore to be ever after adored for a god amongst the
Romans. Syrophanes of Egypt had one only son, whom he dearly loved; he
erected his statue in his house, which his servants did adorn with
garlands, to pacify their master's wrath when he was angry, so by little
and little he was adored for a god. This did Semiramis for her husband
Belus, and Adrian the emperor by his minion Antinous. Flora was a rich
harlot in Rome, and for that she made the commonwealth her heir, her
birthday was solemnised long after; and to make it a more plausible
holiday, they made her goddess of flowers, and sacrificed to her amongst
the rest. The matrons of Rome, as Dionysius Halicarnassaeus relates, because
at their entreaty Coriolanus desisted from his wars, consecrated a church
<span lang="la">Fortunes muliebri</span>; and <a href="#note6513">[6513]</a>Venus Barbata had a temple erected, for that
somewhat was amiss about hair, and so the rest. The citizens <a href="#note6514">[6514]</a>of
Alabanda, a small town in Asia Minor, to curry favour with the Romans (who
then warred in Greece with Perseus of Macedon, and were formidable to these
parts), consecrated a temple to the City of Rome, and made her a goddess,
with annual games and sacrifices; so a town of houses was deified, with
shameful flattery of the one side to give, and intolerable arrogance on the
other to accept, upon so vile and absurd an occasion. Tully writes to
Atticus, that his daughter Tulliola might be made a goddess, and adored as
Juno and Minerva, and as well she deserved it. Their holy days and
adorations were all out as ridiculous; those Lupercals of Pan, Florales of
Flora, Bona dea, Anna Perenna, Saturnals, &amp;c., as how they were celebrated,
with what lascivious and wanton gestures, bald ceremonies, <a href="#note6515">[6515]</a>by what
bawdy priests, how they hang their noses over the smoke of sacrifices,
saith <a href="#note6516">[6516]</a>Lucian, and lick blood like flies that was spilled about the
altars. Their carved idols, gilt images of wood, iron, ivory, silver,
brass, stone, <span lang="la">olim truncus eram</span>, &amp;c., were most absurd, as being their
own workmanship; for as Seneca notes, <span lang="la">adorant ligneos deos, et fabros
interim qui fecerunt, contemnunt</span>, they adore work, contemn the workman;
and as Tertullian follows it, <span lang="la">Si homines non essent diis propitii, non
essent dii</span>, had it not been for men, they had never been gods, but blocks,
and stupid statues in which mice, swallows, birds make their nests, spiders
their webs, and in their very mouths laid their excrements. Those images, I
say, were all out as gross as the shapes in which they did represent them:
Jupiter with a ram's head, Mercury a dog's, Pan like a goat, Heccate with
three heads, one with a beard, another without; see more in Carterius and
<a href="#note6517">[6517]</a>Verdurius of their monstrous forms and ugly pictures: and, which was
absurder yet, they told them these images came from heaven, as that of
Minerva in her temple at Athens, <span lang="la">quod e coelo cecidisse credebant
accolae</span>, saith Pausanias. They formed some like storks, apes, bulls, and
yet seriously believed: and that which was impious and abominable, they
made their gods notorious whoremasters, incestuous Sodomites (as commonly
they were all, as well as Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Mercury, Neptune, &amp;c.),
thieves, slaves, drudges (for Apollo and Neptune made tiles in Phrygia),
kept sheep, Hercules emptied stables, Vulcan a blacksmith, unfit to dwell
upon the earth for their villainies, much less in heaven, as <a href="#note6518">[6518]</a>Mornay well
saith, and yet they gave them out to be such; so weak and brutish, some to
whine, lament, and roar, as Isis for her son and Cenocephalus, as also all
her weeping priests; Mars in Homer to be wounded, vexed; Venus ran away
crying, and the like; than which what can be more ridiculous? <span lang="la">Nonne
ridiculum lugere quod colas, vel colere quod lugeas</span>? (which <a href="#note6519">[6519]</a>Minutius
objects) <span lang="la">Si dii, cur plangitis? si mortui, cur adoratis</span>? that it is no
marvel if <a href="#note6520">[6520]</a>Lucian, that adamantine persecutor of superstition, and Pliny
could so scoff at them and their horrible idolatry as they did; if Diagoras
took Hercules' image, and put it under his pot to seethe his pottage, which
was, as he said, his 13th labour. But see more of their fopperies in Cypr.

Lamentable, tragical, and fearful those symptoms are, that they should be
so far forth affrighted with their fictitious gods, as to spend the goods,
lives, fortunes, precious time, best days in their honour, to <a href="#note6521">[6521]</a>sacrifice
unto them, to their inestimable loss, such hecatombs, so many thousand
sheep, oxen with gilded horns, goats, as <a href="#note6522">[6522]</a>Croesus, king of Lydia, <a href="#note6523">[6523]</a>
Marcus Julianus, surnamed <span lang="la">ob crebras hostias Victimarius, et Tauricremus</span>,
and the rest of the Roman emperors usually did with such labour and cost;
and not emperors only and great ones, <span lang="la">pro communi bono</span>, were at this
charge, but private men for their ordinary occasions. Pythagoras offered a
hundred oxen for the invention of a geometrical problem, and it was an
ordinary thing to sacrifice in <a href="#note6524">[6524]</a>Lucian's time, <q>a heifer for their good
health, four oxen for wealth, a hundred for a kingdom, nine bulls for their
safe return from Troja to Pylus,</q> &amp;c. Every god almost had a peculiar
sacrifice&mdash;the Sun horses, Vulcan fire, Diana a white hart, Venus a turtle,
Ceres a hog, Proserpine a black lamb, Neptune a bull (read more in <a href="#note6525">[6525]</a>
Stuckius at large), besides sheep, cocks, corals, frankincense, to their
undoings, as if their gods were affected with blood or smoke. <q>And surely</q>
(<a href="#note6526">[6526]</a>saith he) <q>if one should but repeat the fopperies of mortal men, in
their sacrifices, feasts, worshipping their gods, their rites and
ceremonies, what they think of them, of their diet, houses, orders, &amp;c.,
what prayers and vows they make; if one should but observe their absurdity
and madness, he would burst out a laughing, and pity their folly.</q> For what
can be more absurd than their ordinary prayers, petitions, <a href="#note6527">[6527]</a>requests,
sacrifices, oracles, devotions? of which we have a taste in Maximus Tyrius,
<span class="cite">serm. 1.</span> Plato's Alcibiades Secundus, Persius <span class="cite">Sat. 2.</span> Juvenal. <span class="cite">Sat.
10.</span> there likewise exploded, <span lang="la">Mactant opimas et pingues hostias deo quasi
esurienti, profundunt vina tanquam sitienti, lumina accendunt velut in
tenebris agenti</span> (Lactantius, <span class="cite">lib. 2. cap. 6</span>). As if their gods were
hungry, athirst, in the dark, they light candles, offer meat and drink. And
what so base as to reveal their counsels and give oracles, <span lang="la">e viscerum
sterquiliniis</span>, out of the bowels and excremental parts of beasts?
<span lang="la">sordidos deos</span> Varro truly calls them therefore, and well he might. I say
nothing of their magnificent and sumptuous temples, those majestical
structures: to the roof of Apollo Didymeus' temple, <span lang="la">ad branchidas</span>, as
<a href="#note6528">[6528]</a>Strabo writes, a thousand oaks did not suffice. Who can relate the
glorious splendour, and stupend magnificence, the sumptuous building of
Diana at Ephesus, Jupiter Ammon's temple in Africa, the Pantheon at Rome,
the Capitol, the Sarapium at Alexandria, Apollo's temple at Daphne in the
suburbs of Antioch. The great temple at Mexico so richly adorned, and so
capacious (for 10,000 men might stand in it at once), that fair Pantheon of
Cusco, described by Acosta in his Indian History, which eclipses both Jews
and Christians. There were in old Jerusalem, as some write, 408 synagogues;
but new Cairo reckons up (if <a href="#note6529">[6529]</a>Radzivilus may be believed) 6800 mosques;
Fez 400, whereof 50 are most magnificent, like St. Paul's in London. Helena
built 300 fair churches in the Holy Land, but one Bassa hath built 400
mosques. The Mahometans have 1000 monks in a monastery; the like saith
Acosta of Americans; Riccius of the Chinese, for men and women, fairly
built; and more richly endowed some of them, than Arras in Artois, Fulda in
Germany, or St. Edmund's-Bury in England with us: who can describe those
curious and costly statues, idols, images, so frequently mentioned in
Pausanias? I conceal their donaries, pendants, other offerings, presents,
to these their fictitious gods daily consecrated. <a href="#note6530">[6530]</a>Alexander, the son
of Amyntas, king of Macedonia, sent two statues of pure gold to Apollo at
Delphos. <a href="#note6531">[6531]</a>Croesus, king of Lydia dedicated a hundred golden tiles in
the same place with a golden altar: no man came empty-handed to their
shrines. But these are base offerings in respect; they offered men
themselves alive. The Leucadians, as Strabo writes, sacrificed every year a
man, <span lang="la">averruncandae, deorum irae, causa</span>, to pacify their gods, <span lang="la">de montis
praecipitio dejecerent</span>, &amp;c. and they did voluntarily undergo it. The Decii
did so sacrifice, <span lang="la">Diis manibus</span>; Curtius did leap into the gulf. Were they
not all strangely deluded to go so far to their oracles, to be so gulled by
them, both in war and peace, as Polybius relates (which their argurs,
priests, vestal virgins can witness), to be so superstitious, that they
would rather lose goods and lives than omit any ceremonies, or offend their
heathen gods? Nicias, that generous and valiant captain of the Greeks,
overthrew the Athenian navy, by reason of his too much superstition, <a href="#note6532">[6532]</a>
because the augurs told him it was ominous to set sail from the haven of
Syracuse whilst the moon was eclipsed; he tarried so long till his enemies
besieged him, he and all his army were overthrown. The <a href="#note6533">[6533]</a>Parthians of
old were so sottish in this kind, they would rather lose a victory, nay
lose their own lives, than fight in the night, 'twas against their
religion. The Jews would make no resistance on the Sabbath, when Pompeius
besieged Jerusalem; and some Jewish Christians in Africa, set upon by the
Goths, suffered themselves upon the same occasion to be utterly vanquished.
The superstition of the Dibrenses, a bordering town in Epirus, besieged by
the Turks, is miraculous almost to report. Because a dead dog was flung
into the only fountain which the city had, they would die of thirst all,
rather than drink of that <a href="#note6534">[6534]</a>unclean water, and yield up the city upon
any conditions. Though the praetor and chief citizens began to drink first,
using all good persuasions, their superstition was such, no saying would
serve, they must all forthwith die or yield up the city. <span lang="la">Vix ausum ipse
credere</span> (saith <a href="#note6535">[6535]</a>Barletius) <span lang="la">tantam superstitionem, vel affirmare
levissimam hanc causam tantae rei vel magis ridiculam, quum non dubitem
risum potius quum admirationem posteris excitaturam.</span> The story was too
ridiculous, he was ashamed to report it, because he thought nobody would
believe it. It is stupend to relate what strange effects this idolatry and
superstition hath brought forth of the latter years in the Indies and those
bordering parts: <a href="#note6536">[6536]</a>in what feral shapes the <a href="#note6537">[6537]</a>devil is adored, <span lang="la">ne
quid mali intentent</span>, as they say; for in the mountains betwixt Scanderoon
and Aleppo, at this day, there are dwelling a certain kind of people called
Coords, coming of the race of the ancient Parthians, who worship the devil,
and allege this reason in so doing: God is a good man and will do no harm,
but the devil is bad and must be pleased, lest he hurt them. It is
wonderful to tell how the devil deludes them, how he terrifies them, how
they offer men and women sacrifices unto him, a hundred at once, as they
did infants in Crete to Saturn of old, the finest children, like
Agamemnon's Iphigenia, &amp;c. At <a href="#note6538">[6538]</a>Mexico, when the Spaniards first
overcame them, they daily sacrificed <span lang="la">viva hominum corda e viventium
corporibus extracta</span>, the hearts of men yet living, 20,000 in a year
(Acosta <span class="cite">lib. 5. cap. 20</span>) to their idols made of flour and men's blood,
and every year 6000 infants of both sexes: and as prodigious to relate,
<a href="#note6539">[6539]</a>how they bury their wives with husbands deceased, 'tis fearful to
report, and harder to believe,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6540">[6540]</a>Nam certamen habent laethi quae viva sequatur</div>
<div class="line">Conjugium, pudor, est non licuisse mori,</div>
</div>
and burn them alive, best goods, servants, horses, when a grandee dies,
<a href="#note6541">[6541]</a>twelve thousand at once amongst the Tartar's, when a great Cham
departs, or an emperor in America: how they plague themselves, which
abstain from all that hath life, like those old Pythagoreans, with
immoderate fastings, <a href="#note6542">[6542]</a>as the Bannians about Surat, they of China, that
for superstition's sake never eat flesh nor fish all their lives, never
marry, but live in deserts and by-places, and some pray to their idols
twenty-four hours together without any intermission, biting of their
tongues when they have done, for devotion's sake. Some again are brought to
that madness by their superstitious priests (that tell them such vain
stories of immortality, and the joys of heaven in that other life), <a href="#note6543">[6543]</a>
that many thousands voluntarily break their own necks, as Cleombrotus
Amborciatus, auditors of old, precipitate themselves, that they may
participate of that unspeakable happiness in the other world. One poisons,
another strangles himself, and the King of China had done as much, deluded
with the vain hope, had he not been detained by his servant. But who can
sufficiently tell of their several superstitions, vexations, follies,
torments? I may conclude with <a href="#note6544">[6544]</a>Possevinus, <span lang="la">Religifacit asperos mites,
homines e feris; superstitio ex hominibus feras</span>, religion makes wild
beasts civil, superstition makes wise men beasts and fools; and the
discreetest that are, if they give way to it, are no better than dizzards;
nay more, if that of Plotinus be true, <span lang="la">is unus religionis scopus, ut ei
quem colimus similes fiamus</span>, that is the drift of religion to make us like
him whom we worship: what shall be the end of idolaters, but to degenerate
into stocks and stones? of such as worship these heathen gods, for <span lang="la">dii
gentium daemonia</span>, <a href="#note6545">[6545]</a>but to become devils themselves? 'Tis therefore
<span lang="la">exitiosus error, et maxime periculosus</span>, a most perilous and dangerous
error of all others, as <a href="#note6546">[6546]</a>Plutarch holds, <span lang="la">turbulenta passio hominem
consternans</span>, a pestilent, a troublesome passion, that utterly undoeth men.
Unhappy superstition, <a href="#note6547">[6547]</a>Pliny calls it, <span lang="la">morte non finitur</span>, death takes
away life, but not superstition. Impious and ignorant are far more happy
than they which are superstitious, no torture like to it, none so
continuate, so general, so destructive, so violent.

<p>In this superstitious row, Jews for antiquity may go next to Gentiles: what
of old they have done, what idolatries they have committed in their groves
and high places, what their Pharisees, Sadducees, Scribes, Essei, and such
sectaries have maintained, I will not so much as mention: for the present,
I presume no nation under heaven can be more sottish, ignorant, blind,
superstitious, wilful, obstinate, and peevish, tiring themselves with vain
ceremonies to no purpose; he that shall but read their Rabbins' ridiculous
comments, their strange interpretation of scriptures, their absurd
ceremonies, fables, childish tales, which they steadfastly believe, will
think they be scarce rational creatures; their foolish <a href="#note6548">[6548]</a>customs, when
they rise in the morning, and how they prepare themselves to prayer, to
meat, with what superstitious washings, how to their Sabbath, to their
other feasts, weddings, burials, &amp;c. Last of all, the expectation of their
Messiah, and those figments, miracles, vain pomp that shall attend him, as
how he shall terrify the Gentiles, and overcome them by new diseases; how
Michael the archangel shall sound his trumpet, how he shall gather all the
scattered Jews in the Holy Land, and there make them a great banquet, <a href="#note6549">[6549]</a>
<q>Wherein shall be all the birds, beasts, fishes, that ever God made, a cup
of wine that grew in Paradise, and that hath been kept in Adam's cellar
ever since.</q> At the first course shall be served in that great ox in <span class="bibcite">Job
iv. 10.</span>, <q>that every day feeds on a thousand hills,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psal. 1. 10.</span>, that
great Leviathan, and a great bird, that laid an egg so big, <a href="#note6550">[6550]</a><q>that by
chance tumbling out of the nest, it knocked down three hundred tall cedars,
and breaking as it fell, drowned one hundred and sixty villages:</q> this bird
stood up to the knees in the sea, and the sea was so deep, that a hatchet
would not fall to the bottom in seven years: of their Messiah's <a href="#note6551">[6551]</a>wives
and children; Adam and Eve, &amp;c., and that one stupend fiction amongst the
rest: when a Roman prince asked of rabbi Jehosua ben Hanania, why the Jews'
God was compared to a lion; he made answer, he compared himself to no
ordinary lion, but to one in the wood Ela, which, when he desired to see,
the rabbin prayed to God he might, and forthwith the lion set forward. <a href="#note6552">[6552]</a>
<q>But when he was four hundred miles from Rome he so roared that all the
great-bellied women in Rome made abortions, the city walls fell down, and
when he came a hundred miles nearer, and roared the second time, their
teeth fell out of their heads, the emperor himself fell down dead, and so
the lion went back.</q> With an infinite number of such lies and forgeries,
which they verily believe, feed themselves with vain hope, and in the mean
time will by no persuasions be diverted, but still crucify their souls with
a company of idle ceremonies, live like slaves and vagabonds, will not be
relieved or reconciled.

<p>Mahometans are a compound of Gentiles, Jews, and Christians, and so absurd
in their ceremonies, as if they had taken that which is most sottish out of
every one of them, full of idle fables in their superstitious law, their
Alcoran itself a gallimaufry of lies, tales, ceremonies, traditions,
precepts, stolen from other sects, and confusedly heaped up to delude a
company of rude and barbarous clowns. As how birds, beasts, stones, saluted
Mahomet when he came from Mecca, the moon came down from heaven to visit
him, <a href="#note6553">[6553]</a>how God sent for him, spake to him, &amp;c., with a company of
stupend figments of the angels, sun, moon, and stars, &amp;c. Of the day of
judgment, and three sounds to prepare to it, which must last fifty thousand
years of Paradise, which wholly consists in <span lang="la">coeundi et comedendi
voluptate</span>, and <span lang="la">pecorinis hominibus scriptum, bestialis beatitudo</span>, is so
ridiculous, that Virgil, Dante, Lucian, nor any poet can be more fabulous.
Their rites and ceremonies are most vain and superstitious, wine and
swine's flesh are utterly forbidden by their law, <a href="#note6554">[6554]</a>they must pray five
times a day; and still towards the south, wash before and after all their
bodies over, with many such. For fasting, vows, religious orders,
peregrinations, they go far beyond any papists, <a href="#note6555">[6555]</a>they fast a month
together many times, and must not eat a bit till sun be set. Their
kalendars, dervises, and torlachers, &amp;c. are more <a href="#note6556">[6556]</a>abstemious some of
them, than Carthusians, Franciscans, Anchorites, forsake all, live
solitary, fare hard, go naked, &amp;c. <a href="#note6557">[6557]</a>Their pilgrimages are as far as to
the river <a href="#note6558">[6558]</a>Ganges (which the Gentiles of those tracts likewise do), to
wash themselves, for that river as they hold hath a sovereign virtue to
purge them of all sins, and no man can be saved that hath not been washed
in it. For which reason they come far and near from the Indies; <span lang="la">Maximus
gentium omnium confluxus est</span>; and infinite numbers yearly resort to it.
Others go as far as Mecca to Mahomet's tomb, which journey is both
miraculous and meritorious. The ceremonies of flinging stones to stone the
devil, of eating a camel at Cairo by the way; their fastings, their running
till they sweat, their long prayers, Mahomet's temple, tomb, and building
of it, would ask a whole volume to dilate: and for their pains taken in
this holy pilgrimage, all their sins are forgiven, and they reputed for so
many saints. And diverse of them with hot bricks, when they return, will
put out their eyes, <a href="#note6559">[6559]</a><q>that they never after see any profane thing, bite
out their tongues,</q> &amp;c. They look for their prophet Mahomet as Jews do for
their Messiah. Read more of their customs, rites, ceremonies, in Lonicerus
<span class="cite">Turcic. hist. tom. 1.</span> from the tenth to the twenty-fourth chapter.
Bredenbachius, <span class="cite">cap. 4, 5, 6.</span> Leo Afer, <span class="cite">lib. 1.</span> Busbequius Sabellicus,
Purchas, <span class="cite">lib. 3. cap. 3, et 4, 5.</span> Theodorus Bibliander, &amp;c. Many
foolish ceremonies you shall find in them; and which is most to be
lamented, the people are generally so curious in observing of them, that if
the least circumstance be omitted, they think they shall be damned, 'tis an
irremissible offence, and can hardly be forgiven. I kept in my house
amongst my followers (saith Busbequius, sometime the Turk's orator in
Constantinople) a Turkey boy, that by chance did eat shellfish, a meat
forbidden by their law, but the next day when he knew what he had done, he
was not only sick to cast and vomit, but very much troubled in mind, would
weep and <a href="#note6560">[6560]</a>grieve many days after, torment himself for his foul offence.
Another Turk being to drink a cup of wine in his cellar, first made a huge
noise and filthy faces, <a href="#note6561">[6561]</a><q>to warn his soul, as he said, that it should
not be guilty of that foul fact which he was to commit.</q> With such toys as
these are men kept in awe, and so cowed, that they dare not resist, or
offend the least circumstance of their law, for conscience' sake misled by
superstition, which no human edict otherwise, no force of arms, could have
enforced.

<p>In the last place are pseudo-Christians, in describing of whose
superstitious symptoms, as a mixture of the rest, I may say that which St.
Benedict once saw in a vision, one devil in the marketplace, but ten in a
monastery, because there was more work; in populous cities they would swear
and forswear, lie, falsify, deceive fast enough of themselves, one devil
could circumvent a thousand; but in their religious houses a thousand
devils could scarce tempt one silly monk. All the principal devils, I
think, busy themselves in subverting Christians; Jews, Gentiles, and
Mahometans, are <span lang="la">extra caulem</span>, out of the fold, and need no such
attendance, they make no resistance, <a href="#note6562">[6562]</a><span lang="la">eos enim pulsare negligit, quos
quieto jure possidere se sentit</span>, they are his own already: but Christians
have that shield of faith, sword of the Spirit to resist, and must have a
great deal of battery before they can be overcome. That the devil is most
busy amongst us that are of the true church, appears by those several
oppositions, heresies, schisms, which in all ages he hath raised to subvert
it, and in that of Rome especially, wherein Antichrist himself now sits and
plays his prize. This mystery of iniquity began to work even in the
Apostles' time, many Antichrists and heretics' were abroad, many sprung up
since, many now present, and will be to the world's end, to dementate men's
minds, to seduce and captivate their souls. Their symptoms I know not how
better to express, than in that twofold division, of such as lead, and are
led. Such as lead are heretics, schismatics, false prophets, impostors, and
their ministers: they have some common symptoms, some peculiar. Common, as
madness, folly, pride, insolency, arrogancy, singularity, peevishness,
obstinacy, impudence, scorn and contempt of all other sects: <span lang="la">Nullius
addicti jurare in verba magistri</span>; <a href="#note6563">[6563]</a>they will approve of nought but
what they first invent themselves, no interpretation good but what their
infallible spirit dictates: none shall be <span lang="la">in secundis</span>, no not <span lang="la">in
tertiis</span>, they are only wise, only learned in the truth, all damned but
they and their followers, <span lang="la">caedem scripturarum faciunt ad materiam suam</span>,
saith Tertullian, they make a slaughter of Scriptures, and turn it as a
nose of wax to their own ends. So irrefragable, in the mean time, that what
they have once said, they must and will maintain, in whole tomes,
duplications, triplications, never yield to death, so self-conceited, say
what you can. As <a href="#note6564">[6564]</a>Bernard (erroneously some say) speaks of P. Aliardus,
<span lang="la">omnes patres sic, atque ego sic.</span> Though all the Fathers, Councils, the
whole world contradict it, they care not, they are all one: and as <a href="#note6565">[6565]</a>
Gregory well notes <q>of such as are vertiginous, they think all turns round
and moves, all err: when as the error is wholly in their own brains.</q>
Magallianus, the Jesuit, in his Comment on 1 Tim. xvi. 20, and Alphonsus
<span class="cite">de castro lib. 1. adversus haereses</span>, gives two more eminent notes or
probable conjectures to know such men by, (they might have taken themselves
by the noses when they said it) <a href="#note6566">[6566]</a><q>First they affect novelties and toys,
and prefer falsehood before truth; <a href="#note6567">[6567]</a>secondly, they care not what they
say, that which rashness and folly hath brought out, pride afterward,
peevishness and contumacy shall maintain to the last gasp.</q> Peculiar
symptoms are prodigious paradoxes, new doctrines, vain phantasms, which are
many and diverse as they themselves. <a href="#note6568">[6568]</a>Nicholaites of old, would have
wives in common: Montanists will not marry at all, nor Tatians, forbidding
all flesh, Severians wine; Adamians go naked, <a href="#note6569">[6569]</a>because Adam did so in
Paradise; and some <a href="#note6570">[6570]</a>barefoot all their lives, because God, <span class="bibcite">Exod. iii.</span>
and <span class="bibcite">Joshua v.</span> bid Moses so to do; and Isaiah <span class="bibcite">xx.</span> was bid put off his shoes;
Manichees hold that Pythagorean transmigration of souls from men to beasts;
<a href="#note6571">[6571]</a><q>the Circumcellions in Africa, with a mad cruelty made away
themselves, some by fire, water, breaking their necks, and seduced others
to do the like, threatening some if they did not,</q> with a thousand such; as
you may read in <a href="#note6572">[6572]</a>Austin (for there were fourscore and eleven heresies
in his times, besides schisms and smaller factions) Epiphanius, Alphonsus
<span lang="la">de Castro, Danaeus, Gab, Prateolus</span>, &amp;c. Of prophets, enthusiasts and
impostors, our Ecclesiastical stories afford many examples; of Elias and
Christs, as our <a href="#note6573">[6573]</a>Eudo <span lang="la">de stellis</span>, a Briton in King Stephen's time,
that went invisible, translated himself from one to another in a moment,
fed thousands with good cheer in the wilderness, and many such; nothing so
common as miracles, visions, revelations, prophecies. Now what these
brain-sick heretics once broach, and impostors set on foot, be it never so
absurd, false, and prodigious, the common people will follow and believe.
It will run along like murrain in cattle, scab in sheep. <span lang="la">Nulla scabies</span>,
as <a href="#note6574">[6574]</a>he said, <span lang="la">superstitione scabiosior</span>; as he that is bitten with a
mad dog bites others, and all in the end become mad; either out of
affection of novelty, simplicity, blind zeal, hope and fear, the
giddy-headed multitude will embrace it, and without further examination
approve it.

<p><span lang="la">Sed vetera querimur</span>, these are old, <span lang="la">haec prius fuere.</span> In our days we
have a new scene of superstitious impostors and heretics. A new company of
actors, of Antichrists, that great Antichrist himself: a rope of hopes,
that by their greatness and authority bear down all before them: who from
that time they proclaimed themselves universal bishops, to establish their
own kingdom, sovereignty, greatness, and to enrich themselves, brought in
such a company of human traditions, purgatory, <span lang="la">Limbus Patrum, Infantum</span>,
and all that subterranean geography, mass, adoration of saints, alms,
fastings, bulls, indulgences, orders, friars, images, shrines, musty
relics, excommunications, confessions, satisfactions, blind obediences,
vows, pilgrimages, peregrinations, with many such curious toys, intricate
subtleties, gross errors, obscure questions, to vindicate the better and
set a gloss upon them, that the light of the Gospel was quite eclipsed,
darkness over all, the Scriptures concealed, legends brought in, religion
banished, hypocritical superstition exalted, and the Church itself <a href="#note6575">[6575]</a>
obscured and persecuted: Christ and his members crucified more, saith
Benzo, by a few necromantical, atheistical popes, than ever it was by <a href="#note6576">[6576]</a>
Julian the Apostate, Porphyrius the Platonist, Celsus the physician,
Libanius the Sophister; by those heathen emperors, Huns, Goths, and
Vandals. What each of them did, by what means, at what times, <span lang="la">quibus
auxiliis</span>, superstition climbed to this height, tradition increased, and
Antichrist himself came to his estate, let Magdeburgenses, Kemnisius,
Osiander, Bale, Mornay, Fox, Usher, and many others relate. In the mean
time, he that shall but see their profane rites and foolish customs, how
superstitiously kept, how strictly observed, their multitude of saints,
images, that rabble of Romish deities, for trades, professions, diseases,
persons, offices, countries, places; St. George for England; St. Denis for
France, Patrick, Ireland; Andrew, Scotland; Jago, Spain; &amp;c. Gregory for
students; Luke for painters; Cosmus and Damian for philosophers; Crispin,
shoemakers; Katherine, spinners; &amp;c. Anthony for pigs; Gallus, geese;
Wenceslaus, sheep; Pelagius, oxen; Sebastian, the plague; Valentine,
falling sickness; Apollonia, toothache; Petronella for agues; and the
Virgin Mary for sea and land, for all parties, offices: he that shall
observe these things, their shrines, images, oblations, pendants,
adorations, pilgrimages they make to them, what creeping to crosses, our
Lady of Loretto's rich <a href="#note6577">[6577]</a>gowns, her donaries, the cost bestowed on
images, and number of suitors; St. Nicholas Burge in France; our St.
Thomas's shrine of old at Canterbury; those relics at Rome, Jerusalem,
Genoa, Lyons, Pratum, St. Denis; and how many thousands come yearly to
offer to them, with what cost, trouble, anxiety, superstition (for forty
several masses are daily said in some of their <a href="#note6578">[6578]</a>churches, and they rise
at all hours of the night to mass, come barefoot, &amp;c.), how they spend
themselves, times, goods, lives, fortunes, in such ridiculous observations;
their tales and figments, false miracles, buying and selling of pardons,
indulgences for 40,000 years to come, their processions on set days, their
strict fastings, monks, anchorites, friar mendicants, Franciscans,
Carthusians, &amp;c. Their vigils and fasts, their ceremonies at Christmas,
Shrovetide, Candlemas, Palm Sunday, Blaise, St. Martin, St. Nicholas' day;
their adorations, exorcisms, &amp;c., will think all those Grecian, Pagan,
Mahometan superstitions, gods, idols, and ceremonies, the name, time and
place, habit only altered, to have degenerated into Christians. Whilst they
prefer traditions before Scriptures; those Evangelical Councils, poverty,
obedience, vows, alms, fasting, supererogations, before God's Commandments;
their own ordinances instead of his precepts, and keep them in ignorance,
blindness, they have brought the common people into such a case by their
cunning conveyances, strict discipline, and servile education, that upon
pain of damnation they dare not break the least ceremony, tradition, edict;
hold it a greater sin to eat a bit of meat in Lent, than kill a man: their
consciences are so terrified, that they are ready to despair if a small
ceremony be omitted; and will accuse their own father, mother, brother,
sister, nearest and dearest friends of heresy, if they do not as they do,
will be their chief executioners, and help first to bring a faggot to burn
them. What mulct, what penance soever is enjoined, they dare not but do it,
tumble with St. Francis in the mire amongst hogs, if they be appointed, go
woolward, whip themselves, build hospitals, abbeys, &amp;c., go to the East or
West Indies, kill a king, or run upon a sword point: they perform all,
without any muttering or hesitation, believe all.

And whilst the ruder sort are so carried headlong with blind zeal, are so
gulled and tortured by their superstitions, their own too credulous
simplicity and ignorance, their epicurean popes and hypocritical cardinals
laugh in their sleeves, and are merry in their chambers with their punks,
they do <span lang="la">indulgere genio</span>, and make much of themselves. The middle sort,
some for private gain, hope of ecclesiastical preferment, (<span lang="la">quis expedivit

believe all their paradoxes and absurd tenets, without exception, and as
obstinately maintain and put in practice all their traditions and
idolatrous ceremonies (for their religion is half a trade) to the death;
they will defend all, the golden legend itself, with all the lies and tales
in it: as that of St. George, St. Christopher, St. Winifred, St. Denis, &amp;c.
It is a wonder to see how Nic. Harpsfield, that Pharisaical impostor,
amongst the rest, Ecclesiast. Hist. <span class="cite">cap. 22. saec prim, sex.</span>, puzzles
himself to vindicate that ridiculous fable of St. Ursula and the eleven
thousand virgins, as when they live,<a href="#note6580">[6580]</a>how they came to Cologne, by whom
martyred, &amp;c., though he can say nothing for it, yet he must and will
approve it: <span lang="la">nobilitavit (inquit) hoc saeculum Ursula cum comitibus, cujus
historia utinam tam mihi esset expedita et certa, quam in animo meo certum
ac expeditum est, eam esse cum sodalibus beatam in coelis virginem.</span> They
must and will (I say) either out of blind zeal believe, vary their compass
with the rest, as the latitude of religion varies, apply themselves to the
times, and seasons, and for fear and flattery are content to subscribe and
to do all that in them lies to maintain and defend their present government
and slavish religious schoolmen, canonists, Jesuits, friars, priests,
orators, sophisters, who either for that they had nothing else to do,
luxuriant wits knew not otherwise how to busy themselves in those idle
times, for the Church then had few or no open adversaries, or better to
defend their lies, fictions, miracles, transubstantiations, traditions,
pope's pardons, purgatories, masses, impossibilities, &amp;c. with glorious
shows, fair pretences, big words, and plausible wits, have coined a
thousand idle questions, nice distinctions, subtleties, Obs and Sols, such
tropological, allegorical expositions, to salve all appearances,
objections, such quirks and quiddities, <span lang="la">quodlibetaries</span>, as Bale saith of
Ferribrigge and Strode, instances, ampliations, decrees, glosses, canons,
that instead of sound commentaries, good preachers, are come in a company
of mad sophisters, <span lang="la">primo secundo secundarii</span>, sectaries, Canonists,
Sorbonists, Minorites, with a rabble of idle controversies and questions,
<a href="#note6581">[6581]</a><span lang="la">an Papa sit Deus, an quasi Deus? An participet utramque Christi
naturam</span>? Whether it be as possible for God to be a humble bee or a gourd,
as a man? Whether he can produce respect without a foundation or term, make
a whore a virgin? fetch Trajan's soul from hell, and how? with a rabble of
questions about hell-fire: whether it be a greater sin to kill a man, or to
clout shoes upon a Sunday? whether God can make another God like unto
himself? Such, saith Kemnisius, are most of your schoolmen, (mere
alchemists) 200 commentators on Peter Lambard; (<span lang="la">Pitsius catal. scriptorum
Anglic.</span> reckons up 180 English commentators alone, on the matter of the
sentences), Scotists, Thomists, Reals, Nominals, &amp;c., and so perhaps that
of St. <a href="#note6582">[6582]</a>Austin may be verified. <span lang="la">Indocti rapiunt coelum, docti interim
descendunt ad infernum.</span> Thus they continued in such error, blindness,
decrees, sophisms, superstitions; idle ceremonies and traditions were the
sum of their new-coined holiness and religion, and by these knaveries and
stratagems they were able to involve multitudes, to deceive the most
sanctified souls, and, if it were possible, the very elect. In the mean
time the true Church, as wine and water mixed, lay hid and obscure to speak
of, till Luther's time, who began upon a sudden to defecate, and as another
sun to drive away those foggy mists of superstition, to restore it to that
purity of the primitive Church. And after him many good and godly men,
divine spirits, have done their endeavours, and still do.

at, as a stone-horse when he meets a bear: they make matters of conscience
of them, and will rather forsake their livings than subscribe to them. They
will admit of no holidays, or honest recreations, as of hawking, hunting,
&amp;c., no churches, no bells some of them, because papists use them; no
discipline, no ceremonies but what they invent themselves; no
interpretations of 'scriptures, no comments of fathers, no councils, but
such as their own fantastical spirits dictate, or <span lang="la">recta ratio</span>, as
Socinians, by which spirit misled, many times they broach as prodigious
paradoxes as papists themselves. Some of them turn prophets, have secret
revelations, will be of privy council with God himself, and know all his
secrets, <a href="#note6585">[6585]</a><span lang="la"> Per capillos spiritum sanctum tenent, et omnia sciunt cum
sint asini omnium obstinatissimi</span>, a company of giddy heads will take upon
them to define how many shall be saved and who damned in a parish, where
they shall sit in heaven, interpret Apocalypses, (<span lang="la">Commentatores praecipites
et vertiginosos</span>, one calls them, as well he might) and those hidden
mysteries to private persons, times, places, as their own spirit informs
them, private revelations shall suggest, and precisely set down when the
world shall come to an end, what year, what month, what day. Some of them
again have such strong faith, so presumptuous, they will go into infected
houses, expel devils, and fast forty days, as Christ himself did; some call
God and his attributes into question, as Vorstius and Socinus; some
princes, civil magistrates, and their authorities, as Anabaptists, will do
all their own private spirit dictates, and nothing else. Brownists,
Barrowists, Familists, and those Amsterdamian sects and sectaries, are led
all by so many private spirits. It is a wonder to reveal what passages
Sleidan relates in his Commentaries, of Cretinck, Knipperdoling, and their
associates, those madmen of Munster in Germany; what strange enthusiasms,
sottish revelations they had, how absurdly they carried themselves, deluded
others; and as profane Machiavel in his political disputations holds of
Christian religion, in general it doth enervate, debilitate, take away
men's spirits and courage from them, <span lang="la">simpliciores reddit homines</span>, breeds
nothing so courageous soldiers as that Roman: we may say of these peculiar
sects, their religion takes away not spirits only, but wit and judgment,
and deprives them of their understanding; for some of them are so far gone
with their private enthusiasms and revelations, that they are quite mad,
out of their wits. What greater madness can there be, than for a man to
take upon him to be a God, as some do? to be the Holy Ghost, Elias, and
what not? In <a href="#note6586">[6586]</a>Poland, 1518, in the reign of King Sigismund, one said he
was Christ, and got him twelve apostles, came to judge the world, and
strangely deluded the commons. <a href="#note6587">[6587]</a>One David George, an illiterate
painter, not many years since, did as much in Holland, took upon him to be
the Messiah, and had many followers. Benedictus Victorinus Faventinus,
<span class="cite">consil. 15</span>, writes as much of one Honorius, that thought he was not only
inspired as a prophet, but that he was a God himself, and had <a href="#note6588">[6588]</a>familiar
conference with God and his angels. Lavat. <span class="cite">de spect. c. 2. part. 8.</span> hath
a story of one John Sartorious, that thought he was the prophet Elias, and
<span class="cite">cap. 7.</span> of diverse others that had conference with angels, were saints,
prophets. Wierus, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de Lamiis c. 7.</span> makes mention of a prophet of
Groning that said he was God the Father; of an Italian and Spanish prophet
that held as much. We need not rove so far abroad, we have familiar
examples at home: Hackett that said he was Christ; Coppinger and Arthington
his disciples; <a href="#note6589">[6589]</a>Burchet and Hovatus, burned at Norwich. We are never
likely seven years together without some such new prophets that have
several inspirations, some to convert the Jews, some fast forty days, go
with Daniel to the lion's den; some foretell strange things, some for one
thing, some for another. Great precisians of mean conditions and very
illiterate, most part by a preposterous zeal, fasting, meditation,
melancholy, are brought into those gross errors and inconveniences. Of
those men I may conclude generally, that howsoever they may seem to be
discreet, and men of understanding in other matters, discourse well, <span lang="la">laesam
habent imaginationem</span>, they are like comets, round in all places but where
they blaze, <span lang="la">caetera sani</span>, they have impregnable wits many of them, and
discreet otherwise, but in this their madness and folly breaks out beyond
measure, <span lang="la">in infinitum erumpit stultitia.</span> They are certainly far gone with
melancholy, if not quite mad, and have more need of physic than many a man
that keeps his bed, more need of hellebore than those that are in Bedlam.

<h4><a name="3.4.1.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Prognostics of Religious Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>You may guess at the prognostics by the symptoms. What can these signs fore
tell otherwise than folly, dotage, madness, gross ignorance, despair,
obstinacy, a reprobate sense, <a href="#note6590">[6590]</a>a bad end? What else can superstition,
heresy produce, but wars, tumults, uproars, torture of souls, and despair,
a desolate land, as Jeremy teacheth, <span class="bibcite">cap. vii. 34.</span> when they commit
idolatry, and walk after their own ways? how should it be otherwise with
them? what can they expect but <q>blasting, famine, dearth,</q> and all the
plagues of Egypt, as Amos denounceth, <span class="bibcite">cap. iv. vers. 9. 10</span>. to be led
into captivity? If our hopes be frustrate, <q>we sow much and bring in
little, eat and have not enough, drink and are not filled, clothe and be
not warm,</q> &amp;c. <span class="bibcite">Haggai i. 6.</span> <q>we look for much and it comes to little, whence
is it? His house was waste, they came to their own houses,</q> <span class="bibcite">vers. 9.</span>
<q>therefore the heaven stayed his dew, the earth his fruit.</q> Because we are
superstitious, irreligious, we do not serve God as we ought, all these
plagues and miseries come upon us; what can we look for else but mutual
wars, slaughters, fearful ends in this life, and in the life to come
eternal damnation? What is it that hath caused so many feral battles to be
fought, so much Christian blood shed, but superstition! That Spanish
inquisition, racks, wheels, tortures, torments, whence do they proceed?
from superstition. Bodine the Frenchman, in his <a href="#note6591">[6591]</a><span class="cite">method. hist.</span>
accounts Englishmen barbarians, for their civil wars: but let him read
those Pharsalian fields <a href="#note6592">[6592]</a>fought of late in France for their religion,
their massacres, wherein by their own relations in twenty-four years, I
know not how many millions have been consumed, whole families and cities,
and he shall find ours to be but velitations to theirs. But it hath ever
been the custom of heretics and idolaters, when they are plagued for their
sins, and God's just judgments come upon them, not to acknowledge any fault
in themselves, but still impute it unto others. In Cyprian's time it was
much controverted between him and Demetrius an idolater, who should be the
cause of those present calamities. Demetrius laid all the fault on
Christians, (and so they did ever in the primitive church, as appears by
the first book of <a href="#note6593">[6593]</a>Arnobius), <a href="#note6594">[6594]</a><q>that there were not such ordinary
showers in winter, the ripening heat in summer, so seasonable springs,
fruitful autumns, no marble mines in the mountains, less gold and silver
than of old; that husbandmen, seamen, soldiers, all were scanted, justice,
friendship, skill in arts, all was decayed,</q> and that through Christians'
default, and all their other miseries from them, <span lang="la">quod dii nostri a vobis
non colantur</span>, because they did not worship their gods. But Cyprian retorts
all upon him again, as appears by his tract against him. 'Tis true the
world is miserably tormented and shaken with wars, dearth, famine, fire,
inundations, plagues, and many feral diseases rage amongst us, <span lang="la">sed non ut
tu quereris ista accidunt quod dii vestri a nobis non colantur, sed quod a
vobis non colatur Deus, a quibus nec quaeritur, nec timetur</span>, not as thou
complainest, that we do not worship your Gods, but because you are
idolaters, and do not serve the true God, neither seek him, nor fear him as
you ought. Our papists object as much to us, and account us heretics, we
them; the Turks esteem of both as infidels, and we them as a company of
pagans, Jews against all; when indeed there is a general fault in us all,
and something in the very best, which may justly deserve God's wrath, and
pull these miseries upon our heads. I will say nothing here of those vain
cares, torments, needless works, penance, pilgrimages, pseudomartyrdom, &amp;c.
We heap upon ourselves unnecessary troubles, observations; we punish our
bodies, as in Turkey (saith <a href="#note6595">[6595]</a>Busbequius <span class="cite">leg. Turcic. ep. 3.</span>) <q>one did,
that was much affected with music, and to hear boys sing, but very
superstitious; an old sibyl coming to his house, or a holy woman,</q> (as that
place yields many) <q>took him down for it, and told him, that in that other
world he should suffer for it; thereupon he flung his rich and costly
instruments which he had bedecked with jewels, all at once into the fire.
He was served in silver plate, and had goodly household stuff: a little
after, another religious man reprehended him in like sort, and from
thenceforth he was served in earthen vessels, last of all a decree came
forth, because Turks might not drink wine themselves, that neither Jew nor
Christian then living in Constantinople, might drink any wine at all.</q> In
like sort amongst papists, fasting at first was generally proposed as a
good thing; after, from such meats at set times, and then last of all so
rigorously proposed, to bind the consciences upon pain of damnation. <q>First
Friday,</q> saith Erasmus, <q>then Saturday,</q> <span lang="la">et nunc periclitatur dies
Mercurii</span>) and Wednesday now is in danger of a fast. <a href="#note6596">[6596]</a><q>And for such
like toys, some so miserably afflict themselves, to despair, and death
itself, rather than offend, and think themselves good Christians in it,
when as indeed they are superstitious Jews.</q> So saith Leonardus Fuchsius, a
great physician in his time. <a href="#note6597">[6597]</a><q>We are tortured in Germany with these
popish edicts, our bodies so taken down, our goods so diminished, that if
God had not sent Luther, a worthy man, in time, to redress these mischiefs,
we should have eaten hay with our horses before this.</q> <a href="#note6598">[6598]</a>As in fasting,
so in all other superstitious edicts, we crucify one another without a
cause, barring ourselves of many good and lawful things, honest disports,
pleasures and recreations; for wherefore did God create them but for our
use? Feasts, mirth, music, hawking, hunting, singing, dancing, &amp;c. <span lang="la">non tam
necessitatibus nostris Deus inservit, sed in delicias amamur</span>, as Seneca
notes, God would have it so. And as Plato <span class="cite">2. de legibus</span> gives out, <span lang="la">Deos
laboriosam hominum vitam miseratos</span>, the gods in commiseration of human
estate sent Apollo, Bacchus, and the Muses, <span lang="la">qui cum voluptate tripudia et
soltationes nobis ducant</span>, to be merry with mortals, to sing and dance with
us. So that he that will not rejoice and enjoy himself, making good use of
such things as are lawfully permitted, <span lang="la">non est temperatus</span>, as he will,
<span lang="la">sed superstitiosus.</span> <q>There is nothing better for a man, than that he
should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his
labour,</q> <span class="bibcite">Eccles. ii. 24.</span> And as <a href="#note6599">[6599]</a>one said of hawking and hunting, <span lang="la">tot
solatia in hac aegri orbis calamitate, mortalibus taediis deus objecit</span>, I
say of all honest recreations, God hath therefore indulged them to refresh,
ease, solace and comfort us. But we are some of us too stern, too rigid,
too precise, too grossly superstitious, and whilst we make a conscience of
every toy, with touch not, taste not, &amp;c., as those Pythagoreans of old,
and some Indians now, that will eat no flesh, or suffer any living creature
to be killed, the Bannians about Guzzerat; we tyrannise over our brother's
soul, lose the right use of many good gifts; honest <a href="#note6600">[6600]</a>sports, games and
pleasant recreations, <a href="#note6601">[6601]</a>punish ourselves without a cause, lose our
liberties, and sometimes our lives. Anno 1270, at <a href="#note6602">[6602]</a>Magdeburg in
Germany, a Jew fell into a privy upon a Saturday, and without help could
not possibly get out; he called to his fellows for succour, but they denied
it, because it was their Sabbath, <span lang="la">non licebat opus manuum exercere</span>; the
bishop hearing of it, the next day forbade him to be pulled out, because it
was our Sunday. In the mean time the wretch died before Monday. We have
myriads of examples in this kind amongst those rigid Sabbatarians, and
therefore not without good cause, <a href="#note6603">[6603]</a><span lang="la">Intolerabilem pertubationem</span> Seneca
calls it, as well he might, an intolerable perturbation, that causeth such
dire events, folly, madness, sickness, despair, death of body and soul, and
hell itself.

<h4><a name="3.4.1.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Cure of Religious Melancholy</i>.</h4>

<p>To purge the world of idolatry and superstition, will require some
monster-taming Hercules, a divine Aesculapius, or Christ himself to come in
his own person, to reign a thousand years on earth before the end, as the
Millenaries will have him. They are generally so refractory,
self-conceited, obstinate, so firmly addicted to that religion in which
they have been bred and brought up, that no persuasion, no terror, no
persecution, can divert them. The consideration of which, hath induced many
commonwealths to suffer them to enjoy their consciences as they will
themselves: a toleration of Jews is in most provinces of Europe. In Asia
they have their synagogues: Spaniards permit Moors to live amongst them:
the Mogullians, Gentiles: the Turks all religions. In Europe, Poland and
Amsterdam are the common sanctuaries. Some are of opinion, that no man
ought to be compelled for conscience' sake, but let him be of what religion
he will, he may be saved, as Cornelius was formerly accepted, Jew, Turks,
Anabaptists, &amp;c. If he be an honest man, live soberly, and civilly in his
profession, (Volkelius, Crellius, and the rest of the Socinians, that now
nestle themselves about Krakow and Rakow in Poland, have renewed this
opinion) serve his own God, with that fear and reverence as he ought. <span lang="la">Sua
cuique civitati</span> (Laeli) <span lang="la">religio sit, nostra nobis</span>, Tully thought fit
every city should be free in this behalf, adore their own <span lang="la">Custodes et
Topicos Deos</span>, tutelar and local gods, as Symmachus calls them. Isocrates
adviseth Demonicus, <q>when he came to a strange city, to <a href="#note6604">[6604]</a>worship by all
means the gods of the place,</q> <span lang="la">et unumquemque, Topicum deum sic coli
oportere, quomodo ipse praeceperit</span>: which Cecilius in <a href="#note6605">[6605]</a>Minutius
labours, and would have every nation <span lang="la">sacrorum ritus gentiles habere et
deos colere municipes</span>, keep their own ceremonies, worship their peculiar
gods, which Pomponius Mela reports of the Africans, <span lang="la">Deos suos patrio more
venerantur</span>, they worship their own gods according to their own ordination.
For why should any one nation, as he there pleads, challenge that
universality of God, <span lang="la">Deum suum quem nec ostendunt, nec vident,
discurrantem silicet et ubique praesentem, in omnium mores, actus, et
occultas, cogitationes inquirentem</span>, &amp;c., as Christians do: let every
province enjoy their liberty in this behalf, worship one God, or all as
they will, and are informed. The Romans built altars Diis Asiae, Europae,
Lybiae, <span lang="la">diis ignotis et peregrinis</span>: others otherwise, &amp;c. Plinius
Secundus, as appears by his Epistle to Trajan, would not have the
Christians so persecuted, and in some time of the reign of Maximinus, as we
find it registered in Eusebius <span class="cite">lib. 9. cap. 9.</span> there was a decree made
to this purpose, <span lang="la">Nullus cogatur invitus ad hunc vel illum deorum cultum</span>,
<q>let no one be compelled against his will to worship any particular deity,</q>
and by Constantine in the 19th year of his reign as <a href="#note6606">[6606]</a>Baronius informeth
us, <span lang="la">Nemo alteri exhibeat molestiam, quod cujusque animus vult, hoc quisque
transigat</span>, new gods, new lawgivers, new priests, will have new ceremonies,
customs and religions, to which every wise man as a good formalist should
accommodate himself.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6607">[6607]</a>Saturnus periit, perierunt et sua jura,</div>
<div class="line">Sub Jove nunc mundus, jussa sequare Jovis.</div>
</div>
The said Constantine the emperor, as Eusebius writes, flung down and
demolished all the heathen gods, silver, gold statues, altars, images and
temples, and turned them all to Christian churches, <span lang="la">infestus gentilium
monumentis ludibrio exposuit</span>; the Turk now converts them again to
Mahometan mosques. The like edict came forth in the reign of Arcadius and
Honorius. <a href="#note6608">[6608]</a>Symmachus the orator in his days, to procure a general
toleration, used this argument, <a href="#note6609">[6609]</a><q>Because God is immense and infinite,
and his nature cannot perfectly be known, it is convenient he should be as
diversely worshipped, as every man shall perceive or understand.</q> It was
impossible, he thought, for one religion to be universal: you see that one
small province can hardly be ruled by one law, civil or spiritual; and <q>how
shall so many distinct and vast empires of the world be united into one? It
never was, never will be</q> Besides, if there be infinite planetary and
firmamental worlds, as <a href="#note6610">[6610]</a>some will, there be infinite genii or
commanding spirits belonging to each of them; and so, <span lang="la">per consequens</span> (for
they will be all adored), infinite religions. And therefore let every
territory keep their proper rites and ceremonies, as their <span lang="la">dii tutelares</span>
will, so Tyrius calls them, <q>and according to the quarter they hold,</q> their
own institutions, revelations, orders, oracles, which they dictate from
time to time, or teach their own priests or ministers. This tenet was
stiffly maintained in Turkey not long since, as you may read in the third
epistle of Busbequius, <a href="#note6611">[6611]</a><q>that all those should participate of eternal
happiness, that lived a holy and innocent life, what religion soever they
professed.</q> Rustan Bassa was a great patron of it; though Mahomet himself
was sent <span lang="la">virtute gladdi</span>, to enforce all, as he writes in his Alcoran, to
follow him. Some again will approve of this for Jews, Gentiles, infidels,
that are out of the fold, they can be content to give them all respect and
favour, but by no means to such as are within the precincts of our own
church, and called Christians, to no heretics, schismatics, or the like;
let the Spanish inquisition, that fourth fury, speak of some of them, the
civil wars and massacres in France, our Marian times. <a href="#note6612">[6612]</a>Magillianus the
Jesuit will not admit of conference with a heretic, but severity and rigour
to be used, <span lang="la">non illis verba reddere, sed furcas, figere oportet</span>; and
Theodosius is commended in Nicephorus, <span class="cite">lib. 12. cap. 15.</span> <a href="#note6613">[6613]</a><q>That he
put all heretics to silence.</q> Bernard. <span class="cite">Epist. 180</span>, will have club law, fire
and sword for heretics, <a href="#note6614">[6614]</a><q>compel them, stop their mouths not with
disputations, or refute them with reasons, but with fists;</q> and this is
their ordinary practice. Another company are as mild on the other side; to
avoid all heart-burning, and contentious wars and uproars, they would have
a general toleration in every kingdom, no mulct at all, no man for religion
or conscience be put to death, which <a href="#note6615">[6615]</a>Thuanus the French historian much
favours; our late Socinians defend; Vaticanus against Calvin in a large
Treatise in behalf of Servetus, vindicates; Castilio, &amp;c., Martin Ballius
and his companions, maintained this opinion not long since in France, whose
error is confuted by Beza in a just volume. The medium is best, and that
which Paul prescribes, <span class="bibcite">Gal. i.</span> <q>If any man shall fall by occasion, to
restore such a one with the spirit of meekness, by all fair means, gentle
admonitions;</q> but if that will not take place, <span lang="la">Post unam et alteram
admonitionem haereticum devita</span>, he must be excommunicate, as Paul did by
Hymenaeus, delivered over to Satan. <span lang="la">Immedicabile vulnus ense recidendum
est.</span> As Hippocrates said in physic, I may well say in divinity, <span lang="la">Quae ferro
non curantur, ignis curat.</span> For the vulgar, restrain them by laws, mulcts,
burn their books, forbid their conventicles; for when the cause is taken
away, the effect will soon cease. Now for prophets, dreamers, and such rude
silly fellows, that through fasting, too much meditation, preciseness, or
by melancholy, are distempered: the best means to reduce them <span lang="la">ad sanam
mentem</span>, is to alter their course of life, and with conference, threats,
promises, persuasions, to intermix physic. Hercules de Saxonia, had such a
prophet committed to his charge in Venice, that thought he was Elias, and
would fast as he did; he dressed a fellow in angel's attire, that said he
came from heaven to bring him divine food, and by that means stayed his
fast, administered his physic; so by the meditation of this forged angel he
was cured. <a href="#note6616">[6616]</a>Rhasis an Arabian, <span class="cite">cont. lib. 1. cap. 9</span>, speaks of a fellow
that in like case complained to him, and desired his help: <q>I asked him</q>
(saith he) <q>what the matter was; he replied, I am continually meditating of
heaven and hell, and methinks I see and talk with fiery spirits, and smell
brimstone, &amp;c., and am so carried away with these conceits, that I can
neither eat, nor sleep, nor go about my business: I cured him</q> (saith
Rhasis) <q>partly by persuasion, partly by physic, and so have I done by many
others.</q> We have frequently such prophets and dreamers amongst us, whom we
persecute with fire and faggot: I think the most compendious cure, for some
of them at least, had been in Bedlam. <span lang="la">Sed de his satis.</span>

<p><span lang="la">Tempora labuntur, tacitisque senescimus annis</span>.<a href="#note6628">[6628]</a> For the rest of heaven and hell, let children and superstitious
fools believe it: for their parts, they are so far from trembling at the
dreadful day of judgment that they wish with Nero, <span lang="la">Me vivo fiat</span>, let it
come in their times: so secure, so desperate, so immoderate in lust and
pleasure, so prone to revenge that, as Paterculus said of some caitiffs in
his time in Rome, <span lang="la">Quod nequiter ausi, fortiter executi</span>: it shall not be
so wickedly attempted, but as desperately performed, whatever they take in
hand. Were it not for God's restraining grace, fear and shame, temporal
punishment, and their own infamy, they would. Lycaon-like exenterate, as so
many cannibals eat up, or Cadmus' soldiers consume one another. These are
most impious, and commonly professed atheists, that never use the name of
God but to swear by it; that express nought else but epicurism in their
carriage, or hypocrisy; with Pentheus they neglect and contemn these rites
and religious ceremonies of the gods; they will be gods themselves, or at
least <span lang="la">socii deorum. Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet.</span> <q>Caesar
divides the empire with Jove.</q> Aproyis, an Egyptian tyrant, grew, saith
<a href="#note6629">[6629]</a>Herodotus, to that height of pride, insolency of impiety, to that
contempt of Gods and men, that he held his kingdom so sure, <span lang="la">ut a nemine
deorum aut hominum sibi eripi posset</span>, neither God nor men could take it
from him. <a href="#note6630">[6630]</a>A certain blasphemous king of Spain (as <a href="#note6631">[6631]</a>Lansius reports)
made an edict, that no subject of his, for ten years' space, should believe
in, call on, or worship any god. And as <a href="#note6632">[6632]</a>Jovius relates of <q>Mahomet the
Second, that sacked Constantinople, he so behaved himself, that he believed
neither Christ nor Mahomet; and thence it came to pass, that he kept his
word and promise no farther than for his advantage, neither did he care to
commit any offence to satisfy his lust.</q> I could say the like of many
princes, many private men (our stories are full of them) in times past,
this present age, that love, fear, obey, and perform all civil duties as
they shall find them expedient or behoveful to their own ends. <span lang="la">Securi
adversus Deos, securi adversus homines, votis non est opus</span>, which <a href="#note6633">[6633]</a>
Tacitus reports of some Germans, they need not pray, fear, hope, for they
are secure, to their thinking, both from Gods and men. Bulco Opiliensis,
sometime Duke of <a href="#note6634">[6634]</a>Silesia, was such a one to a hair; he lived (saith
<a href="#note6635">[6635]</a>Aeneas Sylvius) at <a href="#note6636">[6636]</a>Vratislavia, <q>and was so mad to satisfy his lust,
that he believed neither heaven nor hell, or that the soul was immortal,
but married wives, and turned them up as he thought fit, did murder and
mischief, and what he list himself.</q> This duke hath too many followers in
our days: say what you can, dehort, exhort, persuade to the contrary, they
are no more moved,&mdash;<span lang="la">quam si dura, silex aut stet Marpesia cautes</span>,
than so many stocks, and stones; tell them of heaven and hell, 'tis to no
purpose, <span lang="la">laterem lavas</span>, they answer as Ataliba that Indian prince did
friar Vincent, <a href="#note6637">[6637]</a><q>when he brought him a book, and told him all the
mysteries of salvation, heaven and hell, were contained in it: he looked
upon it, and said he saw no such matter, asking withal, how he knew it:</q>
they will but scoff at it, or wholly reject it. Petronius in Tacitus, when
he was now by Nero's command bleeding to death, <span lang="la">audiebat amicos nihil
referentes de immortalitate animae, aut sapientum placitis, sed levia
carmina et faciles versus</span>; instead of good counsel and divine meditations,
he made his friends sing him bawdy verses and scurrilous songs. Let them
take heaven, paradise, and that future happiness that will, <span lang="la">bonum est esse
hic</span>, it is good being here: there is no talking to such, no hope of their
conversion, they are in a reprobate sense, mere carnalists, fleshly minded
men, which howsoever they may be applauded in this life by some few
parasites, and held for worldly wise men. <a href="#note6638">[6638]</a><q>They seem to me</q> (saith
Melancthon) <q>to be as mad as Hercules was when he raved and killed his wife
and children.</q> A milder sort of these atheistical spirits there are that
profess religion, but <span lang="la">timide et haesitanter</span>, tempted thereunto out of that
horrible consideration of diversity of religions, which are and have been
in the world (which argument Campanella, <span class="cite">Atheismi Triumphati, cap. 9.</span>
both urgeth and answers), besides the covetousness, imposture, and knavery
of priests, <span lang="la">quae faciunt</span> (as <a href="#note6639">[6639]</a>Postellus observes) <span lang="la">ut rebus sacris
minus faciant fidem</span>; and those religions some of them so fantastical,
exorbitant, so violently maintained with equal constancy and assurance;
whence they infer, that if there be so many religious sects, and denied by
the rest, why may they not be all false? or why should this or that be
preferred before the rest? The sceptics urge this, and amongst others it is
the conclusion of Sextus Empericus, <span class="cite">lib. 3. advers. Mathematicos</span>: after
many philosophical arguments and reasons pro and con that there are
gods, and again that there are no gods, he so concludes, <span lang="la">cum tot inter se
pugnent, &amp;c. Una tantum potest esse vera</span>, as Tully likewise disputes:
Christians say, they alone worship the true God, pity all other sects,
lament their case; and yet those old Greeks and Romans that worshipped the
devil, as the Chinese now do, <span lang="la">aut deos topicos</span>, their own gods; as Julian
the apostate, <a href="#note6640">[6640]</a>Cecilius in Minutius, Celsus and Porphyrius the
philosopher object: and as Machiavel contends, were much more noble,
generous, victorious, had a more flourishing commonwealth, better cities,
better soldiers, better scholars, better wits. Their gods overcame our
gods, did as many miracles, &amp;c. Saint Cyril, Arnobius, Minutius, with many
other ancients of late, Lessius, Morneus, Grotius <span class="cite">de Verit. Relig.
Christianae</span>, Savanarola <span class="cite">de Verit. Fidei Christianae</span>, well defend; but
Zanchius, <a href="#note6641">[6641]</a>Campanella, Marinus Marcennus, Bozius, and Gentillettus
answer all these atheistical arguments at large. But this again troubles
many as of old, wicked men generally thrive, professed atheists thrive,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6642">[6642]</a>Nullos esse Deos, inane coelum,</div>

<div class="line">Selius in public justifies;</div>
<div class="line">Because that whilst he thus denies</div>
<div class="line">Their deities, he better thrives.</div>
</div>
This is a prime argument: and most part your most sincere, upright, honest,
and <a href="#note6643">[6643]</a>good men are depressed, <q>The race is not to the swift, nor the
battle to the strong</q> (<span class="bibcite">Eccles. ix. 11.</span>), <q>nor yet bread to the wise, favour
nor riches to men of understanding, but time and chance comes to all.</q>
There was a great plague in Athens (as Thucydides, <span class="cite">lib. 2.</span> relates), in
which at last every man, with great licentiousness, did what he list, not
caring at all for God's or men's laws. <q>Neither the fear of God nor laws of
men</q> (saith he) <q>awed any man, because the plague swept all away alike, good
and bad; they thence concluded it was alike to worship or not worship the
gods, since they perished all alike.</q> Some cavil and make doubts of
scripture itself: it cannot stand with God's mercy, that so many should be
damned, so many bad, so few good, such have and hold about religions, all
stiff on their side, factious alike, thrive alike, and yet bitterly
persecuting and damning each other; <q>It cannot stand with God's goodness,
protection, and providence</q> (as <a href="#note6644">[6644]</a>Saint Chrysostom in the Dialect of such
discontented persons) <q>to see and suffer one man to be lame, another mad, a
third poor and miserable all the days of his life, a fourth grievously
tormented with sickness and aches, to his last hour. Are these signs and
works of God's providence, to let one man be deaf, another dumb? A poor
honest fellow lives in disgrace, woe and want, wretched he is; when as a
wicked caitiff abounds in superfluity of wealth, keeps whores, parasites,
and what he will himself:</q> <span lang="la">Audis Jupiter haec? Talia multa connectentes,
longum reprehensionis sermonem erga Dei providentiam contexunt.</span> <a href="#note6645">[6645]</a>Thus
they mutter and object (see the rest of their arguments in Marcennus in
Genesin, and in Campanella, amply confuted), with many such vain cavils,
well known, not worthy the recapitulation or answering: whatsoever they
pretend, they are <span lang="la">interim</span> of little or no religion.

<p>Cousin-germans to these men are many of our great philosophers and deists,
who, though they be more temperate in this life, give many good moral
precepts, honest, upright, and sober in their conversation, yet in effect
they are the same (accounting no man a good scholar that is not an
atheist), <span lang="la">nimis altum sapiunt</span>, too much learning makes them mad. Whilst
they attribute all to natural causes, <a href="#note6646">[6646]</a>contingence of all things, as
Melancthon calls them, <span lang="la">Pertinax hominum genus</span>, a peevish generation of
men, that misled by philosophy, and the devil's suggestion, their own
innate blindness, deny God as much as the rest, hold all religion a
fiction, opposite to reason and philosophy, though for fear of magistrates,
saith <a href="#note6647">[6647]</a>Vaninus, they durst not publicly profess it. Ask one of them of
what religion he is, he scoffingly replies, a philosopher, a Galenist, an
<a href="#note6648">[6648]</a>Averroist, and with Rabelais a physician, a peripatetic, an epicure. In
spiritual things God must demonstrate all to sense, leave a pawn with them,
or else seek some other creditor. They will acknowledge Nature and Fortune,
yet not God: though in effect they grant both: for as Scaliger defines,
Nature signifies God's ordinary power; or, as Calvin writes, Nature is
God's order, and so things extraordinary may be called unnatural: Fortune
his unrevealed will; and so we call things changeable that are beside
reason and expectation. To this purpose <a href="#note6649">[6649]</a>Minutius in <span class="cite">Octavio</span>, and <a href="#note6650">[6650]</a>
Seneca well discourseth with them, <span class="cite">lib. 4. de beneficiis, cap. 5, 6, 7.</span>
<q>They do not understand what they say; what is Nature but God? call him
what thou wilt, Nature, Jupiter, he hath as many names as offices: it comes
all to one pass, God is the fountain of all, the first Giver and Preserver,
from whom all things depend,</q> <a href="#note6651">[6651]</a><span lang="la">a quo, et per quem omnia, Nam quocunque
vides Deus est, quocunque moveris</span>, <q>God is all in all, God is everywhere,
in every place.</q> And yet this Seneca, that could confute and blame them, is
all out as much to be blamed and confuted himself, as mad himself; for he
holds <span lang="la">fatum Stoicum</span>, that inevitable Necessity in the other extreme, as
those Chaldean astrologers of old did, against whom the prophet Jeremiah so
often thunders, and those heathen mathematicians, Nigidius Figulus,
magicians, and Priscilianists, whom St. Austin so eagerly confutes, those
Arabian questionaries, Novem Judices, Albumazer, Dorotheus, &amp;c., and our
countryman <a href="#note6652">[6652]</a>Estuidus, that take upon them to define out of those great
conjunction of stars, with Ptolomeus, the periods of kingdoms, or
religions, of all future accidents, wars, plagues, schisms, heresies, and
what not? all from stars, and such things, saith Maginus, <span lang="la">Quae sibi et
intelligentiis suis reservavit Deus</span>, which God hath reserved to himself
and his angels, they will take upon them to foretell, as if stars were
immediate, inevitable causes of all future accidents. Caesar Vaninus, in his
book <span class="cite">de admirandis naturae Arcanis, dial. 52. de oraculis</span>, is more free,
copious, and open, in this explication of this astrological tenet of
Ptolemy, than any of our modern writers, Cardan excepted, a true disciple
of his master Pomponatius; according to the doctrine of Peripatetics, he
refers all apparitions, prodigies, miracles, oracles, accidents,
alterations of religions, kingdoms, &amp;c. (for which he is soundly lashed by
Marinus Mercennus, as well he deserves), to natural causes (for spirits he
will not acknowledge), to that light, motion, influences of heavens and
stars, and to the intelligences that move the orbs. <span lang="la">Intelligentia quae,
movet orbem mediante coelo</span>, &amp;c. Intelligences do all: and after a long
discourse of miracles done of old, <span lang="la">si haec daemones possint, cur non et
intelligentiae, coelorum motrices</span>? And as these great conjunctions, aspects
of planets, begin or end, vary, are vertical and predominant, so have
religions, rites, ceremonies, and kingdoms their beginning, progress,
periods, <span lang="la">in urbibus, regibus, religionibus, ac in particularibus
hominibus, haec vera ac manifesta, sunt, ut Aristoteles innuere videtur, et
quotidiana docet experientia, ut historias perlegens videbit; quid olim in
Gentili lege Jove sanctius et illustrius? quid nunc vile magis et
execrandum? Ita coelestia corpora pro mortalium beneficio religiones
aedificant, et cum cessat influxus, cessat lex</span>,<a href="#note6653">[6653]</a> &amp;c. And because,
according to their tenets, the world is eternal, intelligences eternal,
influences of stars eternal, kingdoms, religions, alterations shall be
likewise eternal, and run round after many ages; <span lang="la">Atque iterum ad Troiam
magnus mittetur Achilles; renascentur religiones, et ceremoniae, res humanae
in idem recident, nihil nunc quod non olim fuit, et post saeculorum
revolutiones alias est, erit,<a href="#note6654">[6654]</a>&amp;c. idem specie</span>, saith Vaninus, <span lang="la">non
individuo quod Plato significavit.</span> These (saith mine <a href="#note6655">[6655]</a>author), these
are the decrees of Peripatetics, which though I recite, <span lang="la">in obsequium
Christianae fidei detestor</span>, as I am a Christian I detest and hate. Thus
Peripatetics and astrologians held in former times, and to this effect of
old in Rome, saith Dionysius Halicarnassus, <span class="cite">lib. 7</span>, when those meteors
and prodigies appeared in the air, after the banishment of Coriolanus, <a href="#note6656">[6656]</a>
<q>Men were diversely affected: some said they were God's just judgments for
the execution of that good man, some referred all to natural causes, some
to stars, some thought they came by chance, some by necessity</q> decreed <span lang="la">ab
initio</span>, and could not be altered. The two last opinions of necessity and
chance were, it seems, of greater note than the rest.
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6657">[6657]</a>Sunt qui in Fortunae jam casibus omnia ponunt,</div>
<div class="line">Et mundum credunt nullo rectore moveri,</div>
<div class="line">Natura, volvente vices, &amp;c.</div>
</div>
<p>For the first of chance, as <a href="#note6658">[6658]</a>Sallust likewise informeth us, those old
Romans generally received; <q>They supposed fortune alone gave kingdoms and
empires, wealth, honours, offices: and that for two causes; first, because
every wicked base unworthy wretch was preferred, rich, potent, &amp;c.;
secondly, because of their uncertainty, though never so good, scarce any
one enjoyed them long: but after, they began upon better advice to think
otherwise, that every man made his own fortune.</q> The last of Necessity was
Seneca's tenet, that God was <span lang="la">alligatus causis secundis</span>, so tied to second
causes, to that inexorable Necessity, that he could alter nothing of that
which was once decreed; <span lang="la">sic erat in fatis</span>, it cannot be altered, <span lang="la">semel
jussit, semper paret Deus, nulla vis rumpit, nullae preces, nec ipsum
fulmen</span>, God hath once said it, and it must for ever stand good, no
prayers, no threats, nor power, nor thunder itself can alter it. Zeno,
Chrysippus, and those other Stoics, as you may read in Tully <span class="cite">2. de
divinatione</span>, Gellius, <span class="cite">lib. 6. cap. 2.</span> &amp;c., maintained as much. In all
ages, there have been such, that either deny God in all, or in part; some
deride him, they could have made a better world, and ruled it more orderly
themselves, blaspheme him, derogate at their pleasure from him. 'Twas so in
<a href="#note6659">[6659]</a>Plato's time, <q>Some say there be no gods, others that they care not
for men, a middle sort grant both.</q> <span lang="la">Si non sit Deus, unde mala? si sit
Deus, unde mala</span>? So Cotta argues in Tully, why made he not all good, or at
least tenders not the welfare of such as are good? As the woman told
Alexander, if he be not at leisure to hear causes, and redress them, why
doth he reign? <a href="#note6660">[6660]</a>Sextus Empericus hath many such arguments. Thus
perverse men cavil. So it will ever be, some of all sorts, good, bad,
indifferent, true, false, zealous, ambidexters, neutralists, lukewarm,
libertines, atheists, &amp;c. They will see these religious sectaries agree
amongst themselves, be reconciled all, before they will participate with,
or believe any: they think in the meantime (which <a href="#note6661">[6661]</a>Celsus objects, and
whom Origen confutes), <q>We Christians adore a person put to <a href="#note6662">[6662]</a>death with
no more reason than the barbarous Getes worshipped Zamolxis, the Cilicians
Mopsus, the Thebans Amphiaraus, and the Lebadians Trophonius; one religion
is as true as another, new fangled devices, all for human respects;</q>
great-witted Aristotle's works are as much authentical to them as
Scriptures, subtle Seneca's Epistles as canonical as St. Paul's, Pindarus'
Odes as good as the Prophet David's Psalms, Epictetus' Enchiridion
equivalent to wise Solomon's Proverbs. They do openly and boldly speak this
and more, some of them, in all places and companies. <a href="#note6663">[6663]</a><q>Claudius the
emperor was angry with Heaven, because it thundered, and challenged Jupiter
into the field; with what madness! saith Seneca; he thought Jupiter could
not hurt him, but he could hurt Jupiter.</q> Diagoras, Demonax, Epicurus,

atheists all</q> in their times: though not simple atheists neither, as
Cicogna proves, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 1.</span> they scoffed only at those Pagan gods,
their plurality, base and fictitious offices. Gilbertus Cognatus labours
much, and so doth Erasmus, to vindicate Lucian from scandal, and there be
those that apologise for Epicurus, but all in vain; Lucian scoffs at all,
Epicurus he denies all, and Lucretius his scholar defends him in it:

express words denies the immortality of the soul. <a href="#note6666">[6666]</a>Seneca doth little
less, <span class="cite">lib. 7. epist. 55. ad Lucilium, et lib. de consol. ad Martiam</span>, or
rather more. Some Greek Commentators would put as much upon Job, that he
should deny resurrection, &amp;c., whom Pineda copiously confutes in <span class="cite">cap. 7.
Job, vers. 9.</span> Aristotle is hardly censured of some, both divines and
philosophers. St. Justin <span class="cite">in Peraenetica ad Gentes</span>, Greg. Nazianzen. <span class="cite">in
disput. adversus Eun.</span>, Theodoret, <span class="cite">lib. 5. de curat. graec. affec.</span>, Origen.

least) <span class="cite">De immortalitate Animae</span>, Scaliger (who would forswear himself at
any time, saith Patritius, in defence of his great master Aristotle), and
Dandinus, <span class="cite">lib. 3. de anima</span>, acknowledge as much. Averroes oppugns all
spirits and supreme powers; of late Brunus (<span lang="la">infelix Brunus</span>, <a href="#note6667">[6667]</a>Kepler
calls him), Machiavel, Caesar Vaninus lately burned at Toulouse in France,
and Pet. Aretine, have publicly maintained such atheistical paradoxes,
<a href="#note6668">[6668]</a>with that Italian Boccaccio with his fable of three rings, &amp;c., <span lang="la">ex quo
infert haud posse internosci, quae sit verior religio, Judaica, Mahometana,
an Christiana, quoniam eadem signa</span>, &amp;c., <q>from which he infers, that it
cannot be distinguished which is the true religion, Judaism, Mahommedanism,
or Christianity,</q> &amp;c. <a href="#note6669">[6669]</a>Marinus Mercennus suspects Cardan for his
subtleties, Campanella, and Charron's Book of Wisdom, with some other
Tracts, to savour of <a href="#note6670">[6670]</a>atheism: but amongst the rest that pestilent book
<span class="cite">de tribus mundi impostoribus</span>, <span lang="la">quem sine horrore (inquit) non legas, et
mundi Cymbalum dialogis quatuor contentum, anno 1538, auctore Peresio,
Parisiis excusum</span>, <a href="#note6671">[6671]</a>&amp;c. And as there have been in all ages such
blasphemous spirits, so there have not been wanting their patrons,
protectors, disciples and adherents. Never so many atheists in Italy and
Germany, saith <a href="#note6672">[6672]</a>Colerus, as in this age: the like complaint Mercennus
makes in France, 50,000 in that one city of Paris. Frederic the Emperor, as
<a href="#note6673">[6673]</a>Matthew Paris records <span lang="la">licet non sit recitabile</span> (I use his own words)
is reported to have said, <span lang="la">Tres praestigiatores, Moses, Christus, et
Mahomet, uti mundo dominarentur, totum populum sibi contemporaneum se
duxisse.</span> (Henry, the Landgrave of Hesse, heard him speak it,) <span lang="la">Si
principes imperii institutioni meae adhaererent, ego multo meliorem modum
credendi et vivendi ordinarem.</span>

<p>To these professed atheists, we may well add that impious and carnal crew
of worldly-minded men, impenitent sinners, that go to hell in a lethargy,
or in a dream; who though they be professed Christians, yet they will
<span lang="la">nulla pallescere culpa</span>, make a conscience of nothing they do, they have
cauterised consciences, and are indeed in a reprobate sense, <q>past all
feeling, have given themselves over to wantonness, to work all manner of
uncleanness even with greediness,</q> <span class="bibcite">Ephes. iv. 19.</span> They do know there is a
God, a day of judgment to come, and yet for all that, as Hugo saith, <span lang="la">ita
comedunt ac dormiunt, ac si diem judicii evasissent; ita ludunt ac rident,
ac si in coelis cum Deo regnarent</span>: they are as merry for all the sorrow,

Those rude idiots and ignorant persons, that neglect and contemn the means
of their salvation, may march on with these; but above all others, those
Herodian temporizing statesmen, political Machiavellians and hypocrites,
that make a show of religion, but in their hearts laugh at it. <span lang="la">Simulata
sanctitas duplex iniquitas</span>; they are in a double fault, <q>that fashion
themselves to this world,</q> which <a href="#note6675">[6675]</a>Paul forbids, and like Mercury, the
planet, are good with good, bad with bad. When they are at Rome, they do
there as they see done, puritans with puritans, papists with papists;
<span lang="la">omnium horarum homines</span>, formalists, ambidexters, lukewarm Laodiceans.
<a href="#note6676">[6676]</a>All their study is to please, and their god is their commodity, their
labour to satisfy their lusts, and their endeavours to their own ends.
Whatsoever they pretend, or in public seem to do, <a href="#note6677">[6677]</a><q>With the fool in
their hearts, they say there is no God.</q> <span lang="la">Heus tu&mdash;de Jove quid sentis</span>?
<q>Hulloa! what is your opinion about a Jupiter?</q> Their words are as soft as
oil, but bitterness is in their hearts; like <a href="#note6678">[6678]</a>Alexander VI. so cunning
dissemblers, that what they think they never speak. Many of them are so
close, you can hardly discern it, or take any just exceptions at them; they
are not factious, oppressors as most are, no bribers, no simoniacal
contractors, no such ambitious, lascivious persons as some others are, no
drunkards, <span lang="la">sobrii solem vident orientem, sobrii vident occidentem</span>, they
rise sober, and go sober to bed, plain dealing, upright, honest men, they
do wrong to no man, and are so reputed in the world's esteem at least, very
zealous in religion, very charitable, meek, humble, peace-makers, keep all
duties, very devout, honest, well spoken of, beloved of all men: but he
that knows better how to judge, he that examines the heart, saith they are
hypocrites, <span lang="la">Cor dolo plenum; sonant vitium percussa maligne</span>, they are not
sound within. As it is with writers <a href="#note6679">[6679]</a>oftentimes, <span lang="la">Plus sanctimoniae, in
libello, quam libelli auctore</span>, more holiness is in the book than in the
author of it: so 'tis with them: many come to church with great Bibles,
whom Cardan said he could not choose but laugh at, and will now and then
<span lang="la">dare operam Augustino</span>, read Austin, frequent sermons, and yet professed
usurers, mere gripes, <span lang="la">tota vitae ratio epicurea est</span>; all their life is
epicurism and atheism, come to church all day, and lie with a courtesan at
night. <span lang="la">Qui curios simulant et Bacchanalia vivunt</span>, they have Esau's
hands, and Jacob's voice: yea, and many of those holy friars, sanctified
men, Cappam, saith Hierom, <span lang="la">et cilicium induunt, sed intus latronem
tegunt.</span> They are wolves in sheep's clothing, <span lang="la">Introrsum turpes, speciosi
pelle decora</span>, <q>Fair without, and most foul within.</q> <a href="#note6680">[6680]</a><span lang="la">Latet plerumque
sub tristi amictu lascivia, et deformis horror vili veste tegitur</span>;
ofttimes under a mourning weed lies lust itself, and horrible vices under a
poor coat. But who can examine all those kinds of hypocrites, or dive into
their hearts? ]f we may guess at the tree by the fruit, never so many as in
these days; show me a plain-dealing true honest man: <span lang="la">Et pudor, et
probitas, et timor omnis abest.</span> He that shall but look into their lives,
and see such enormous vices, men so immoderate in lust, unspeakable in
malice, furious in their rage, flattering and dissembling (all for their
own ends) will surely think they are not truly religious, but of an
obdurate heart, most part in a reprobate sense, as in this age. But let
them carry it as they will for the present, dissemble as they can, a time
will come when they shall be called to an account, their melancholy is at
hand, they pull a plague and curse upon their own heads, <span lang="la">thesaurisant iram
Dei.</span> Besides all such as are <span lang="la">in deos contumeliosi</span>, blaspheme, contemn,
neglect God, or scoff at him, as the poets feign of Salmoneus, that would
in derision imitate Jupiter's thunder, he was precipitated for his pains,
Jupiter <span lang="la">intonuit contra</span>, &amp;c. so shall they certainly rue it in the end,
(<a href="#note6681">[6681]</a><span lang="la">in se spuit, qui in coelum spuit</span>), their doom's at hand, and hell is
ready to receive them.

<p>Some are of opinion, that it is in vain to dispute with such atheistical
spirits in the meantime, 'tis not the best way to reclaim them. Atheism,
idolatry, heresy, hypocrisy, though they have one common root, that is
indulgence to corrupt affection, yet their growth is different, they have
divers symptoms, occasions, and must have several cures and remedies. 'Tis
true some deny there is any God, some confess, yet believe it not; a third
sort confess and believe, but will not live after his laws, worship and
obey him: others allow God and gods subordinate, but not one God, no such
general God, <span lang="la">non talem deum</span>, but several topic gods for several places,
and those not to persecute one another for any difference, as Socinus will,
but rather love and cherish.

<p>To describe them in particular, to produce their arguments and reasons,
would require a just volume, I refer them therefore that expect a more
ample satisfaction, to those subtle and elaborate treatises, devout and
famous tracts of our learned divines (schoolmen amongst the rest, and
casuists) that have abundance of reasons to prove there is a God, the
immortality of the soul, &amp;c., out of the strength of wit and philosophy
bring irrefragable arguments to such as are ingenuous and well disposed; at
the least, answer all cavils and objections to confute their folly and
madness, and to reduce them, <span lang="la">si fieri posset, ad sanam mentem</span>, to a
better mind, though to small purpose many times. Amongst others consult
with Julius Caesar Lagalla, professor of philosophy in Rome, who hath
written a large volume of late to confute atheists: of the immortality of
the soul, Hierom. Montanus <span class="cite">de immortalitate Animae</span>: Lelius Vincentius of
the same subject: Thomas Giaminus, and Franciscus Collius <span class="cite">de Paganorum
animabus post mortem</span>, a famous doctor of the Ambrosian College in Milan.
Bishop Fotherby in his Atheomastix, Doctor Dove, Doctor Jackson, Abernethy,
Corderoy, have written well of this subject in our mother tongue: in Latin,
Colerus, Zanchius, Palearius, Illyricus, <a href="#note6682">[6682]</a>Philippus, Faber Faventinus,
&amp;c. But <span lang="la">instar omnium</span>, the most copious confuter of atheists is Marinus
Mercennus in his Commentaries on Genesis: <a href="#note6683">[6683]</a>with Campanella's Atheismus
Triumphatus. He sets down at large the causes of this brutish passion,
(seventeen in number I take it) answers all their arguments and sophisms,
which he reduceth to twenty-six heads, proving withal his own assertion;
<q>There is a God, such a God, the true and sole God,</q> by thirty-five
reasons. His Colophon is how to resist and repress atheism, and to that
purpose he adds four especial means or ways, which who so will may
profitably peruse.

<h4><a name="3.4.2.2"></a>SUBSECT. II.&mdash;<i>Despair. Despairs, Equivocations, Definitions, Parties and Parts affected</i>.</h4>

<p>There be many kinds of desperation, whereof some be holy, some unholy, as
<a href="#note6684">[6684]</a>one distinguisheth; that unholy he defines out of Tully to be
<span lang="la">Aegritudinem animi sine ulla rerum expectatione meliore</span>, a sickness of the
soul without any hope or expectation of amendment; which commonly succeeds
fear; for whilst evil is expected, we fear: but when it is certain, we
despair. According to Thomas <span class="cite">2. 2ae. distinct. 40. art. 4.</span> it is
<span lang="la">Recessus a re desiderata, propter impossibilitatem existimatam</span>, a
restraint from the thing desired, for some impossibility supposed. Because
they cannot obtain what they would, they become desperate, and many times
either yield to the passion by death itself, or else attempt
impossibilities, not to be performed by men. In some cases, this desperate
humour is not much to be discommended, as in wars it is a cause many times
of extraordinary valour; as Joseph, <span class="cite">lib. 1. de bello Jud. cap. 14.</span> L.
Danaeus <span class="cite">in Aphoris. polit. pag. 226.</span> and many politicians hold. It makes
them improve their worth beyond itself, and of a forlorn impotent company
become conquerors in a moment. <span lang="la">Una salus victis nullam sperare salutem</span>,
<q>the only hope for the conquered is despair.</q> In such courses when they see
no remedy, but that they must either kill or be killed, they take courage,
and oftentimes, <span lang="la">praeter spem</span>, beyond all hope vindicate themselves.
Fifteen thousand Locrenses fought against a hundred thousand Crotonienses,
and seeing now no way but one, they must all die, <a href="#note6685">[6685]</a>thought they would
not depart unrevenged, and thereupon desperately giving an assault,
conquered their enemies. <span lang="la">Nec alia causa victoriae</span>, (saith Justin mine
author) <span lang="la">quam quod desperaverant.</span> William the Conqueror, when he first
landed in England, sent back his ships, that his soldiers might have no
hope of retiring back. <a href="#note6686">[6686]</a>Bodine excuseth his countrymen's overthrow at
that famous battle at Agincourt, in Henry the Fifth his time, (<span lang="la">cui
simile</span>, saith Froissard, <span lang="la">tota historia producere non possit</span>, which no
history can parallel almost, wherein one handful of Englishmen overthrew a
royal army of Frenchmen) with this refuge of despair, <span lang="la">pauci desperati</span>, a
few desperate fellows being compassed in by their enemies, past all hope of
life, fought like so many devils; and gives a caution, that no soldiers
hereafter set upon desperate persons, which <a href="#note6687">[6687]</a>after Frontinus and
Vigetius, Guicciardini likewise admonisheth, <span class="cite">Hypomnes. part. 2. pag.
25.</span> not to stop an enemy that is going his way. Many such kinds there are
of desperation, when men are past hope of obtaining any suit, or in despair
of better fortune; <span lang="la">Desperatio facit monachum</span>, as the saying is, and
desperation causeth death itself; how many thousands in such distress have
made away themselves, and many others? For he that cares not for his own,
is master of another man's life. A Tuscan soothsayer, as <a href="#note6688">[6688]</a>Paterculus
tells the story, perceiving himself and Fulvius Flaccus his dear friend,
now both carried to prison by Opimius, and in despair of pardon, seeing the
young man weep, <span lang="la">quin tu potius hoc inquit facis</span>, do as I do; and with
that knocked out his brains against the door-cheek, as he was entering into
prison, <span lang="la">protinusque illiso capite in capite in carceris januam effuso
cerebro expiravit</span>, and so desperate died. But these are equivocal,
improper. <q>When I speak of despair,</q> saith <a href="#note6689">[6689]</a>Zanchie, <q>I speak not of
every kind, but of that alone which concerns God. It is opposite to hope,
and a most pernicious sin, wherewith the devil seeks to entrap men.</q>
Musculus makes four kinds of desperation, of God, ourselves, our neighbour,
or anything to be done; but this division of his may be reduced easily to
the former: all kinds are opposite to hope, that sweet moderator of
passions, as Simonides calls it; I do not mean that vain hope which
fantastical fellows feign to themselves, which according to Aristotle is
<span lang="la">insomnium vigilantium</span>, a waking dream; but this divine hope which
proceeds from confidence, and is an anchor to a floating soul; <span lang="la">spes alit
agricolas</span>, even in our temporal affairs, hope revives us, but in spiritual
it farther animateth; and were it not for hope, <q>we of all others were the
most miserable,</q> as Paul saith, in this life; were it not for hope, the
heart would break; <q>for though they be punished in the sight of men,</q>
(<span class="bibcite">Wisdom iii. 4.</span>) yet is <q>their hope full of immortality:</q> yet doth it not
so rear, as despair doth deject; this violent and sour passion of despair,
is of all perturbations most grievous, as <a href="#note6690">[6690]</a>Patritius holds. Some divide
it into final and temporal; <a href="#note6691">[6691]</a>final is incurable, which befalleth
reprobates; temporal is a rejection of hope and comfort for a time, which
may befall the best of God's children, and it commonly proceeds <a href="#note6692">[6692]</a><q>from
weakness of faith,</q> as in David when he was oppressed he cried out, <q>O
Lord, thou hast forsaken me,</q> but this for a time. This ebbs and flows with
hope and fear; it is a grievous sin howsoever: although some kind of
despair be not amiss, when, saith Zanchius, we despair of our own means,
and rely wholly upon God: but that species is not here meant. This
pernicious kind of desperation is the subject of our discourse, <span lang="la">homicida
animae</span>, the murderer of the soul, as Austin terms it, a fearful passion,
wherein the party oppressed thinks he can get no ease but by death, and is
fully resolved to offer violence unto himself; so sensible of his burthen,
and impatient of his cross, that he hopes by death alone to be freed of his
calamity (though it prove otherwise), and chooseth with Job <span class="bibcite">vi. 8. 9. xvii.
5.</span> <q>Rather to be strangled and die, than to be in his bonds.</q> <a href="#note6693">[6693]</a>The part
affected is the whole soul, and all the faculties of it; there is a
privation of joy, hope, trust, confidence, of present and future good, and
in their place succeed fear, sorrow, &amp;c. as in the symptoms shall be shown.
The heart is grieved, the conscience wounded, the mind eclipsed with black
fumes arising from those perpetual terrors.

<h4><a name="3.4.2.3"></a>SUBSECT. III.&mdash;<i>Causes of Despair, the Devil, Melancholy, Meditation, Distrust, Weakness of Faith, Rigid Ministers, Misunderstanding Scriptures, Guilty Consciences, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>The principal agent and procurer of this mischief is the devil; those whom
God forsakes, the devil by his permission lays hold on. Sometimes he
persecutes them with that worm of conscience, as he did Judas, <a href="#note6694">[6694]</a>Saul,
and others. The poets call it Nemesis, but it is indeed God's just
judgment, <span lang="la">sero sed serio</span>, he strikes home at last, and setteth upon them
<q>as a thief in the night,</q> <span class="bibcite">1 Thes. ii.</span> <a href="#note6695">[6695]</a>This temporary passion made
David cry out, <q>Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in
thine heavy displeasure; for thine arrows have light upon me, &amp;c. there is
nothing sound in my flesh, because of thine anger.</q> Again, I roar for the
very grief of my heart: and <span class="bibcite">Psalm xxii.</span> <q>My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me, and art so far from my health, and the words of my crying? I
am like to water poured out, my bones are out of joint, mine heart is like
wax, that is molten in the midst of my bowels.</q> So <span class="bibcite">Psalm lxxxviii. 15</span> and
<span class="bibcite">16 vers.</span> and <span class="bibcite">Psalm cii.</span> <q>I am in misery at the point of death, from my
youth I suffer thy terrors, doubting for my life; thine indignations have
gone over me, and thy fear hath cut me off.</q> Job doth often complain in
this kind; and those God doth not assist, the devil is ready to try and
torment, <q>still seeking whom he may devour.</q> If he find them merry, saith
Gregory, <q>he tempts them forthwith to some dissolute act; if pensive and
sad, to a desperate end.</q> <span lang="la">Aut suadendo blanditur, aut minando terret</span>,
sometimes by fair means, sometimes again by foul, as he perceives men
severally inclined. His ordinary engine by which he produceth this effect,
is the melancholy humour itself, which is <span lang="la">balneum diaboli</span>, the devil's
bath; and as in Saul, those evil spirits get in <a href="#note6696">[6696]</a>as it were, and take
possession of us. Black choler is a shoeing-horn, a bait to allure them,
insomuch that many writers make melancholy an ordinary cause, and a symptom
of despair, for that such men are most apt, by reason of their ill-disposed
temper, to distrust, fear, grief, mistake, and amplify whatsoever they
preposterously conceive, or falsely apprehend. <span lang="la">Conscientia scrupulosa
nascitur ex vitio naturali, complexione melancholica</span> (saith Navarrus <span class="cite">cap.
27. num. 282. tom. 2. cas. conscien.</span>) The body works upon the mind, by
obfuscating the spirits and corrupted instruments, which <a href="#note6697">[6697]</a>Perkins
illustrates by simile of an artificer, that hath a bad tool, his skill is
good, ability correspondent, by reason of ill tools his work must needs be
lame and imperfect. But melancholy and despair, though often, do not always
concur; there is much difference: melancholy fears without a cause, this
upon great occasion; melancholy is caused by fear and grief, but this
torment procures them and all extremity of bitterness; much melancholy is
without affliction of conscience, as <a href="#note6698">[6698]</a>Bright and Perkins illustrate by
four reasons; and yet melancholy alone may be sometimes a sufficient cause
of this terror of conscience. <a href="#note6699">[6699]</a>Felix Plater so found it in his
observations, <span lang="la">e melancholicis alii damnatos se putant, Deo curae, non sunt,
nec praedestinati</span>, &amp;c. <q>They think they are not predestinate, God hath
forsaken them;</q> and yet otherwise very zealous and religious; and 'tis
common to be seen, <q>melancholy for fear of God's judgment and hell-fire,
drives men to desperation; fear and sorrow, if they be immoderate, end
often with it.</q> Intolerable pain and anguish, long sickness, captivity,
misery, loss of goods, loss of friends, and those lesser griefs, do
sometimes effect it, or such dismal accidents. <span lang="la">Si non statim relevantur</span>,
<a href="#note6700">[6700]</a>Mercennus, <span lang="la">dubitant an sit Deus</span>, if they be not eased forthwith, they
doubt whether there be any God, they rave, curse, <q>and are desperately mad
because good men are oppressed, wicked men flourish, they have not as they
think to their desert,</q> and through impatience of calamities are so
misaffected. Democritus put out his eyes, <span lang="la">ne malorum civium prosperos
videret successus</span>, because he could not abide to see wicked men prosper,
and was therefore ready to make away himself, as <a href="#note6701">[6701]</a>Agellius writes of
him. Felix Plater hath a memorable example in this kind, of a painter's
wife in Basil, that was melancholy for her son's death, and for melancholy
became desperate; she thought God would not pardon her sins, <a href="#note6702">[6702]</a><q>and for
four months still raved, that she was in hell-fire, already damned.</q> When
the humour is stirred up, every small object aggravates and incenseth it,
as the parties are addicted. <a href="#note6703">[6703]</a>The same author hath an example of a
merchant man, that for the loss of a little wheat, which he had over long
kept, was troubled in conscience, for that he had not sold it sooner, or
given it to the poor, yet a good scholar and a great divine; no persuasion
would serve to the contrary, but that for this fact he was damned: in other
matters Very judicious and discreet. Solitariness, much fasting, divine
meditation, and contemplations of God's judgments, most part accompany this
melancholy, and are main causes, as <a href="#note6704">[6704]</a>Navarrus holds; to converse with
such kinds of persons so troubled, is sufficient occasion of trouble to
some men. <span lang="la">Nonnulli ob longas inedias, studia et meditationes coelestes, de
rebus sacris et religione semper agitant</span>, &amp;c. Many, (saith P. Forestus)
through long fasting, serious meditations of heavenly things, fall into
such fits; and as Lemnius adds, <span class="cite">lib. 4. cap. 21</span>, <a href="#note6705">[6705]</a><q>If they be
solitary given, superstitious, precise, or very devout: seldom shall you
find a merchant, a soldier, an innkeeper, a bawd, a host, a usurer, so
troubled in mind, they have cheverel consciences that will stretch, they
are seldom moved in this kind or molested: young men and middle age are
more wild and less apprehensive; but old folks, most part, such as are
timorous and religiously given.</q> Pet. Forestus <span class="cite">observat. lib. 10. cap.
12. de morbis cerebri</span>, hath a fearful example of a minister, that through
precise fasting in Lent, and overmuch meditation, contracted this mischief,
and in the end became desperate, thought he saw devils in his chamber, and
that he could not be saved; he smelled nothing, as he said, but fire and
brimstone, was already in hell, and would ask them, still, if they did not
<a href="#note6706">[6706]</a>smell as much. I told him he was melancholy, but he laughed me to
scorn, and replied that he saw devils, talked with them in good earnest,
Would spit in my face, and ask me if 1 did not smell brimstone, but at last
he was by him cured. Such another story I find in Plater <span class="cite">observat. lib.
1.</span> A poor fellow had done some foul offence, and for fourteen days would
eat no meat, in the end became desperate, the divines about him could not
ease him, <a href="#note6707">[6707]</a>but so he died. Continual meditation of God's judgments
troubles many, <span lang="la">Multi ob timorem futuri judicii</span>, saith Guatinerius <span class="cite">cap.
5. tract. 15.</span> <span lang="la">et suspicionem desperabundi sunt.</span> David himself complains
that God's judgments terrified his soul, <span class="bibcite">Psalm cxix. part. 16. vers. 8.</span> <q>My
flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments.</q>
<span lang="la">Quoties diem illum cogito</span> (saith <a href="#note6708">[6708]</a>Hierome) <span lang="la">toto corpore
contremisco</span>, I tremble as often as I think of it. The terrible meditation
of hell-fire and eternal punishment much torments a sinful silly soul.
What's a thousand years to eternity? <span lang="la">Ubi moeror, ubi fletus, ubi dolor
sempiternus. Mors sine morte, finis sine fine</span>; a finger burnt by chance we
may not endure, the pain is so grievous, we may not abide an hour, a night
is intolerable; and what shall this unspeakable fire then be that burns for
ever, innumerable infinite millions of years, <span lang="la">in omne aevum in aeternum.</span> O

<p>This meditation terrifies these poor distressed souls, especially if their
bodies be predisposed by melancholy, they religiously given, and have
tender consciences, every small object affrights them, the very
inconsiderate reading of Scripture itself, and misinterpretation of some
places of it; as, <q>Many are called, few are chosen. Not every one that
saith Lord. Fear not little flock. He that stands, let him take heed lest
he fall. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, That night two
shall be in a bed, one received, the other left. Strait is the way that
leads to heaven, and few there are that enter therein.</q> The parable of the
seed and of the sower, <q>some fell on barren ground, some was choked. Whom
he hath predestinated he hath chosen. He will have mercy on whom he will
have mercy.</q> <span lang="la">Non est volentis nec currentis, sed miserentis Dei.</span> These
and the like places terrify the souls of many; election, predestination,
reprobation, preposterously conceived, offend divers, with a deal of
foolish presumption, curiosity, needless speculation, contemplation,
solicitude, wherein they trouble and puzzle themselves about those
questions of grace, free will, perseverance, God's secrets; they will know
more than is revealed of God in his word, human capacity, or ignorance can
apprehend, and too importunate inquiry after that which is revealed;
mysteries, ceremonies, observation of Sabbaths, laws, duties, &amp;c., with
many such which the casuists discuss, and schoolmen broach, which divers
mistake, misconstrue, misapply to themselves, to their own undoing, and so
fall into this gulf. <q>They doubt of their election, how they shall know,
it, by what signs. And so far forth,</q> saith Luther, <q>with such nice points,
torture and crucify themselves, that they are almost mad, and all they get
by it is this, they lay open a gap to the devil by desperation to carry
them to hell;</q> but the greatest harm of all proceeds from those thundering
ministers, a most frequent cause they are of this malady: <a href="#note6710">[6710]</a><q>and do more
harm in the church</q> (saith Erasmus) <q>than they that flatter; great danger on
both sides, the one lulls them asleep in carnal security, the other drives
them to despair.</q> Whereas, <a href="#note6711">[6711]</a>St. Bernard well adviseth, <q>We should not
meddle with the one without the other, nor speak of judgment without mercy;
the one alone brings desperation, the other security.</q> But these men are
wholly for judgment; of a rigid disposition themselves, there is no mercy
with them, no salvation, no balsam for their diseased souls, they can speak
of nothing but reprobation, hell-fire, and damnation; as they did <span class="bibcite">Luke xi.
46.</span> lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, which they themselves touch
not with a finger. 'Tis familiar with our papists to terrify men's souls
with purgatory, tales, visions, apparitions, to daunt even the most
generous spirits, <q>to <a href="#note6712">[6712]</a>require charity,</q> as Brentius observes, <q>of
others, bounty, meekness, love, patience, when they themselves breathe
nought but lust, envy, covetousness.</q> They teach others to fast, give alms,
do penance, and crucify their mind with superstitious observations, bread
and water, hair clothes, whips, and the like, when they themselves have all
the dainties the world can afford, lie on a down-bed with a courtesan in
their arms: <span lang="la">Heu quantum patimur pro Christo</span>, as <a href="#note6713">[6713]</a>he said, what a
cruel tyranny is this, so to insult over and terrify men's souls! Our
indiscreet pastors many of them come not far behind, whilst in their
ordinary sermons they speak so much of election, predestination,
reprobation, <span lang="la">ab aeterno</span>, subtraction of grace, preterition, voluntary
permission, &amp;c., by what signs and tokens they shall discern and try
themselves, whether they be God's true children elect, <span lang="la">an sint reprobi,
praedestinati</span>, &amp;c., with such scrupulous points, they still aggravate sin,
thunder out God's judgments without respect, intempestively rail at and
pronounce them damned in all auditories, for giving so much to sports and
honest recreations, making every small fault and thing indifferent an
irremissible offence, they so rent, tear and wound men's consciences, that
they are almost mad, and at their wits' end.

<p><q>These bitter potions</q> (saith <a href="#note6714">[6714]</a>Erasmus) <q>are still in their mouths,
nothing but gall and horror, and a mad noise, they make all their auditors
desperate:</q> many are wounded by this means, and they commonly that are most
devout and precise, have been formerly presumptuous, and certain of their
salvation; they that have tender consciences, that follow sermons, frequent
lectures, that have indeed least cause, they are most apt to mistake, and
fall into these miseries. I have heard some complain of Parson's
Resolution, and other books of like nature (good otherwise), they are too
tragical, too much dejecting men, aggravating offences: great care and
choice, much discretion is required in this kind.

<p>The last and greatest cause of this malady, is our own conscience, sense of
our sins, and God's anger justly deserved, a guilty conscience for some
foul offence formerly committed,&mdash;<a href="#note6715">[6715]</a>O <span lang="la">miser Oreste, quid morbi te
perdit</span>? Or: <span lang="la">Conscientia, Sum enim mihi conscius de malis perpetratis</span>.<a href="#note6716">[6716]</a>
<q>A good conscience is a continual feast,</q> but a galled conscience is as
great a torment as can possibly happen, a still baking oven, (so Pierius in
his Hieroglyph, compares it) another hell. Our conscience, which is a great
ledger book, wherein are written all our offences, a register to lay them
up, (which those <a href="#note6717">[6717]</a>Egyptians in their hieroglyphics expressed by a mill,
as well for the continuance, as for the torture of it) grinds our souls
with the remembrance of some precedent sins, makes us reflect upon, accuse
and condemn our own selves. <a href="#note6718">[6718]</a><q>Sin lies at door,</q> &amp;c. I know there be many
other causes assigned by Zanchius, <a href="#note6719">[6719]</a>Musculus, and the rest; as
incredulity, infidelity, presumption, ignorance, blindness, ingratitude,
discontent, those five grand miseries in Aristotle, ignominy, need,
sickness, enmity, death, &amp;c.; but this of conscience is the greatest,
<a href="#note6720">[6720]</a><span lang="la">Instar ulceris corpus jugiter percellens</span>: The scrupulous conscience
(as <a href="#note6721">[6721]</a>Peter Forestus calls it) which tortures so many, that either out of
a deep apprehension of their unworthiness, and consideration of their own
dissolute life, <q>accuse themselves and aggravate every small offence, when
there is no such cause, misdoubting in the meantime God's mercies, they
fall into these inconveniences.</q> The poet calls them <a href="#note6722">[6722]</a>furies dire, but it
is the conscience alone which is a thousand witnesses to accuse us, <a href="#note6723">[6723]</a>
<span lang="la">Nocte dieque suum gestant in pectore testem</span>. A continual tester to give
in evidence, to empanel a jury to examine us, to cry guilty, a persecutor
with hue and cry to follow, an apparitor to summon us, a bailiff to carry
us, a serjeant to arrest, an attorney to plead against us, a gaoler to
torment, a judge to condemn, still accusing, denouncing, torturing and
molesting. And as the statue of Juno in that holy city near Euphrates in
<a href="#note6724">[6724]</a>Assyria will look still towards you, sit where you will in her temple,
she stares full upon you, if you go by, she follows with her eye, in all
sites, places, conventicles, actions, our conscience will be still ready to
accuse us. After many pleasant days, and fortunate adventures, merry tides,
this conscience at last doth arrest us. Well he may escape temporal
punishment, <a href="#note6725">[6725]</a>bribe a corrupt judge, and avoid the censure of law, and
flourish for a time; <q>for <a href="#note6726">[6726]</a>who ever saw</q> (saith Chrysostom) <q>a covetous
man troubled in mind when he is telling of his money, an adulterer mourn
with his mistress in his arms? we are then drunk with pleasure, and
perceive nothing:</q> yet as the prodigal son had dainty fare, sweet music at
first, merry company, jovial entertainment, but a cruel reckoning in the
end, as bitter as wormwood, a fearful visitation commonly follows. And the
devil that then told thee that it was a light sin, or no sin at all, now
aggravates on the other side, and telleth thee, that it is a most
irremissible offence, as he did by Cain and Judas, to bring them to
despair; every small circumstance before neglected and contemned, will now
amplify itself, rise up in judgment, and accuse the dust of their shoes,
dumb creatures, as to Lucian's tyrant, <span lang="la">lectus et candela</span>, the bed and
candle did bear witness, to torment their souls for their sins past.
Tragical examples in this kind are too familiar and common: Adrian, Galba,
Nero, Otho, Vitellius, Caracalla, were in such horror of conscience for
their offences committed, murders, rapes, extortions, injuries, that they
were weary of their lives, and could get nobody to kill them. <a href="#note6727">[6727]</a>Kennetus,
King of Scotland, when he had murdered his nephew Malcom, King Duffe's son,
Prince of Cumberland, and with counterfeit tears and protestations
dissembled the matter a long time, <a href="#note6728">[6728]</a><q>at last his conscience accused
him, his unquiet soul could not rest day or night, he was terrified with
fearful dreams, visions, and so miserably tormented all his life.</q> It is
strange to read what <a href="#note6729">[6729]</a>Cominaeus hath written of Louis XI. that French
King; of Charles VIII.; of Alphonsus, King of Naples; in the fury of his
passion how he came into Sicily, and what pranks he played. Guicciardini, a
man most unapt to believe lies, relates how that Ferdinand his father's
ghost who before had died for grief, came and told him, that he could not
resist the French King, he thought every man cried France, France; the
reason of it (saith Cominseus) was because he was a vile tyrant, a
murderer, an oppressor of his subjects, he bought up all commodities, and
sold them at his own price, sold abbeys to Jews and Falkoners; both
Ferdinand his father, and he himself never made conscience of any committed
sin; and to conclude, saith he, it was impossible to do worse than they
did. Why was Pausanias the Spartan tyrant, Nero, Otho, Galba, so persecuted
with spirits in every house they came, but for their murders which they had
committed? <a href="#note6730">[6730]</a>Why doth the devil haunt many men's houses after their
deaths, appear to them living, and take possession of their habitations, as
it were, of their palaces, but because of their several villainies? Why had
Richard the Third such fearful dreams, saith Polydore, but for his frequent
murders? Why was Herod so tortured in his mind? because he had made away
Mariamne his wife. Why was Theodoric, the King of the Goths, so suspicious,
and so affrighted with a fish head alone, but that he had murdered
Symmachus, and Boethius his son-in-law, those worthy Romans? Caelius, <span class="cite">lib.
27. cap. 22.</span> See more in Plutarch, in his tract <span lang="la">De his qui sero a Numine
puniuntur</span>, and in his book <span class="cite">De tranquillitate animi</span>, &amp;c. Yea, and
sometimes GOD himself hath a hand in it, to show his power, humiliate,
exercise, and to try their faith, (divine temptation, Perkins calls it,
<span class="cite">Cas. cons. lib. 1. cap. 8. sect. 1.</span>) to punish them for their sins.
God the avenger, as <a href="#note6731">[6731]</a>David terms him, <span lang="la">ultor a tergo Deus</span>, his wrath
is apprehended of a guilty, soul, as by Saul and Judas, which the poets
expressed by Adrastia, or Nemesis:
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6732">[6732]</a>Assequitur Nemesique virum vestigia servat,</div>
<div class="line">Ne male quid facias.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
</div>
And she is, as <a href="#note6733">[6733]</a>Ammianus, <span class="cite">lib. 14.</span> describes her, <q>the queen of
causes, and moderator of things,</q> now she pulls down the proud, now she
rears and encourageth those that are good; he gives instance in his
Eusebius; Nicephorus, <span class="cite">lib. 10. cap. 35. eccles. hist.</span> in Maximinus and
Julian. Fearful examples of God's just judgment, wrath and vengeance, are
to be found in all histories, of some that have been eaten to death with
rats and mice, as <a href="#note6734">[6734]</a>Popelius, the second King of Poland, ann. 830, his
wife and children; the like story is of Hatto, Archbishop of Mentz, ann.
969, so devoured by these vermin, which howsoever Serrarius the Jesuit
Mogunt. <span class="cite">rerum lib. 4. cap. 5.</span> impugn by twenty-two arguments, Tritemius,
<a href="#note6735">[6735]</a>Munster, Magdeburgenses, and many others relate for a truth. Such
another example I find in Geraldus Cambrensis <span class="cite">Itin. Cam. lib. 2. cap. 2.</span>
and where not?

<p>And yet for all these terrors of conscience, affrighting punishments which
are so frequent, or whatsoever else may cause or aggravate this fearful
malady in other religions, I see no reason at all why a papist at any time
should despair, or be troubled for his sins; for let him be never so
dissolute a caitiff so notorious a villain, so monstrous a sinner, out of
that treasure of indulgences and merits of which the pope is dispensator,
he may have free pardon and plenary remission of all his sins. There be so
many general pardons for ages to come, forty thousand years to come, so
many jubilees, so frequent gaol-deliveries out of purgatory for all souls,
now living, or after dissolution of the body, so many particular masses
daily said in several churches, so many altars consecrated to this purpose,
that if a man have either money or friends, or will take any pains to come
to such an altar, hear a mass, say so many paternosters, undergo such and
such penance, he cannot do amiss, it is impossible his mind should be
troubled, or he have any scruple to molest him. Besides that <span lang="la">Taxa Camerae
Apostolicae</span>, which was first published to get money in the days of Leo
Decimus, that sharking pope, and since divulged to the same ends, sets down
such easy rates and dispensations for all offences, for perjury, murder,
incest, adultery, &amp;c., for so many grosses or dollars (able to invite any
man to sin, and provoke him to offend, methinks, that otherwise would not)
such comfortable remission, so gentle and parable a pardon, so ready at
hand, with so small cost and suit obtained, that I cannot see how he that
hath any friends amongst them (as I say) or money in his purse, or will at
least to ease himself, can any way miscarry or be misaffected, how he
should be desperate, in danger of damnation, or troubled in mind. Their
ghostly fathers can so readily apply remedies, so cunningly string and
unstring, wind and unwind their devotions, play upon their consciences with
plausible speeches and terrible threats, for their best advantage settle
and remove, erect with such facility and deject, let in and out, that I
cannot perceive how any man amongst them should much or often labour of
this disease, or finally miscarry. The causes above named must more
frequently therefore take hold in others.

<h4><a name="3.4.2.4"></a>SUBSECT. IV.&mdash;<i>Symptoms of Despair, Fear, Sorrow, Suspicion, Anxiety, Horror of Conscience, Fearful Dreams and Visions</i>.</h4>

<p>As shoemakers do when they bring home shoes, still cry leather is dearer
and dearer, may I justly say of those melancholy symptoms: these of despair
are most violent, tragical, and grievous, far beyond the rest, not to be
expressed but negatively, as it is privation of all happiness, not to be
endured; <q>for a wounded spirit who can bear it?</q> <span class="bibcite">Prov. xviii. 19.</span> What,
therefore, <a href="#note6736">[6736]</a>Timanthes did in his picture of Iphigenia, now ready to be
sacrificed, when he had painted Chalcas mourning, Ulysses sad, but most
sorrowful Menelaus; and showed all his art in expressing a variety of
affections, he covered the maid's father Agamemnon's head with a veil, and
left it to every spectator to conceive what he would himself; for that true
passion and sorrow in <span lang="la">summo gradu</span>, such as his was, could not by any art
be deciphered. What he did in his picture, I will do in describing the
symptoms of despair; imagine what thou canst, fear, sorrow, furies, grief,
pain, terror, anger, dismal, ghastly, tedious, irksome, &amp;c. it is not
sufficient, it comes far short, no tongue can tell, no heart conceive it.
'Tis an epitome of hell, an extract, a quintessence, a compound, a mixture
of all feral maladies, tyrannical tortures, plagues, and perplexities.
There is no sickness almost but physic provideth a remedy for it; to every
sore chirurgery will provide a slave; friendship helps poverty; hope of
liberty easeth imprisonment; suit and favour revoke banishment; authority
and time wear away reproach: but what physic, what chirurgery, what wealth,
favour, authority can relieve, bear out, assuage, or expel a troubled
conscience? A quiet mind cureth all them, but all they cannot comfort a
distressed soul: who can put to silence the voice of desperation? All that
is single in other melancholy, <span lang="la">Horribile, dirum, pestilens, atrox, ferum</span>,
concur in this, it is more than melancholy in the highest degree; a burning
fever of the soul; so mad, saith <a href="#note6737">[6737]</a>Jacchinus, by this misery; fear,
sorrow, and despair, he puts for ordinary symptoms of melancholy. They are
in great pain and horror of mind, distraction of soul, restless, full of
continual fears, cares, torments, anxieties, they can neither eat, drink,
nor sleep for them, take no rest,
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6738">[6738]</a>Perpetua impietas, nec mensae tempore cessat,</div>
<div class="line">Exagitat vesana quies, somnique furentes.</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="line">Neither at bed, nor yet at board,</div>
<div class="line">Will any rest despair afford.</div>
</div>
Fear takes away their content, and dries the blood, wasteth the marrow,
alters their countenance, <q>even in their greatest delights, singing,
dancing, dalliance, they are still</q> (saith <a href="#note6739">[6739]</a>Lemnius) <q>tortured in their
souls.</q> It consumes them to nought, <q>I am like a pelican in the wilderness
(saith David of himself, temporally afflicted), an owl, because of thine
indignation,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psalm cii. 8, 10</span>, and <span class="bibcite">Psalm lv. 4.</span> <q>My heart trembleth within
me, and the terrors of death have come upon me; fear and trembling are come
upon me, &amp;c. at death's door,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psalm cvii. 18.</span> <q>Their soul abhors all
manner of meats.</q> Their <a href="#note6740">[6740]</a>sleep is (if it be any) unquiet, subject to
fearful dreams and terrors. Peter in his bonds slept secure, for he knew
God protected him; and Tully makes it an argument of Roscius Amerinus'
innocency, that he killed not his father, because he so securely slept.
Those martyrs in the primitive church were most <a href="#note6741">[6741]</a>cheerful and merry in
the midst of their persecutions; but it is far otherwise with these men,
tossed in a sea, and that continually without rest or intermission, they
can think of nought that is pleasant, <a href="#note6742">[6742]</a><q>their conscience will not let
them be quiet,</q> in perpetual fear, anxiety, if they be not yet apprehended,
they are in doubt still they shall be ready to betray themselves, as Cain
did, he thinks every man will kill him; <q>and roar for the grief of heart,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Psalm xxxviii. 8</span>, as David did; as Job did, <span class="bibcite">xx. 3, 21, 22</span>, &amp;c., <q>Wherefore
is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that have heavy
hearts? which long for death, and if it come not, search it more than
treasures, and rejoice when they can find the grave.</q> They are generally
weary of their lives, a trembling heart they have, a sorrowful mind, and
little or no rest. <span lang="la">Terror ubique tremor, timor undique et undique terror.</span>
<q>Fears, terrors, and affrights in all places, at all times and seasons.</q>
<span lang="la">Cibum et potum pertinaciter aversantur multi, nodum in scirpo quaeritantes,
et culpam imaginantes ubi nulla est</span>, as Wierus writes <span class="cite">de Lamiis lib. 3.
c. 7.</span> <q>they refuse many of them meat and drink, cannot rest, aggravating
still and supposing grievous offences where there are none.</q> God's heavy
wrath is kindled in their souls, and notwithstanding their continual
prayers and supplications to Christ Jesus, they have no release or ease at
all, but a most intolerable torment, and insufferable anguish of
conscience, and that makes them, through impatience, to murmur against God
many times, to rave, to blaspheme, turn atheists, and seek to offer
violence to themselves. <span class="bibcite">Deut. xxviii. 65, 68.</span> <q>In the morning they wish for
evening, and for morning in the evening, for the sight of their eyes which
they see, and fear of hearts.</q> <a href="#note6743">[6743]</a>Marinus Mercennus, in his comment on
Genesis, makes mention of a desperate friend of his, whom, amongst others,
he came to visit, and exhort to patience, that broke out into most
blasphemous atheistical speeches, too fearful to relate, when they wished
him to trust in God, <span lang="la">Quis est ille Deus (inquit) ut serviam illi, quid
proderit si oraverim; si praesens est, cur non succurrit? cur non me
carcere, inertia, squalore confectum liberat? quid ego feci? &amp;c. absit a me
hujusmodi Deus</span>. Another of his acquaintance broke out into like
atheistical blasphemies, upon his wife's death raved, cursed, said and did
he cared not what. And so for the most part it is with them all, many of
them, in their extremity, think they hear and see visions, outcries, confer
with devils, that they are tormented, possessed, and in hell-fire, already
damned, quite forsaken of God, they have no sense or feeling of mercy, or
grace, hope of salvation, their sentence of condemnation is already past,
and not to be revoked, the devil will certainly have them. Never was any
living creature in such torment before, in such a miserable estate, in such
distress of mind, no hope, no faith, past cure, reprobate, continually
tempted to make away themselves. Something talks with them, they spit fire
and brimstone, they cannot but blaspheme, they cannot repent, believe or
think a good thought, so far carried; <span lang="la">ut cogantur ad impia cogitandum
etiam contra voluntatem</span>, said <a href="#note6744">[6744]</a>Felix Plater, <span lang="la">ad blasphemiam erga
deum, ad multa horrenda perpetranda, ad manus violentas sibi inferendas</span>,
&amp;c., and in their distracted fits and desperate humours, to offer violence
to others, their familiar and dear friends sometimes, or to mere strangers,
upon very small or no occasion; for he that cares not for his own, is
master of another man's life. They think evil against their wills; that
which they abhor themselves, they must needs think, do, and speak. He gives
instance in a patient of his, that when he would pray, had such evil
thoughts still suggested to him, and wicked <a href="#note6745">[6745]</a>meditations. Another
instance he hath of a woman that was often tempted to curse God, to
blaspheme and kill herself. Sometimes the devil (as they say) stands
without and talks with them, sometimes he is within them, as they think,
and there speaks and talks as to such as are possessed: so Apollodorus, in
Plutarch, thought his heart spake within him. There is a most memorable
example of <a href="#note6746">[6746]</a>Francis Spira, an advocate of Padua, Ann. 1545, that being
desperate, by no counsel of learned men could be comforted: he felt (as he
said) the pains of hell in his soul; in all other things he discoursed
aright, but in this most mad. Frismelica, Bullovat, and some other
excellent physicians, could neither make him eat, drink, or sleep, no
persuasion could ease him. Never pleaded any man so well for himself, as
this man did against himself, and so he desperately died. Springer, a
lawyer, hath written his life. Cardinal Crescence died so likewise
desperate at Verona, still he thought a black dog followed him to his
death-bed, no man could drive the dog away, Sleiden. <span class="cite">com. 23. cap. lib.
3.</span> Whilst I was writing this Treatise, saith Montaltus, <span class="cite">cap. 2. de mel.</span>
<a href="#note6747">[6747]</a><q>A nun came to me for help, well for all other matters, but troubled
in conscience for five years last past; she is almost mad, and not able to
resist, thinks she hath offended God, and is certainly damned.</q> Felix
Plater hath store of instances of such as thought themselves damned, <a href="#note6748">[6748]</a>
forsaken of God, &amp;c. One amongst the rest, that durst not go to church, or
come near the Rhine, for fear to make away himself, because then he was
most especially tempted. These and such like symptoms are intended and
remitted, as the malady itself is more or less; some will hear good
counsel, some will not; some desire help, some reject all, and will not be
eased.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.4.2.5"></a>SUBSECT. V.&mdash;<i>Prognostics of Despair, Atheism, Blasphemy, violent death, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Most part these kind of persons make <a href="#note6749">[6749]</a>away themselves, some are mad,
blaspheme, curse, deny God, but most offer violence to their own persons,
and sometimes to others. <q>A wounded spirit who can bear?</q> <span class="bibcite">Prov. xviii. 14.</span>
As Cain, Saul, Achitophel, Judas, blasphemed and died. Bede saith, Pilate
died desperate eight years after Christ. <a href="#note6750">[6750]</a>Felix Plater hath collected
many examples. <a href="#note6751">[6751]</a>A merchant's wife that was long troubled with such
temptations, in the night rose from her bed, and out of the window broke
her neck into the street: another drowned himself desperate as he was in
the Rhine: some cut their throats, many hang themselves. But this needs no
illustration. It is controverted by some, whether a man so offering
violence to himself, dying desperate, may be saved, ay or no? If they die
so obstinately and suddenly, that they cannot so much as wish for mercy,
the worst is to be suspected, because they die impenitent. <a href="#note6752">[6752]</a>If their
death had been a little more lingering, wherein they might have some
leisure in their hearts to cry for mercy, charity may judge the best;
divers have been recovered out of the very act of hanging and drowning
themselves, and so brought <span lang="la">ad sanam mentem</span>, they have been very penitent,
much abhorred their former act, confessed that they have repented in an
instant, and cried for mercy in their hearts. If a man put desperate hands
upon himself, by occasion of madness or melancholy, if he have given
testimony before of his regeneration, in regard he doth this not so much
out of his will, as <span lang="la">ex vi morbi</span>, we must make the best construction of
it, as <a href="#note6753">[6753]</a>Turks do, that think all fools and madmen go directly to
heaven.
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h4><a name="3.4.2.6"></a>SUBSECT. VI.&mdash;<i>Cure of Despair by Physic, Good Counsel, Comforts, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Experience teacheth us, that though many die obstinate and wilful in this
malady, yet multitudes again are able to resist and overcome, seek for help
and find comfort, are taken <span lang="la">e faucibus Erebi</span>, from the chops of hell, and
out of the devil's paws, though they have by <a href="#note6754">[6754]</a>obligation, given
themselves to him. Some out of their own strength, and God's assistance,
<q>Though He kill me,</q> (saith Job,) <q>yet will I trust in Him,</q> out of good
counsel, advice and physic. <a href="#note6755">[6755]</a>Bellovacus cured a monk by altering his
habit, and course of life: Plater many by physic alone. But for the most
part they must concur; and they take a wrong course that think to overcome
this feral passion by sole physic; and they are as much out, that think to
work this effect by good service alone, though both be forcible in
themselves, yet <span lang="la">vis unita fortior</span>, <q>they must go hand in hand to this
disease:</q>&mdash;<span lang="la">alterius sic altera poscit opem.</span> For physic the like
course is to be taken with this as in other melancholy: diet, air,
exercise, all those passions and perturbations of the mind, &amp;c. are to be
rectified by the same means. They must not be left solitary, or to
themselves, never idle, never out of company. Counsel, good comfort is to
be applied, as they shall see the parties inclined, or to the causes,
whether it be loss, fear, be grief, discontent, or some such feral
accident, a guilty conscience, or otherwise by frequent meditation, too
grievous an apprehension, and consideration of his former life; by hearing,
reading of Scriptures, good divines, good advice and conference, applying
God's word to their distressed souls, it must be corrected and
counterpoised. Many excellent exhortations, phraenetical discourses, are
extant to this purpose, for such as are any way troubled in mind: Perkins,
Greenham, Hayward, Bright, Abernethy, Bolton, Culmannus, Helmingius,
Caelius Secundus, Nicholas Laurentius, are copious on this subject: Azorius,
Navarrus, Sayrus, &amp;c., and such as have written cases of conscience amongst
our pontifical writers. But because these men's works are not to all
parties at hand, so parable at all times, I will for the benefit and ease
of such as are afflicted, at the request of some <a href="#note6756">[6756]</a>friends, recollect
out of their voluminous treatises, some few such comfortable speeches,
exhortations, arguments, advice, tending to this subject, and out of God's
word, knowing, as Culmannus saith upon the like occasion, <a href="#note6757">[6757]</a><q>how
unavailable and vain men's councils are to comfort an afflicted conscience,
except God's word concur and be annexed, from which comes life, ease,
repentance,</q> &amp;c. Presupposing first that which Beza, Greenham, Perkins,
Bolton, give in charge, the parties to whom counsel is given be
sufficiently prepared, humbled for their sins, fit for comfort, confessed,
tried how they are more or less afflicted, how they stand affected, or
capable of good advice, before any remedies be applied: to such therefore
as are so thoroughly searched and examined, I address this following
discourse.

<p>Two main antidotes, <a href="#note6758">[6758]</a>Hemmingius observes, opposite to despair, good hope
out of God's word, to be embraced; perverse security and presumption from
the devil's treachery, to be rejected; <span lang="la">Illa solus animae, haec pestis</span>; one
saves, the other kills, <span lang="la">occidit animam</span>, saith Austin, and doth as much
harm as despair itself, <a href="#note6759">[6759]</a>Navarrus the casuist reckons up ten special
cures out of Anton. <span class="cite">1. part. Tit. 3. cap. 10.</span> 1. God. 2. Physic. 3.
<a href="#note6760">[6760]</a>Avoiding such objects as have caused it. 4. Submission of himself to
other men's judgments. 5. Answer of all objections, &amp;c. All which Cajetan,
Gerson, <span class="cite">lib. de vit. spirit.</span> Sayrus, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cons. cap. 14.</span> repeat
and approve out of Emanuel Roderiques, <span class="cite">cap. 51 et 52.</span> Greenham
prescribes six special rules, Culmannus seven. First, to acknowledge all
help come from God. 2. That the cause of their present misery is sin. 3. To
repent and be heartily sorry for their sins. 4. To pray earnestly to God
they may be eased. 5. To expect and implore the prayers of the church, and
good men's advice. 6. Physic. 7. To commend themselves to God, and rely
upon His mercy: others, otherwise, but all to this effect. But forasmuch as
most men in this malady are spiritually sick, void of reason almost,
overborne by their miseries, and too deep an apprehension of their sins,
they cannot apply themselves to good counsel, pray, believe, repent, we
must, as much as in us lies, occur and help their peculiar infirmities,
according to their several causes and symptoms, as we shall find them
distressed and complain.

<p>The main matter which terrifies and torments most that are troubled in
mind, is the enormity of their offences, the intolerable burthen of their
sins, God's heavy wrath and displeasure so deeply apprehended, that they
account themselves reprobates, quite forsaken of God, already damned, past
all hope of grace, incapable of mercy, <span lang="la">diaboli mancipia</span>, slaves of sin,
and their offences so great they cannot be forgiven. But these men must
know there is no sin so heinous which is not pardonable in itself, no crime
so great but by God's mercy it may be forgiven. <q>Where sin aboundeth, grace
aboundeth much more,</q> <span class="bibcite">Rom. v. 20.</span> And what the Lord said unto Paul in his
extremity, <span class="bibcite">2 Cor. xi. 9.</span> <q>My grace is sufficient for thee, for my power is
made perfect through weakness:</q> concerns every man in like case. His
promises are made indefinite to all believers, generally spoken to all
touching remission of sins that are truly penitent, grieved for their
offences, and desire to be reconciled, <span class="bibcite">Matt. ix. 12, 13</span>, <q>I came not to
call the righteous but sinners to repentance,</q> that is, such as are truly
touched in conscience for their sins. Again, <span class="bibcite">Matt. xi. 28</span>, <q>Come unto me
all ye that are heavy laden, and I will ease you.</q> <span class="bibcite">Ezek. xviii. 27</span>, <q>At
what time soever a sinner shall repent him of his sins from the bottom of
his heart, I will blot out all his wickedness out of my remembrance saith
the Lord.</q> <span class="bibcite">Isaiah xliii. 25</span>, <q>I, even I, am He that put away thine iniquity
for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</q> <q>As a father</q> (saith
David <span class="bibcite">Psal. ciii. 13</span>) <q>hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord
compassion on them that fear him.</q> And will receive them again as the
prodigal son was entertained, Luke xv., if they shall so come with tears in
their eyes, and a penitent heart. <span lang="la">Peccator agnoscat, Deus ignoscit.</span> <q>The
Lord is full of compassion and mercy, slow to anger, of great kindness,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Psal. ciii. 8.</span> <q>He will not always chide, neither keep His anger for ever,</q>
<span class="bibcite">9.</span> <q>As high as the heaven is above the earth, so great is His mercy towards
them that fear Him,</q> <span class="bibcite">11.</span> <q>As far as the East is from the West, so far hath
He removed our sins from us,</q> <span class="bibcite">12.</span> Though Cain cry out in the anguish of his
soul, my punishment is greater than I can bear, 'tis not so; thou liest,
Cain (saith Austin), <q>God's mercy is greater than thy sins. His mercy is
above all His works,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psal. cxlv. 9</span>, able to satisfy for all men's sins,
<span lang="la">antilutron</span>, <span class="bibcite">1 Tim. ii. 6.</span> His mercy is a panacea, a balsam for an
afflicted soul, a sovereign medicine, an alexipharmacum for all sins, a
charm for the devil; his mercy was great to Solomon, to Manasseh, to Peter,
great to all offenders, and whosoever thou art, it may be so to thee. For
why should God bid us pray (as Austin infers) <q>Deliver us from all evil,</q>
<span lang="la">nisi ipse misericors perseveraret</span>, if He did not intend to help us? He
therefore that <a href="#note6761">[6761]</a>doubts of the remission of his sins, denies God's
mercy, and doth Him injury, saith Austin. Yea, but thou repliest, I am a
notorious sinner, mine offences are not so great as infinite. Hear
Fulgentius, <a href="#note6762">[6762]</a><q>God's invincible goodness cannot be overcome by sin, His
infinite mercy cannot be terminated by any: the multitude of His mercy is
equivalent to His magnitude.</q> Hear <a href="#note6763">[6763]</a>Chrysostom, <q>Thy malice may be
measured, but God's mercy cannot be defined; thy malice is circumscribed,
His mercies infinite.</q> As a drop of water is to the sea, so are thy
misdeeds to His mercy: nay, there is no such proportion to be given; for
the sea, though great, yet may be measured, but God's mercy cannot be
circumscribed. Whatsoever thy sins be then in quantity or quality,
multitude or magnitude, fear them not, distrust not. I speak not this,
saith <a href="#note6764">[6764]</a>Chrysostom, <q>to make thee secure and negligent, but to cheer
thee up.</q> Yea but, thou urgest again, I have little comfort of this which
is said, it concerns me not: <span lang="la">Inanis poenitentia quam sequens culpa
coinquinat</span>, 'tis to no purpose for me to repent, and to do worse than ever
I did before, to persevere in sin, and to return to my lusts as a dog to
his vomit, or a swine to the mire: <a href="#note6765">[6765]</a>to what end is it to ask
forgiveness of my sins, and yet daily to sin again and again, to do evil
out of a habit? I daily and hourly offend in thought, word, and deed, in a
relapse by mine own weakness and wilfulness: my <span lang="la">bonus genius</span>, my good
protecting angel is gone, I am fallen from that I was or would be, worse
and worse, <q>my latter end is worse than my beginning:</q> <span lang="la">Si quotidiae peccas,
quotidie</span>, saith Chrysostom, <span lang="la">poenitentiam age</span>, if thou daily offend,
daily repent: <a href="#note6766">[6766]</a><q>if twice, thrice, a hundred, a hundred thousand times,
twice, thrice, a hundred thousand times repent.</q> As they do by an old house
that is out of repair, still mend some part or other; so do by thy soul,
still reform some vice, repair it by repentance, call to Him for grace, and
thou shalt have it; <q>For we are freely justified by His grace,</q> <span class="bibcite">Rom. iii.
24.</span> If thine enemy repent, as our Saviour enjoined Peter, forgive him
seventy-seven times; and why shouldst thou think God will not forgive thee?
Why should the enormity of thy sins trouble thee? God can do it, he will do
it. <q>My conscience</q> (saith <a href="#note6767">[6767]</a>Anselm) <q>dictates to me that I deserve
damnation, my repentance will not suffice for satisfaction: but thy mercy,
O Lord, quite overcometh all my transgressions.</q> The gods once (as the
poets feign) with a gold chain would pull Jupiter out of heaven, but all
they together could not stir him, and yet he could draw and turn them as he
would himself; maugre all the force and fury of these infernal fiends, and
crying sins, <q>His grace is sufficient.</q> Confer the debt and the payment;
Christ and Adam; sin, and the cure of it; the disease and the medicine;
confer the sick man to his physician, and thou shalt soon perceive that his
power is infinitely beyond it. God is better able, as <a href="#note6768">[6768]</a>Bernard
informeth us, <q>to help, than sin to do us hurt; Christ is better able to
save, than the devil to destroy.</q> <a href="#note6769">[6769]</a>If he be a skilful Physician, as
Fulgentius adds, <q>he can cure all diseases; if merciful, he will.</q> <span lang="la">Non est
perfecta bonitas a qua non omnis malitia vincitur</span>, His goodness is not
absolute and perfect, if it be not able to overcome all malice. Submit
thyself unto Him, as St. Austin adviseth, <a href="#note6770">[6770]</a><q>He knoweth best what he
doth; and be not so much pleased when he sustains thee, as patient when he
corrects thee; he is omnipotent, and can cure all diseases when he sees his
own time.</q> He looks down from heaven upon earth, that he may hear the
<q>mourning of prisoners, and deliver the children of death,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psal. cii. 19.
20.</span> <q>And though our sins be as red as scarlet, He can make them as white as
snow,</q> <span class="bibcite">Isai. i. 18.</span> Doubt not of this, or ask how it shall be done: He is
all-sufficient that promiseth; <span lang="la">qui fecit mundum de immundo</span>, saith
Chrysostom, he that made a fair world of nought, can do this and much more
for his part: do thou only believe, trust in him, rely on him, be penitent
and heartily sorry for thy sins. Repentance is a sovereign remedy for all
sins, a spiritual wing to rear us, a charm for our miseries, a protecting
amulet to expel sin's venom, an attractive loadstone to draw God's mercy
and graces unto us. <a href="#note6771">[6771]</a><span lang="la">Peccatum vulnus, poenitentia medicinam</span>: sin made
the breach, repentance must help it; howsoever thine offence came, by
error, sloth, obstinacy, ignorance, <span lang="la">exitur per poenitentiam</span>, this is the
sole means to be relieved. <a href="#note6772">[6772]</a>Hence comes our hope of safety, by this
alone sinners are saved, God is provoked to mercy. <q>This unlooseth all that
is bound, enlighteneth darkness, mends that is broken, puts life to that
which was desperately dying:</q> makes no respect of offences, or of persons.
<a href="#note6773">[6773]</a><q>This doth not repel a fornicator, reject a drunkard, resist a proud
fellow, turn away an idolater, but entertains all, communicates itself to
all.</q> Who persecuted the church more than Paul, offended more than Peter?
and yet by repentance (saith Curysologus) they got both <span lang="la">Magisterium et
ministerium sanctitatis</span>, the Magistery of holiness. The prodigal son went
far, but by repentance he came home at last. <a href="#note6774">[6774]</a><q>This alone will turn a
wolf into a sheep, make a publican a preacher, turn a thorn into an olive,
make a debauched fellow religious,</q> a blasphemer sing halleluja, make
Alexander the coppersmith truly devout, make a devil a saint. <a href="#note6775">[6775]</a><q>And him
that polluted his mouth with calumnies, lying, swearing, and filthy tunes
and tones, to purge his throat with divine Psalms.</q> Repentance will effect
prodigious cures, make a stupend metamorphosis. <q>A hawk came into the ark,
and went out again a hawk; a lion came in, went out a lion; a bear, a bear;
a wolf, a wolf; but if a hawk came into this sacred temple of repentance,
he will go forth a dove</q> (saith <a href="#note6776">[6776]</a>Chrysostom), <q>a wolf go out a sheep, a
lion a lamb. <a href="#note6777">[6777]</a>This gives sight to the blind, legs to the lame, cures
all diseases, confers grace, expels vice, inserts virtue, comforts and
fortifies the soul.</q> Shall I say, let thy sin be what it will, do but
repent, it is sufficient. <a href="#note6778">[6778]</a><span lang="la">Quem poenitet peccasse pene est innocens.</span>
'Tis true indeed and all-sufficient this, they do confess, if they could
repent; but they are obdurate, they have cauterised consciences, they are
in a reprobate sense, they cannot think a good thought, they cannot hope
for grace, pray, believe, repent, or be sorry for their sins, they find no
grief for sin in themselves, but rather a delight, no groaning of spirit,
but are carried headlong to their own destruction, <q>heaping wrath to
themselves against the day of wrath,</q> <span class="bibcite">Rom. ii. 5.</span> 'Tis a grievous case this
I do yield, and yet not to be despaired; God of his bounty and mercy calls
all to repentance, <span class="bibcite">Rom. ii. 4</span>, thou mayst be called at length, restored,
taken to His grace, as the thief upon the cross, at the last hour, as Mary
Magdalene and many other sinners have been, that were buried in sin. <q>God</q>
(saith <a href="#note6779">[6779]</a>Fulgentius) <q>is delighted in the conversion of a sinner, he sets
no time;</q> <span lang="la">prolixitas temporis Deo non praejudicat, aut gravitas peccati</span>,
deferring of time or grievousness of sin, do not prejudicate his grace,
things past and to come are all one to Him, as present: 'tis never too late
to repent. <a href="#note6780">[6780]</a><q>This heaven of repentance is still open for all distressed
souls;</q> and howsoever as yet no signs appear, thou mayst repent in good
time. Hear a comfortable speech of St. Austin, <a href="#note6781">[6781]</a><q>Whatsoever thou shall
do, how great a sinner soever, thou art yet living; if God would not help
thee, he would surely take thee away; but in sparing thy life, he gives
thee leisure, and invites thee to repentance.</q> Howsoever as yet, I say,
thou perceivest no fruit, no feeling, findest no likelihood of it in
thyself, patiently abide the Lord's good leisure, despair not, or think
thou art a reprobate; He came to call sinners to repentance, <span class="bibcite">Luke v. 32</span>, of
which number thou art one; He came to call thee, and in his time will
surely call thee. And although as yet thou hast no inclination to pray, to
repent, thy faith be cold and dead, and thou wholly averse from all Divine
functions, yet it may revive, as trees are dead in winter, but flourish in
the spring! these virtues may lie hid in thee for the present, yet
hereafter show themselves, and peradventure already bud, howsoever thou
dost not perceive. 'Tis Satan's policy to plead against, suppress and
aggravate, to conceal those sparks of faith in thee. Thou dost not believe,
thou sayest, yet thou wouldst believe if thou couldst, 'tis thy desire to
believe; then pray, <a href="#note6782">[6782]</a><q>Lord help mine unbelief:</q> and hereafter thou
shall certainly believe: <a href="#note6783">[6783]</a><span lang="la">Dabitur sitienti</span>, it shall be given to him
that thirsteth. Thou canst not yet repent, hereafter thou shall; a black
cloud of sin as yet obnubilates thy soul, terrifies thy conscience, but
this cloud may conceive a rainbow at the last, and be quite dissipated by
repentance. Be of good cheer; a child is rational in power, not in act; and
so art thou penitent in affection, though not yet in action. 'Tis thy
desire to please God, to be heartily sorry; comfort thyself, no time is
overpast, 'tis never too late. A desire to repent is repentance itself,
though not in nature, yet in God's acceptance; a willing mind is
sufficient. <q>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Matt. v. 6.</span> He that is destitute of God's grace, and wisheth for it, shall
have it. <q>The Lord</q> (saith David, <span class="bibcite">Psal. x. 17</span>) <q>will hear the desire of the
poor,</q> that is, such as are in distress of body and mind. 'Tis true thou
canst not as yet grieve for thy sin, thou hast no feeling of faith, I
yield; yet canst thou grieve thou dost not grieve? It troubles thee, I am
sure, thine heart should be so impenitent and hard, thou wouldst have it
otherwise; 'tis thy desire to grieve, to repent, and to believe. Thou
lovest God's children and saints in the meantime, hatest them not,
persecutest them not, but rather wishest thyself a true professor, to be as
they are, as thou thyself hast been heretofore; which is an evident token
thou art in no such desperate case. 'Tis a good sign of thy conversion, thy
sins are pardonable, thou art, or shalt surely be reconciled. <q>The Lord is
near them that are of a contrite heart,</q> <span class="bibcite">Luke iv. 18.</span> <a href="#note6784">[6784]</a>A true desire of
mercy in the want of mercy, is mercy itself; a desire of grace in the want
of grace, is grace itself; a constant and earnest desire to believe,
repent, and to be reconciled to God, if it be in a touched heart, is an
acceptation of God, a reconciliation, faith and repentance itself. For it
is not thy faith and repentance, as <a href="#note6785">[6785]</a>Chrysostom truly teacheth, that is
available, but God's mercy that is annexed to it, He accepts the will for
the deed: so that I conclude, to feel in ourselves the want of grace, and
to be grieved for it, is grace itself. I am troubled with fear my sins are
not forgiven, Careless objects: but Bradford answers they are; <q>For God
hath given thee a penitent and believing heart, that is, a heart which
desireth to repent and believe; for such an one is taken of him (he
accepting the will for the deed) for a truly penitent and believing heart.</q>

<p>All this is true thou repliest, but yet it concerns not thee, 'tis verified
in ordinary offenders, in common sins, but thine are of a higher strain,
even against the Holy Ghost himself, irremissible sins, sins of the first
magnitude, written with a pen of iron, engraven with a point of a diamond.
Thou art worse than a pagan, infidel, Jew, or Turk, for thou art an
apostate and more, thou hast voluntarily blasphemed, renounced God and all
religion, thou art worse than Judas himself, or they that crucified Christ:
for they did offend out of ignorance, but thou hast thought in thine heart
there is no God. Thou hast given thy soul to the devil, as witches and
conjurors do, <span lang="la">explicite</span> and <span lang="la">implicite</span>, by compact, band and obligation
(a desperate, a fearful case) to satisfy thy lust, or to be revenged of
thine enemies, thou didst never pray, come to church, hear, read, or do any
divine duties with any devotion, but for formality and fashion's sake, with
a kind of reluctance, 'twas troublesome and painful to thee to perform any
such thing, <span lang="la">praeter voluntatem</span>, against thy will. Thou never mad'st any
conscience of lying, swearing, bearing false witness, murder, adultery,
bribery, oppression, theft, drunkenness, idolatry, but hast ever done all
duties for fear of punishment, as they were most advantageous, and to thine
own ends, and committed all such notorious sins, with an extraordinary
delight, hating that thou shouldst love, and loving that thou shouldst
hate. Instead of faith, fear and love of God, repentance, &amp;c., blasphemous
thoughts have been ever harboured in his mind, even against God himself,
the blessed Trinity; the <a href="#note6786">[6786]</a>Scripture false, rude, harsh, immethodical:
heaven, hell, resurrection, mere toys and fables, <a href="#note6787">[6787]</a>incredible, impossible,
absurd, vain, ill contrived; religion, policy, and human invention, to keep
men in obedience, or for profit, invented by priests and lawgivers to that
purpose. If there be any such supreme power, he takes no notice of our
doings, hears not our prayers, regardeth them not, will not, cannot help,
or else he is partial, an excepter of persons, author of sin, a cruel, a
destructive God, to create our souls, and destinate them to eternal
damnation, to make us worse than our dogs and horses, why doth he not
govern things better, protect good men, root out wicked livers? why do they
prosper and flourish? as she raved in the <a href="#note6788">[6788]</a>tragedy&mdash;<span lang="la">pellices caelum
tenent</span>, there they shine, <span lang="la">Suasque Perseus aureas stellas habet</span>, where is
his providence? how appears it?
<div class="poem" lang="la">
<div class="line"><a href="#note6789">[6789]</a>Marmoreo Licinus tumulo jacet, at Cato parvo,</div>
<div class="line">Pomponius nullo, quis putet esse Deos.</div>
</div>
Why doth he suffer Turks to overcome Christians, the enemy to triumph over
his church, paganism to domineer in all places as it doth, heresies to
multiply, such enormities to be committed, and so many such bloody wars,
murders, massacres, plagues, feral diseases! why doth he not make us all
good, able, sound? why makes he <a href="#note6790">[6790]</a>venomous creatures, rocks, sands,
deserts, this earth itself the muck-hill of the world, a prison, a house of
correction? <a href="#note6791">[6791]</a><span lang="la">Mentimur regnare Jovem</span>, &amp;c., with many such horrible and
execrable conceits, not fit to be uttered; <span lang="la">Terribilia de fide, horribilia
de Divinitate.</span> They cannot some of them but think evil, they are compelled
<span lang="la">volentes nolentes</span>, to blaspheme, especially when they come to church and
pray, read, &amp;c., such foul and prodigious suggestions come into their
hearts.

<p>These are abominable, unspeakable offences, and most opposite to God,
<span lang="la">tentationes foedae, et impiae</span>, yet in this case, he or they that shall be
tempted and so affected, must know, that no man living is free from such
thoughts in part, or at some times, the most divine spirits have been so
tempted in some sort, evil custom, omission of holy exercises, ill company,
idleness, solitariness, melancholy, or depraved nature, and the devil is
still ready to corrupt, trouble, and divert our souls, to suggest such
blasphemous thoughts into our fantasies, ungodly, profane, monstrous and
wicked conceits: If they come from Satan, they are more speedy, fearful and
violent, the parties cannot avoid them: they are more frequent, I say, and
monstrous when they come; for the devil he is a spirit, and hath means and
opportunities to mingle himself with our spirits, and sometimes more slyly,
sometimes more abruptly and openly, to suggest such devilish thoughts into
our hearts; he insults and domineers in melancholy distempered fantasies
and persons especially; melancholy is <span lang="la">balneum, diaboli</span>, as Serapio holds,
the devil's bath, and invites him to come to it. As a sick man frets, raves
in his fits, speaks and doth he knows not what, the devil violently compels
such crazed souls to think such damned thoughts against their wills, they
cannot but do it; sometimes more continuate, or by fits, he takes his
advantage, as the subject is less able to resist, he aggravates,
extenuates, affirms, denies, damns, confounds the spirits, troubles heart,
brain, humours, organs, senses, and wholly domineers in their imaginations.
If they proceed from themselves, such thoughts, they are remiss and
moderate, not so violent and monstrous, not so frequent. The devil commonly
suggests things opposite to nature, opposite to God and his word, impious,
absurd, such as a man would never of himself, or could not conceive, they
strike terror and horror into the parties' own hearts. For if he or they be
asked whether they do approve of such like thoughts or no, they answer (and
their own souls truly dictate as much) they abhor them as much as hell and
the devil himself, they would fain think otherwise if they could; he hath
thought otherwise, and with all his soul desires so to think again; he doth
resist, and hath some good motions intermixed now and then: so that such
blasphemous, impious, unclean thoughts, are not his own, but the devil's;
they proceed not from him, but from a crazed phantasy, distempered humours,
black fumes which offend his brain: <a href="#note6792">[6792]</a>they are thy crosses, the devil's
sins, and he shall answer for them, he doth enforce thee to do that which
thou dost abhor, and didst never give consent to: and although he hath
sometimes so slyly set upon thee, and so far prevailed, as to make thee in
some sort to assent to such wicked thoughts, to delight in, yet they have
not proceeded from a confirmed will in thee, but are of that nature which
thou dost afterwards reject and abhor. Therefore be not overmuch troubled
and dismayed with such kind of suggestions, at least if they please thee
not, because they are not thy personal sins, for which thou shalt incur the
wrath of God, or his displeasure: contemn, neglect them, let them go as
they come, strive not too violently, or trouble thyself too much, but as
our Saviour said to Satan in like case, say thou, avoid Satan, I detest
thee and them. <span lang="la">Satanae est mala ingerere</span> (saith Austin) <span lang="la">nostrum non
consentire</span>: as Satan labours to suggest, so must we strive not to give
consent, and it will be sufficient: the more anxious and solicitous thou
art, the more perplexed, the more thou shalt otherwise be troubled and
entangled. Besides, they must know this, all so molested and distempered,
that although these be most execrable and grievous sins, they are
pardonable yet, through God's mercy and goodness, they may be forgiven, if
they be penitent and sorry for them. Paul himself confesseth, <span class="bibcite">Rom. xvii.
19.</span> <q>He did not the good he would do, but the evil which he would not do;
'tis not I, but sin that dwelleth in me.</q> 'Tis not thou, but Satan's
suggestions, his craft and subtlety, his malice: comfort thyself then if
thou be penitent and grieved, or desirous to be so, these heinous sins
shall not be laid to thy charge; God's mercy is above all sins, which if
thou do not finally contemn, without doubt thou shalt be saved. <a href="#note6793">[6793]</a><q>No
man sins against the Holy Ghost, but he that wilfully and finally
renounceth Christ, and contemneth him and his word to the last, without
which there is no salvation, from which grievous sin, God of his infinite
mercy deliver us.</q> Take hold of this to be thy comfort, and meditate withal
on God's word, labour to pray, to repent, to be renewed in mind, <q>keep
thine heart with all diligence.</q> <span class="bibcite">Prov. iv. 13</span>, resist the devil, and he
will fly from thee, pour out thy soul unto the Lord with sorrowful Hannah,
<q>pray continually,</q> as Paul enjoins, and as David did, <span class="bibcite">Psalm i.</span> <q>meditate
on his law day and night.</q>

<p>Yea, but this meditation is that mars all, and mistaken makes many men far
worse, misconceiving all they read or hear, to their own overthrow; the
more they search and read Scriptures, or divine treatises, the more they
puzzle themselves, as a bird in a net, the more they are entangled and
precipitated into this preposterous gulf: <q>Many are called, but few are
chosen,</q> <span class="bibcite">Matt. xx. 16.</span> and <span class="bibcite">xxii. 14.</span> with such like places of Scripture
misinterpreted strike them with horror, they doubt presently whether they
be of this number or no: God's eternal decree of predestination, absolute
reprobation, and such fatal tables, they form to their own ruin, and
impinge upon this rock of despair. How shall they be assured of their
salvation, by what signs? <q>If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall
the ungodly and sinners appear?</q> <span class="bibcite">1 Pet. iv. 18.</span> Who knows, saith Solomon,
whether he be elect? This grinds their souls, how shall they discern they
are not reprobates? But I say again, how shall they discern they are? From
the devil can be no certainty, for he is a liar from the beginning; if he
suggests any such thing, as too frequently he doth, reject him as a
deceiver, an enemy of human kind, dispute not with him, give no credit to
him, obstinately refuse him, as St. Anthony did in the wilderness, whom the
devil set upon in several shapes, or as the collier did, so do thou by him.
For when the devil tempted him with the weakness of his faith, and told him
he could not be saved, as being ignorant in the principles of religion, and
urged him moreover to know what he believed, what he thought of such and
such points and mysteries: the collier told him, he believed as the church
did; but what (said the devil again) doth the church believe? as I do (said
the collier); and what's that thou believest? as the church doth, &amp;c., when
the devil could get no other answer, he left him. If Satan summon thee to
answer, send him to Christ: he is thy liberty, thy protector against cruel
death, raging sin, that roaring lion, he is thy righteousness, thy Saviour,
and thy life. Though he say, thou art not of the number of the elect, a
reprobate, forsaken of God, hold thine own still, <span lang="la">hic murus aheneus esto</span>,
let this be as a bulwark, a brazen wall to defend thee, stay thyself in
that certainty of faith; let that be thy comfort, Christ will protect thee,
vindicate thee, thou art one of his flock, he will triumph over the law,
vanquish death, overcome the devil, and destroy hell. If he say thou art
none of the elect, no believer, reject him, defy him, thou hast thought
otherwise, and mayst so be resolved again; comfort thyself; this
persuasion cannot come from the devil, and much less can it be grounded
from thyself? men are liars, and why shouldst thou distrust? A denying
Peter, a persecuting Paul, an adulterous cruel David, have been received;
an apostate Solomon may be converted; no sin at all but impenitency, can
give testimony of final reprobation. Why shouldst thou then distrust,
misdoubt thyself, upon what ground, what suspicion? This opinion alone of
particularity? Against that, and for the certainty of election and
salvation on the other side, see God's good will toward men, hear how
generally his grace is proposed to him, and him, and them, each man in
particular, and to all. <span class="bibcite">1 Tim. ii. 4.</span> <q>God will that all men be saved, and
come to the knowledge of the truth.</q> 'Tis a universal promise, <q>God sent
not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that through him the
world might be saved.</q> <span class="bibcite">John iii. 17.</span> <q>He that acknowledged himself a man in
the world, must likewise acknowledge he is of that number that is to be
saved.</q> <span class="bibcite">Ezek. xxxiii. 11</span>, <q>I will not the death of a sinner, but that he
repent and live:</q> But thou art a sinner; therefore he will not thy death.
<q>This is the will of him that sent me, that every man that believeth in the
Son, should have everlasting life.</q> <span class="bibcite">John vi. 40.</span> <q>He would have no man
perish, but all come to repentance,</q> <span class="bibcite">2 Pet. iii. 9.</span> Besides, remission of
sins is to be preached, not to a few, but universally to all men, <q>Go
therefore and tell all nations, baptising them,</q> &amp;c. <span class="bibcite">Matt. xxviii. 19.</span> <q>Go
into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature,</q> <span class="bibcite">Mark xvi. 15.</span>
Now there cannot be contradictory wills in God, he will have all saved, and
not all, how can this stand together? be secure then, believe, trust in
him, hope well and be saved. Yea, that's the main matter, how shall I
believe or discern my security from carnal presumption? my faith is weak
and faint, I want those signs and fruits of sanctification, <a href="#note6794">[6794]</a>sorrow for
sin, thirsting for grace, groanings of the spirit, love of Christians as
Christians, avoiding occasion of sin, endeavour of new obedience, charity,
love of God, perseverance. Though these signs be languishing in thee, and
not seated in thine heart, thou must not therefore be dejected or
terrified; the effects of the faith and spirit are not yet so fully felt in
thee; conclude not therefore thou art a reprobate, or doubt of thine
election, because the elect themselves are without them, before their
conversion. Thou mayst in the Lord's good time be converted; some are
called at the eleventh hour. Use, I say, the means of thy conversion,
expect the Lord's leisure, if not yet called, pray thou mayst be, or at
least wish and desire thou. mayst be.

<p>Notwithstanding all this which might be said to this effect, to ease their
afflicted minds, what comfort our best divines can afford in this case,
Zanchius, Beza, &amp;c. This furious curiosity, needless speculation, fruitless
meditation about election, reprobation, free will, grace, such places of
Scripture preposterously conceived, torment still, and crucify the souls of
too many, and set all the world together by the ears. To avoid which
inconveniences, and to settle their distressed minds, to mitigate those
divine aphorisms, (though in another extreme some) our late Arminians have
revived that plausible doctrine of universal grace, which many fathers, our
late Lutheran and modern papists do still maintain, that we have free will
of ourselves, and that grace is common to all that will believe. Some
again, though less orthodoxal, will have a far greater part saved than
shall be damned, (as <a href="#note6795">[6795]</a>Caelius Secundus stiffly maintains in his book,
<span class="cite">De amplitudine regni coelestis</span>, or some impostor under his name)
<span lang="la">beatorum numerus multo major quam damnatorum.</span> <a href="#note6796">[6796]</a>He calls that other
tenet of special <a href="#note6797">[6797]</a><q>election and reprobation, a prejudicate, envious and
malicious opinion, apt to draw all men to desperation. Many are called, few
chosen,</q> &amp;c. He opposeth some opposite parts of Scripture to it, <q>Christ
came into the world to save sinners,</q> &amp;c. And four especial arguments he
produceth, one from God's power. If more be damned than saved, he
erroneously concludes, <a href="#note6798">[6798]</a>the devil hath the greater sovereignty! for
what is power but to protect? and majesty consists in multitude. <q>If the
devil have the greater part, where is his mercy, where is his power? how is
he <span lang="la">Deus Optimus Maximus, misericors</span>? &amp;c., where is his greatness, where
his goodness?</q> He proceeds, <a href="#note6799">[6799]</a><q>We account him a murderer that is
accessory only, or doth not help when he can; which may not be supposed of
God without great offence, because he may do what he will, and is otherwise
accessory, and the author of sin. The nature of good is to be communicated,
God is good, and will not then be contracted in his goodness: for how is he
the father of mercy and comfort, if his good concern but a few? O envious
and unthankful men to think otherwise! <a href="#note6800">[6800]</a>Why should we pray to God that
are Gentiles, and thank him for his mercies and benefits, that hath damned
us all innocuous for Adam's offence, one man's offence, one small offence,
eating of an apple? why should we acknowledge him for our governor that
hath wholly neglected the salvation of our souls, contemned us, and sent no
prophets or instructors to teach us, as he hath done to the Hebrews?</q> So
Julian the apostate objects. Why should these Christians (Caelius urgeth)
reject us and appropriate God unto themselves, <span lang="la">Deum illum suum unicum</span>,
&amp;c. But to return to our forged Caelius. At last he comes to that, he will
have those saved that never heard of, or believed in Christ, <span lang="la">ex puris
naturalibus</span>, with the Pelagians, and proves it out of Origen and others.
<q>They</q> (saith <a href="#note6801">[6801]</a>Origen) <q>that never heard God's word, are to be excused for
their ignorance; we may not think God will be so hard, angry, cruel or
unjust as to condemn any man <span lang="la">indicta causa</span>.</q> They alone (he holds) are in
the state of damnation that refuse Christ's mercy and grace, when it is
offered. Many worthy Greeks and Romans, good moral honest men, that kept
the law of nature, did to others as they would be done to themselves, as
certainly saved, he concludes, as they were that lived uprightly before the
law of Moses. They were acceptable in. God's sight, as Job was, the Magi,
the queen of Sheba, Darius of Persia, Socrates, Aristides, Cato, Curius,
Tully, Seneca, and many other philosophers, upright livers, no matter of
what religion, as Cornelius, out of any nation, so that he live honestly,
call on God, trust in him, fear him, he shall be saved. This opinion was
formerly maintained by the Valentinian and Basiledian heretics, revived of
late in <a href="#note6802">[6802]</a>Turkey, of what sect Rustan Bassa was patron, defended by
<a href="#note6803">[6803]</a>Galeatius <a href="#note6804">[6804]</a>Erasmus, by Zuinglius <span class="cite">in exposit. fidei ad Regem
Galliae</span>, whose tenet Bullinger vindicates, and Gualter approves in a just
apology with many arguments. There be many Jesuits that follow these
Calvinists in this behalf, Franciscus Buchsius Moguntinus, Andradius
Consil. Trident, many schoolmen that out of the <span class="bibcite">1 Rom. v. 18. 19.</span> are
verily persuaded that those good works of the Gentiles did so far please
God, that they might <span lang="la">vitam aeternam promereri</span>, and be saved in the end.
Sesellius, and Benedictus Justinianus in his comment on the first of the
Romans, Mathias Ditmarsh the politician, with many others, hold a
mediocrity, they may be <span lang="la">salute non indigni</span> but they will not absolutely
decree it. Hofmannus, a Lutheran professor of Helmstad, and many of his
followers, with most of our church, and papists, are stiff against it.
Franciscus Collius hath fully censured all opinions in his Five Books, <span class="cite">de
Paganorum animabus post mortem</span>, and amply dilated this question, which
whoso will may peruse. But to return to my author, his conclusion is, that
not only wicked livers, blasphemers, reprobates, and such as reject God's
grace, <q>but that the devils themselves shall be saved at last,</q> as
<a href="#note6805">[6805]</a>Origen himself long since delivered in his works, and our late
<a href="#note6806">[6806]</a>Socinians defend, Ostorodius, <span class="cite">cap. 41. institut.</span> Smaltius, &amp;c. Those
terms of all and for ever in Scripture, are not eternal, but only denote a
longer time, which by many examples they prove. The world shall end like a
comedy, and we shall meet at last in heaven, and live in bliss altogether,
or else in conclusion, <span lang="la">in nihil evanescere.</span> For how can he be merciful
that shall condemn any creature to eternal unspeakable punishment, for one
small temporary fault, all posterity, so many myriads for one and another
man's offence, <span lang="la">quid meruistis oves</span>? But these absurd paradoxes are
exploded by our church, we teach otherwise. That this vocation,
predestination, election, reprobation, <span lang="la">non ex corrupta massa, praeviso,
fide</span>, as our Arminians, or <span lang="la">ex praevisis operibus</span>, as our papists, <span lang="la">non ex
praeteritione</span>, but God's absolute decree <span lang="la">ante mundum creatum</span>, (as many of
our church hold) was from the beginning, before the foundation of the world
was laid, or <span lang="la">homo conditus</span>, (or from Adam's fall, as others will, <span lang="la">homo
lapsus objectum est reprobationis</span>) with <span lang="la">perseverantia sanctorum</span>, we must
be certain of our salvation, we may fall but not finally, which our
Arminians will not admit. According to his immutable, eternal, just decree
and counsel of saving men and angels, God calls all, and would have all to
be saved according to the efficacy of vocation: all are invited, but only
the elect apprehended: the rest that are unbelieving, impenitent, whom God
in his just judgment leaves to be punished for their sins, are in a
reprobate sense; yet we must not determine who are such, condemn ourselves
or others, because we have a universal invitation; all are commanded to
believe, and we know not how soon or how late our end may be received. I
might have said more of this subject; but forasmuch as it is a forbidden
question, and in the preface or declaration to the articles of the church,
printed 1633, to avoid factions and altercations, we that are university
divines especially, are prohibited <q>all curious search, to print or preach,
or draw the article aside by our own sense and comments upon pain of
ecclesiastical censure.</q> I will surcease, and conclude with <a href="#note6807">[6807]</a>Erasmus of
such controversies: <span lang="la">Pugnet qui volet, ego censeo leges majorum reverenter
suscipiendas, et religiose observandas, velut a Deo profectas; nec esse
tutum, nec esse pium, de potestate publica sinistram concipere aut serere
suspicionem. Et siquid est tyrannidis, quod tamen non cogat ad impietatem,
satius est ferre, quam seditiose reluctari.</span>

<p>But to my former task. The last main torture and trouble of a distressed
mind, is not so much this doubt of election, and that the promises of grace
are smothered and extinct in them, nay quite blotted out, as they suppose,
but withal God's heavy wrath, a most intolerable pain and grief of heart
seizeth on them: to their thinking they are already damned, they suffer the
pains of hell, and more than possibly can be expressed, they smell
brimstone, talk familiarly with devils, hear and see chimeras, prodigious,
uncouth shapes, bears, owls, antiques, black dogs, fiends, hideous
outcries, fearful noises, shrieks, lamentable complaints, they are
possessed, <a href="#note6808">[6808]</a>and through impatience they roar and howl, curse,
blaspheme, deny God, call his power in question, abjure religion, and are
still ready to offer violence unto themselves, by hanging, drowning, &amp;c.
Never any miserable wretch from the beginning of the world was in such a
woeful case. To such persons I oppose God's mercy and his justice; <span lang="la">Judicia
Dei occulta, non injusta</span>: his secret counsel and just judgment, by which
he spares some, and sore afflicts others again in this life; his judgment
is to be adored, trembled at, not to be searched or inquired after by
mortal men: he hath reasons reserved to himself, which our frailty cannot
apprehend. He may punish all if he will, and that justly for sin; in that
he doth it in some, is to make a way for his mercy that they repent and be
saved, to heal them, to try them, exercise their patience, and make them
call upon him, to confess their sins and pray unto him, as David did, <span class="bibcite">Psalm
cxix. 137.</span> <q>Righteous art thou, O Lord, and just are thy judgments.</q> As the
poor publican, <span class="bibcite">Luke xviii. 13.</span> <q>Lord have mercy upon me a miserable
sinner.</q> To put confidence and have an assured hope in him, as Job had,
<span class="bibcite">xiii. 15.</span> <q>Though he kill me I will trust In him:</q> <span lang="la">Ure, seca, occide O
Domine</span>, (saith Austin) <span lang="la">modo serves animam</span>, kill, cut in pieces, burn my
body (O Lord) to save my soul. A small sickness; one lash of affliction, a
little misery, many times will more humiliate a man, sooner convert, bring
him home to know himself, than all those paraenetical discourses, the whole
theory of philosophy, law, physic, and divinity, or a world of instances
and examples. So that this, which they take to be such an insupportable
plague, is an evident sign of God's mercy and justice, of His love and
goodness: <span lang="la">periissent nisi periissent</span>, had they not thus been undone, they
had finally been undone. Many a carnal man is lulled asleep in perverse
security, foolish presumption, is stupefied in his sins, and hath no
feeling at all of them: <q>I have sinned</q> (he saith) <q>and what evil shall come
unto me,</q> <span class="bibcite">Eccles. v. 4</span>, and <q>Tush, how shall God know it?</q> and so in a
reprobate sense goes down to hell. But here, <span lang="la">Cynthius aurem vellit</span>, God
pulls them by the ear, by affliction, he will bring them to heaven and
happiness; <q>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted,</q>
<span class="bibcite">Matt. v. 4</span>, a blessed and a happy state, if considered aright, it is, to be
so troubled. <q>It is good for me that I have been afflicted,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psal. cxix.</span>
<q>before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep Thy word.</q>
<q>Tribulation works patience, patience hope,</q> <span class="bibcite">Rom. v. 4</span>, and by such like
crosses and calamities we are driven from the stake of security. So that
affliction is a school or academy, wherein the best scholars are prepared
to the commencements of the Deity. And though it be most troublesome and
grievous for the time, yet know this, it comes by God's permission and
providence; He is a spectator of thy groans and tears, still present with
thee, the very hairs of thy head are numbered, not one of them can fall to
the ground without the express will of God: he will not suffer thee to be
tempted above measure, he corrects us all, <a href="#note6809">[6809]</a><span lang="la">numero, pondere, et
mensura</span>, the Lord will not quench the smoking flax, or break the bruised
reed, <span lang="la">Tentat</span> (saith Austin) <span lang="la">non ut obruat, sed ut coronet</span> he suffers
thee to be tempted for thy good. And as a mother doth handle her child sick
and weak, not reject it, but with all tenderness observe and keep it, so
doth God by us, not forsake us in our miseries, or relinquish us for our
imperfections, but with all pity and compassion support and receive us;
whom he loves, he loves to the end. <span class="bibcite">Rom. viii.</span> <q>Whom He hath elected, those
He hath called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.</q> Think not then thou
hast lost the Spirit, that thou art forsaken of God, be not overcome with
heaviness of heart, but as David said, <q>I will not fear though I walk in
the shadows of death.</q> We must all go, <span lang="la">non a deliciis ad delicias</span>,
<a href="#note6810">[6810]</a>but from the cross to the crown, by hell to heaven, as the old Romans
put Virtue's temple in the way to that of Honour; we must endure sorrow and
misery in this life. 'Tis no new thing this, God's best servants and
dearest children have been so visited and tried. Christ in the garden cried
out, <q>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</q> His son by nature, as
thou art by adoption and grace. Job, in his anguish, said, <q>The arrows of
the Almighty God were in him,</q> <span class="bibcite">Job vi. 4.</span> <q>His terrors fought against him,
the venom drank up his spirit,</q> <span class="bibcite">cap. xiii. 26.</span> He saith, <q>God was his
enemy, writ bitter things against him</q> (<span class="bibcite">xvi. 9.</span>) <q>hated him.</q> His heavy wrath
had so seized on his soul. David complains, <q>his eyes were eaten up, sunk
into his head,</q> <span class="bibcite">Ps. vi. 7</span>, <q>his moisture became as the drought in summer,
his flesh was consumed, his bones vexed:</q> yet neither Job nor David did
finally despair. Job would not leave his hold, but still trust in Him,
acknowledging Him to be his good God. <q>The Lord gives, the Lord takes,
blessed be the name of the Lord,</q> <span class="bibcite">Job. i. 21.</span> <q>Behold I am vile, I abhor
myself, repent in dust and ashes,</q> <span class="bibcite">Job xxxix. 37.</span> David humbled himself,
<span class="bibcite">Psal. xxxi.</span> and upon his confession received mercy. Faith, hope,
repentance, are the sovereign cures and remedies, the sole comforts in this
case; confess, humble thyself, repent, it is sufficient. <span lang="la">Quod purpura non
potest, saccus potest</span>, saith Chrysostom; the king of Nineveh's sackcloth
and ashes <q>did that which his purple robes and crown could not effect;</q>
<span lang="la">Quod diadema non potuit, cinis perfecit.</span> Turn to Him, he will turn to
thee; the Lord is near those that are of a contrite heart, and will save
such as be afflicted in spirit, <span class="bibcite">Ps. xxxiv. 18.</span> <q>He came to the lost sheep
of Israel,</q> <span class="bibcite">Matt. xv. 14.</span> <span lang="la">Si cadentem intuetur, clementiae manum
protendit</span>, He is at all times ready to assist. <span lang="la">Nunquam spernit Deus
Poenitentiam si sincere et simpliciter offeratur</span>, He never rejects a
penitent sinner, though he have come to the full height of iniquity,
wallowed and delighted in sin; yet if he will forsake his former ways,
<span lang="la">libenter amplexatur</span>, He will receive him. <span lang="la">Parcam huic homini</span>, saith
<a href="#note6811">[6811]</a>Austin, (<span lang="la">ex persona Dei</span>) <span lang="la">quia sibi ipsi non pepercit; ignoscam quia
peccatum agnovit</span>. I will spare him because he hath not spared himself; I
will pardon him because he doth acknowledge his offence: let it be never so
enormous a sin, <q>His grace is sufficient,</q> <span class="bibcite">2 Cor. xii. 9.</span> Despair not then,
faint not at all, be not dejected, but rely on God, call on him an thy
trouble, and he will hear thee, he will assist, help, and deliver thee:
<q>Draw near to Him, he will draw near to thee,</q> <span class="bibcite">James iv. 8.</span> Lazarus was
poor and full of boils, and yet still he relied upon God, Abraham did hope
beyond hope.

<p>Thou exceptest, these were chief men, divine spirits, <span lang="la">Deo cari</span>, beloved
of God, especially respected; but I am a contemptible and forlorn wretch,
forsaken of God, and left to the merciless fury of evil spirits. I cannot
hope, pray, repent, &amp;c. How often shall I say it? thou mayst perform all
those duties, Christian offices, and be restored in good time. A sick man
loseth his appetite, strength and ability, his disease prevaileth so far,
that all his faculties are spent, hand and foot perform not their duties,
his eyes are dim, hearing dull, tongue distastes things of pleasant relish,
yet nature lies hid, recovereth again, and expelleth all those feculent
matters by vomit, sweat, or some such like evacuations. Thou art
spiritually sick, thine heart is heavy, thy mind distressed, thou mayst
happily recover again, expel those dismal passions of fear and grief; God
did not suffer thee to be tempted above measure; whom he loves (I say) he
loves to the end; hope the best. David in his misery prayed to the Lord,
remembering how he had formerly dealt with him; and with that meditation of
God's mercy confirmed his faith, and pacified his own tumultuous heart in
his greatest agony. <q>O my soul, why art thou so disquieted within me,</q> &amp;c.
Thy soul is eclipsed for a time, I yield, as the sun is shadowed by a
cloud; no doubt but those gracious beams of God's mercy will shine upon
thee again, as they have formerly done: those embers of faith, hope and
repentance, now buried in ashes, will flame out afresh, and be fully
revived. Want of faith, no feeling of grace for the present, are not fit
directions; we must live by faith, not by feeling; 'tis the beginning of
grace to wish for grace: we must expect and tarry. David, a man after God's
own heart, was so troubled himself; <q>Awake, why sleepest thou? O Lord,
arise, cast me not off; wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest mine
affliction and oppression? My soul is bowed down to the dust. Arise, redeem
us,</q> &amp;c., <span class="bibcite">Ps. xliv. 22.</span> He prayed long before he was heard, <span lang="la">expectans
expectavit</span>; endured much before he was relieved. <span class="bibcite">Psal. lxix. 3</span>, he
complains, <q>I am weary of crying, and my throat is dry, mine eyes fail,
whilst I wait on the Lord;</q> and yet he perseveres. Be not dismayed, thou
shalt be respected at last. God often works by contrarieties, he first
kills and then makes alive, he woundeth first and then healeth, he makes
man sow in tears that he may reap in joy; 'tis God's method: he that is so
visited, must with patience endure and rest satisfied for the present. The
paschal lamb was eaten with sour herbs; we shall feel no sweetness of His
blood, till we first feel the smart of our sins. Thy pains are great,
intolerable for the time; thou art destitute of grace and comfort, stay the
Lord's leisure, he will not (I say) suffer thee to be tempted above that
thou art able to bear, <span class="bibcite">1 Cor. x. 13.</span> but will give an issue to temptation.
He works all for the best to them that love God, Rom. viii. 28. Doubt not
of thine election, it is an immutable decree; a mark never to be defaced:
you have been otherwise, you may and shall be. And for your present
affliction, hope the best, it will shortly end. <q>He is present with his
servants in their affliction,</q> <span class="bibcite">Ps. xci. 15.</span> <q>Great are the troubles of the
righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of all,</q> <span class="bibcite">Ps. xxxiv. 19.</span> <q>Our
light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh in us an eternal
weight of glory,</q> <span class="bibcite">2. Cor. iv. 18.</span> <q>Not answerable to that glory which is to
come; though now in heaviness,</q> saith <span class="bibcite">1 Pet. i. 6</span>, <q>you shall rejoice.</q>

<p>Now last of all to those external impediments, terrible objects, which they
hear and see many times, devils, bugbears, and mormeluches, noisome smells,
&amp;c. These may come, as I have formerly declared in my precedent discourse
of the Symptoms of Melancholy, from inward causes; as a concave glass
reflects solid bodies, a troubled brain for want of sleep, nutriment, and
by reason of that agitation of spirits to which Hercules de Saxonia
attributes all symptoms almost, may reflect and show prodigious shapes, as
our vain fear and crazed phantasy shall suggest and feign, as many silly
weak women and children in the dark, sick folks, and frantic for want of
repast and sleep, suppose they see that they see not: many times such
terriculaments may proceed from natural causes, and all other senses may
be deluded. Besides, as I have said, this humour is <span lang="la">balneum diaboli</span>, the
devil's bath, by reason of the distemper of humours, and infirm organs in
us: he may so possess us inwardly to molest us, as he did Saul and others,
by God's permission: he is prince of the air, and can transform himself
into several shapes, delude all our senses for a time, but his power is
determined, he may terrify us, but not hurt; God hath given <q>His angels
charge over us, He is a wall round about his people,</q> <span class="bibcite">Psal. xci. 11, 12.</span>
There be those that prescribe physic in such cases, 'tis God's instrument
and not unfit. The devil works by mediation of humours, and mixed diseases
must have mixed remedies. Levinus Lemnius <span class="cite">cap. 57 &amp; 58, exhort. ad
vit. ep. instit.</span> is very copious on this subject, besides that chief
remedy of confidence in God, prayer, hearty repentance, &amp;c., of which for
your comfort and instruction, read Lavater <span class="cite">de spectris part. 3. cap. 5.
and 6.</span> Wierus <span class="cite">de praestigiis daemonum lib. 5.</span> to Philip Melancthon, and
others, and that Christian armour which Paul prescribes; he sets down
certain amulets, herbs, and precious stones, which have marvellous virtues
all, <span lang="la">profligandis daemonibus</span>, to drive away devils and their illusions.
Sapphires, chrysolites, carbuncles, &amp;c. <span lang="la">Quae mira virtute pollent ad
lemures, stryges, incubos, genios aereos arcendos, si veterum monumentis
habenda fides.</span> Of herbs, he reckons us pennyroyal, rue, mint, angelica,
peony: Rich. Argentine <span class="cite">de praestigiis daemonum, cap. 20</span>, adds, hypericon
or St. John's wort, <span lang="la">perforata herba</span>, which by a divine virtue drives away
devils, and is therefore <span lang="la">fuga daemonum</span>: all which rightly used by their
suffitus, <span lang="la">Daemonum vexationibus obsistunt, afflictas mentes a daemonibus
relevant, et venenatis Jiimis</span>, expel devils themselves, and all devilish
illusions. Anthony Musa, the Emperor Augustus, his physician, <span class="cite">cap. 6, de
Betonia</span>, approves of betony to this purpose; <a href="#note6812">[6812]</a>the ancients used
therefore to plant it in churchyards, because it was held to be an holy
herb and good against fearful visions, did secure such places as it grew
in, and sanctified those persons that carried it about them. <span lang="la">Idem fere
Mathiolus in dioscoridem.</span> Others commend accurate music, so Saul was
helped by David's harp. Fires to be made in such rooms where spirits haunt,
good store of lights to be set up, odours, perfumes, and suffumigations, as
the angel taught Tobias, of brimstone and bitumen, thus, myrrh, briony
root, with many such simples which Wecker hath collected, <span class="cite">lib. 15, de
secretis, cap. 15.</span> <span lang="la">&#x2643; sulphuris drachmam unam, recoquatur in vitis albae,
aqua, ut dilutius sit sulphur; detur aegro: nam daemones sunt morbi</span> (saith
Rich. Argentine, <span class="cite">lib. de praestigiis daemonum, cap. ult.</span>) Vigetus hath a
far larger receipt to this purpose, which the said Wecker cites out of
Wierus, <span lang="la">&#x2643; sulphuris, vini, bituminis, opoponacis, galbani, castorei</span>,
&amp;c. Why sweet perfumes, fires and so many lights should be used in such
places, Ernestus Burgravius Lucerna <span class="cite">vitae, et mortis</span>, and Fortunius
Lycetus assigns this cause, <span lang="la">quod his boni genii provocentur, mali
arceaniur</span>; <q>because good spirits are well pleased with, but evil abhor
them!</q> And therefore those old Gentiles, present Mahometans, and Papists
have continual lamps burning in their churches all day and all night,
lights at funerals and in their graves; <span lang="la">lucernae ardentes ex auro
liquefacto</span> for many ages to endure (saith Lazius), <span lang="la">ne daemones corpus
laedant</span>; lights ever burning as those vestal virgins. Pythonissae maintained
heretofore, with many such, of which read Tostatus in <span class="cite">2 Reg. cap. 6.
quaest. 43</span>, Thyreus, <span class="cite">cap. 57, 58, 62, &amp;c. de locis infestis</span>, Pictorius
Isagog. <span class="cite">de daemonibus</span>, &amp;c., see more in them. Cardan would have the party
affected wink altogether in such a case, if he see aught that offends him,
or cut the air with a sword in such places they walk and abide; <span lang="la">gladiis
enim et lanceis terrentur</span>, shoot a pistol at them, for being aerial bodies
(as Caelius Rhodiginus, <span class="cite">lib. 1. cap. 29.</span> Tertullian, Origen, Psellas,
and many hold), if stroken, they feel pain. Papists commonly enjoin and
apply crosses, holy water, sanctified beads, amulets, music, ringing of
bells, for to that end are they consecrated, and by them baptised,
characters, counterfeit relics, so many masses, peregrinations, oblations,
adjurations, and what not? Alexander Albertinus a, Rocha, Petrus Thyreus,
and Hieronymus Mengus, with many other pontificial writers, prescribe and
set down several forms of exorcisms, as well to houses possessed with
devils, as to demoniacal persons; but I am of <a href="#note6813">[6813]</a>Lemnius's mind, 'tis
but <span lang="la">damnosa adjuratio, aut potius ludificatio</span>, a mere mockery, a
counterfeit charm, to no purpose, they are fopperies and fictions, as that
absurd <a href="#note6814">[6814]</a>story is amongst the rest, of a penitent woman seduced by a
magician in France, at St. Bawne, exorcised by Domphius, Michaelis, and a
company of circumventing friars. If any man (saith Lemnius) will attempt
such a thing, without all those juggling circumstances, astrological
elections of time, place, prodigious habits, fustian, big, sesquipedal
words, spells, crosses, characters, which exorcists ordinarily use, let him
follow the example of Peter and John, that without any ambitious swelling
terms, cured a lame man. Acts iii. <q>In the name of Christ Jesus rise and
walk.</q> His name alone is the best and only charm against all such
diabolical illusions, so doth Origen advise: and so Chrysostom, <span lang="la">Haec erit
tibi baculus, haec turris inexpugnabilis, haec armatura. Nos quid ad haec
dicemus, plures fortasse expectabunt</span>, saith St. Austin. Many men will
desire my counsel and opinion what is to be done in this behalf; I can say
no more, <span lang="la">quam ut vera fide, quae per dilectionem operatur, ad Deum unum
fugiamus</span>, let them fly to God alone for help. Athanasius in his book, <span class="cite">De
variis quaest.</span> prescribes as a present charm against devils, the beginning
of the <span class="bibcite">lxvii. Psalm.</span> <span lang="la">Exurgat Deus, dissipentur inimici</span>, &amp;c. But the best
remedy is to fly to God, to call on him, hope, pray, trust, rely on him, to
commit ourselves wholly to him. What the practice of the primitive church
was in this behalf, <span lang="la">Et quis daemonia ejiciendi modus</span>, read Wierus at
large, <span class="cite">lib. 5. de Cura. Lam. meles. cap. 38. et deinceps.</span>

<p>Last of all: if the party affected shall certainly know this malady to have
proceeded from too much fasting, meditation, precise life, contemplation of
God's judgments (for the devil deceives many by such means), in that other
extreme he circumvents melancholy itself, reading some books, treatises,
hearing rigid preachers, &amp;c. If he shall perceive that it hath begun first
from some great loss, grievous accident, disaster, seeing others in like
case, or any such terrible object, let him speedily remove the cause, which
to the cure of this disease Navarras so much commends, <a href="#note6815">[6815]</a><span lang="la">avertat
cogitationem a re scrupulosa</span>, by all opposite means, art, and industry,
let him <span lang="la">laxare animum</span>, by all honest recreations, <q>refresh and recreate
his distressed soul;</q> let him direct his thoughts, by himself and other of
his friends. Let him read no more such tracts or subjects, hear no more
such fearful tones, avoid such companies, and by all means open himself,
submit himself to the advice of good physicians and divines, which is
<span lang="la">contraventio scrupulorum</span>, as <a href="#note6816">[6816]</a>he calls it, hear them speak to whom the
Lord hath given the tongue of the learned, to be able to minister a word to
him that is weary, <a href="#note6817">[6817]</a>whose words are as flagons of wine. Let him not be
obstinate, headstrong, peevish, wilful, self-conceited (as in this malady
they are), but give ear to good advice, be ruled and persuaded; and no
doubt but such good counsel may prove as preposterous to his soul, as the
angel was to Peter, that opened the iron gates, loosed his bands, brought
him out of prison, and delivered him from bodily thraldom; they may ease
his afflicted mind, relieve his wounded soul, and take him out of the jaws
of hell itself. I can say no more, or give better advice to such as are any
way distressed in this kind, than what I have given and said. Only take
this for a corollary and conclusion, as thou tenderest thine own welfare in
this, and all other melancholy, thy good health of body and mind, observe
this short precept, give not way to solitariness and idleness. <q>Be not
solitary, be not idle.</q>

<p>SPERATE MISERI&mdash;UNHAPPY HOPE.
<p>CAVETE FELICES&mdash;HAPPY BE CAUTIOUS.

<p><span lang="la">Vis a dubio liberari? vis quod incertum est evadere? Age poenitentiam dum
sanus es; sic agens, dico tibi quod securus es, quod poenitentiam egisti
eo tempore quo peccare potuisti.</span> Austin. <q>Do you wish to be freed from
doubts? do you desire to escape uncertainty? Be penitent whilst rational:
by so doing I assert that you are safe, because you have devoted that time
to penitence in which you might have been guilty of sin.</q>

<div class="note"><a name="note4442">4442</a>. <q>The poet himself should be chaste and pious, but his verses need not imitate him in these respects; they may therefore contain wit and humour.</q></div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4443">4443</a>. <q>This that I write depends sometimes upon the opinion and authority of others: nor perhaps am I frantic, I only follow madmen: But thus far I may be deranged: we have all been so at some one time, and yourself, I think, art sometimes insane, and this man, and that man, and I also.</q></div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4464">4464</a>. Desiderium optantis, amor eorum quibus fruimur; amoris principium, desiderii finis, amatum adest.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4465">4465</a>. Principio l. de amore. Operae pretium est de amore considerare, utrum Deus, an Daemon, an passio quaedam animae, an partim Deus, partim Daemon, passio partim, &amp;c. Amor est aetus animi bonum desiderans.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4469">4469</a>. Non est amor desiderium aut appetitus ut ab omnibus hactenus traditim; nam cum potimur amata re, non manet appetitus; est igitur affectus quo cum re amata aut unimur, aut unionem perpetuamus.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4473">4473</a>. Amabile objectum amoris et scopus, cujus adeptio est finis, cujus gratia amamus. Animus enim aspirat ut eo fruator, et formam boni habet et praecipue videtur et placet. Picolomineus, grad. 7. cap. 2. et grad. 8. cap. 35.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4474">4474</a>. Forma est vitalis fulgor ex ipso bono manans per ideas, semina, rationes, umbras effusus, animos excitans ut per bonum in unum redigantur.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4475">4475</a>. Pulchritudo est perfectio compositi ex congruente ordine, mensura et ratione partium consurgens, et venustas inde prodiens gratia dicitur et res omnes pulchrae gratiosae.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4476">4476</a>. Gratia et pulchritudo ita suaviter animos demulcent, ita vehementer alluciunt, et admirabiliter connectuntur, ut in inum confundant et distingui non possunt et sunt tanquam radii et splendores divini solis in rebus variis vario modo fulgentes.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4477">4477</a>. Species pulchrituninis hauriuntur oculis, auribus, aut concipiuntur interna mente.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4482">4482</a>. Alter ad superna erigit, alter deprimit ad inferna.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4483">4483</a>. Alter excitat hominem ad divinam pulchritudinem lustrandam, cujus causa philosophiae studia et justitiae, &amp;c.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4484">4484</a>. Omnis creatura cum bona sit, et bene amari potest et male.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4485">4485</a>. Duas civitates duo faciunt amores; Jerusalem facit amor Dei, Babylonem amor saeculi; unusquisque se quid amet interroget, et inveniet unde sit civis.</div>

<div class="note"><a name="note4486">4486</a>. Alter mari ortus, ferox, varius, fluctuans, inanis, juvenum, mare referens, &amp;c. Alter aurea catena coelo demissa bonum furorem mentibus mittens, &amp;c.</div>
