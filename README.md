This is Soma.

Soma aims to provide online education tools offline to places with limited to no internet connection.

You can view the online version of the website offered in our offline servers here: https://mathewbushuru.github.io/somabilanet/

I'm working on a new theme. You can view it here: https://mathewbushuru.github.io/somabilanet/somabilanet/ (though not yet complete)
